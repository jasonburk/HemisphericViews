(upbeat music)
- Okay, now you can tell the story.
- Yeah, so like I was going to say
before we started recording,
my sister Jodie is just nuts for Better Call Saul
in a good way.
She's not overly obsessive,
But I was just gonna say thank you, Jason,
for doing all of that stuff to help her
with the US Postal Service,
because now that the series has finished,
and Andrew, this is what I meant when I started,
and now that the series has finished,
she's been engaging in all this different fan material,
and there was this auction of stuff
that was used in the show, and she went,
"Oh, you know what, it's really cool.
"I wanna get some of this."
Ordered it, but then found out after the fact
that they only did US deliveries,
and she approached me saying,
"Oh, do you think Jason would be bothered if I,"
And I said, if there's something that Jason loves,
it is helping with or sending things through the mail.
So.
- Absolutely.
- He's so good at it.
- Especially to Australia.
- Yeah.
- He does.
- He's on first name basis with the postal people.
You know, just.
- Exactly.
Yeah.
And we, as we know, like Jason's internet service at home
and his backup, if everything falls over,
is superior to all internet infrastructure
elsewhere in the US.
- It's true.
- Australia for that matter.
So he is essentially like, I think, the backbone of America's mail and internet infrastructure.
When they talk about the backbone, they're talking about my house.
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that was the story, Andrew.
Thank you.
The only issue is the time because shipping things inside the US, very quick.
Outside the US, less so on the quickness.
For instance, the Arcadia June winners, we had prizes obviously, as we do, shipped one
to the US, one to Norway, and one to the premier country of Australia.
And the US won 1.5 days to get there.
Pretty good.
Very quick.
Almost Amazon speed.
Love it.
Yep.
Almost.
version is simply listed as,
I think it exited the country maybe at some point,
potentially.
And the Australia one is always much more aloof
in the sense that it just says, I don't know, basically.
- I'm pretty sure the estimated delivery time is,
she'll be right, you can wait.
(laughing)
- Yeah, it's usually somewhere between eight days
and eight months is the shipping time on that.
So poor Jody is going to be waiting for a while or she's going to be paying probably about 14 times whatever it is that she bid on.
So we'll see how that goes.
Oh, you didn't get that bit of the negotiation.
Oh, do I get to pay for it?
You're paying for the shipping.
Oh, oh, well, that's easy.
Then I'll just ship it as fast as possible.
Yeah.
OK.
Goes without saying.
I didn't realize that was part of the contract.
I can't resist a dad joke that there was no way that Michael was going to get his on time either.
Oh wow, you're just seriously nailing it.
Oh slow.
It's just like there's just a board with a bunch of nails and then Martin just was walking up and
just hammering them in just one after the other.
Man.
That's my job.
Far out.
I love it.
I just got a text message and I message guys I might have to go something quite important.
It's from a phone number.
It says Apple colon your Apple pay has been temporarily suspended.
Oh.
please visit wallet-support.com to verify your details.
Definitely click that for sure.
It must be legitimate.
They, it says it's from, it says apple colon and the number is just a 047 number.
Like that's got to be legit, right?
Yeah.
I mean, whenever they text you, it's usually from a random number.
It's a green bubble too, right?
It's a gray bubble, but it's text message.
It's weird.
Actually.
Hmm.
I got spam from Mike Russ off the other day.
Really? How's that going? How are they?
They have a bigger kind of worldview than Microsoft because micro actually is that big?
It's just made up. I just kind of envisaged that I have no idea.
Do you think micro would be bigger than micro?
Was there a micro USB? That would be the question.
Yeah, micro, micro. I have no idea. I'm just making stuff up at this point.
Because there was mini USB and then there was micro, which was smaller than mini.
So maybe micro USB is like somewhere in between.
Or it's just really huge just to be kind of comical.
So what happens if I reply to this message?
Oh, I think you'll lose all your life savings. That's what will happen.
Absolutely.
If I literally just say, "Nah, I'm good, mate." Should I reply back?
I would reply in the form of swiping it to be deleted.
Is probably how I would reply to that.
I've never replied to a spam. I've always... What would happen if you replied?
Haven't you seen that YouTube thing about the guy who responds to spam?
I can tell you firsthand exactly what happens, actually.
You recall back a few months ago when I got a spam text message to which I replied to around around Bitcoin or something
Uh-huh, and thought it would be funny to exchange in a conversation with this person and it was funny
I got quite a laugh out of it until
My number was then put on some kind of list saying that this person answers
Okay, so where I got many more text messages and then I
I began getting phone calls from humans asking me why the SEO on my premiere website was so shit and that they could help me with that.
So I would suggest not answering it.
I'm just delete conversation.
Yeah, that would be best report junk.
Yep.
Thanks guys.
Good tech support.
You're welcome.
Yep.
Anytime.
That is what we're here for.
Tech support corner.
Is that what we are here for?
What are we here for?
- Well, it was a nice segue with the tech bit
'cause I was gonna say the first thing I can see
in our little notes here is an ARC update.
And I was playing Mr. Snarky topic pool,
not snarky, but pedantic because Jason just, you know,
going about his day probably with various
different commitments in his life,
just through ARC update into the general topic pool
for our regular show.
And I said, I'm sorry, Jason,
but this was referred to in an earlier One Prime Plus
and therefore must be kept within
appropriate context so as not to confuse listeners.
He's the guy in the movie where they do a thing and you're like, oh, that was cool.
And he's like, wait a minute, that is not canon.
Actually, what happened was, and you're like, could you just let the cool thing happen?
Like, come on, just give him a chance.
Hey, Jason, guess what?
I'm going to really annoy Martin as well today.
Because look, I got a topic right here.
You can bring topics in.
I have no problem.
It's written on a card.
Martin has no idea what it is.
I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but it actually doesn't bother me. It was more the fact that
people would listen to the regular show and go, "What the hell is ARK? I don't recall this."
To Martin's credit, I did completely not remember where we even mentioned ARK, so it's for the best.
Thank you.
I don't remember.
We're assuming anyone's listening and actually keeps things tied together, but yeah.
Just for Andrew's benefit, I'm so annoyed and my blood is boiling that there would be a secret
topic that I didn't know about. Oh, Andrew, damn you.
So he did it to annoy you, but what he's really done is just caused me
severe anxiety because I'm terrified about what the hell could possibly be on a card
that we don't know about. So...
And I also like the foley. It sounds so satisfying. Listen to that. Can you hear it?
Yeah, it's great.
Oh, I can hear it.
I'm betting it's going to have something to do with industry standards or some sort of,
I don't know, regulatory body. I don't know. Maybe you just,
I reckon all he's written on the card is Western Australia.
With a little heart next to it.
You may be closer than you realize, Martin, actually.
I'm going to throw the whole thing out the window then and just say, you know what,
we're starting with the card. What's the card say?
What's the card say?
What?
Yeah. You want to bring in cards? I'm changing the whole flow of things.
Come on, big man, show us your card.
It's not how I envision this playing out. Okay.
Shooks on you card man.
Fine. I'll go with my card. It's probably not as exciting as you hoped it would be. I have a question for the two of you, mainly for Jason, because I think I know Martin's answer, but.
Damn it.
Presumptuous.
Okay, enough, enough preempting.
Jason when you describe where you live.
Do you describe as is saying oh I live in portland or do you say oh I live in shady grove.
Which might be the suburb i don't know i don't know what suburb is but the suburb or the look the look how within portland the city.
Interesting I give you my explanation or before after you answer that question.
I think I'm picking up what you're laying down here I think I usually start with.
Think of Western Australia and then it's better than that that's usually where I start but then I follow up with I would just go with a solid.
Portland is actually extra interesting right because there is a Portland Oregon and there is a Portland main.
Okay yep I'm gonna know a everybody in the other one and say that when people say Portland they mean Portland or.
I agree ironic given that the other one is the main one.
I started again.
And and I'm pretty sure the the worst part about that whole thing is that Portland Oregon was one of those were like the Portland on the East Coast was already there everybody came over had zero creativity.
and just renamed shit the same thing
that was already existing.
'Cause it's like, oh, it's far enough away,
those two, they'll never see both of those at the same time.
It's like, okay.
So I think, I would say Portland,
and generally 9.5 times out of 10,
people are gonna know I mean Portland, Oregon.
And usually that's enough,
but I think the next level down from there
is probably not Shady Grove, but the directionality.
So are you in Northeast, Southeast, and so forth?
'Cause it's kind of a quadrant thing here.
So I would say Northeast Portland,
and that's pretty much where it ends.
That gives people a pretty good idea.
I don't really get the impression people use
like the neighborhoods a ton,
unless you're talking to people that are already here
and also live in the area,
and then that would help them kind of locate it.
But if I just told somebody I live in, you know,
Roseway Park or whatever, they'd be like,
What does that mean? I'd say it's Portland. Oh, okay, cool. So does that answer the question you're asking?
Yeah, it does. And you're saying that's a consistent approach across the United States?
Ooh, across the United States. Interesting.
So if you live in, let's think you live in California now. Are you living in, um, what's,
oh, that's hard, isn't it? Because you've got San Diego. I don't know.
Well, California is going to be either your Northern California or NorCal or your Southern
California or SoCal.
But that's more state, isn't it?
I don't want to talk about state.
I want to talk about city.
So, it's like you live in...
Do you live in...
I think San Francisco would be what you're looking for where you're starting to talk
more about the neighborhoods.
Like I live in Nob Hill.
Yeah.
Or I live in...
Yeah.
I think that is more akin to what you're talking about.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
And maybe down in like downtown Portland, the neighborhood thing would make more sense. So maybe it's more of a city like a true city thing versus more of the suburb thing. That would be my guess.
Thank you, Martin. Any thoughts?
So is your question to me substituting Portland for the city or what's the question?
I don't know. Do you just say I live in Wollongong? Or do you say I live in-
The CDB.
Loud, Loud Birdville.
It's funny you say Loudbirdville because just as I sat down, I kid you not,
pulled the microphone in, Babs started out the window and I was like, "You are a jerk."
Loudbirdville. I love that. Can you get a petition going to rename your area Loudbirdville?
It would be appropriate.
What do you think that would take?
It would be. I would answer the question as it depends entirely on whom I'm speaking to.
So if it's someone within Wollongong, I would use the suburb that I live in because people
instantly kind of know where that is, given the fact that, I mean, Wollongong's a city,
but it's not huge or sprawling. So if you say you live in the suburb of, I'll just throw some
suburbs out there that people mispronounce on the T4 railway line from Sydney, Unandera, which is
not Unandera, or Tawraji, which is not Tawraji, because Sydney people have interesting habits,
people would know exactly that is where you are from in Wollongong.
If I speak low-key not low-key just like takes all those people out right out of the gate seriously
it's like next stop Kiyama it's Kiyama please try harder like come on this is your job you are an
announcer on the railway line moving on uh so within the thing's not pre-recorded is it actually
a dude on a microphone no and sometimes it's like for example my favorite was there was this really
enthusiastic guy who would just go next stop Janali it's like wow god you just frightened
to all the elderly people in the carriage. Not to mention they have quiet carriages on
these services and then incessantly say really loudly, "Don't forget you are on the quiet
carriage." It's like, well, everyone just woke up.
Thank you for that. Yeah.
Thanks. So anyway, that's that first part. But to anyone from outside of Wollongong,
I would say something like Wollongong or Wollongong South of Sydney. I actually am very
partial to the term Illawarra as the region for two reasons. One, because it's very nebulous and
lots of people, myself included, often forget where the hell it actually ends. So it's like,
"Ooh, Illawarra, how mysterious." Second of all, I like the fact that it kind of incorporates all
these different suburbs and different cities, because even though Wollongong is different from
the city of Shell Harbour to the south, or Kiama is a town which I just mentioned,
you know, there are little subtle differences about the people who live there. We are kind of
united in our South Coast vibe and the general area and the roads that connect us. We're kind
of distinct from Sydney, even though in the COVID pandemic era, Sydney has attempted to sprawl and
absorb us as part of its city policies. So anyway, I don't hate Sydney, I go there, you know,
every so often, I like the place and I like the people just stop trying to absorb us into some
sort of judge dread style mega city. So if someone in the gong asks you where you live,
and you say the gong that's somewhat akin to walking around in the southern hemisphere wearing
a t-shirt that says "Southern Hemisphere." Kind of. Is that what you're saying? Yeah,
and for a while the tourism campaign for Wollongong was "I love the gong with a love heart," which I
used to mock relentlessly and then found out after I got with Natasha that she loved it and had the
shirt. So somehow we're still together, which is great. I want that shirt so bad. I would love to
have that shirt. They don't do it anymore, but you could easily make your own. One in each color,
please. I'll look on eBay. I'll do a reverse eBay with Jodi. She can send me a shirt. Perfect.
Now with that all in mind, I want to know if each of us, you know, if we answered the question as
Andrew expected, given that he has some beautiful justification and knows exactly how I'm going to
answer. Back on you, mister. I don't know. Right. Well, I don't really know. I don't know if he had
you- Martin, I know how you're going to answer. Well, I didn't, I didn't know. I didn't care how
you're going to answer. It was an open-minded question. Okay. I wasn't, but what, what the thing
that gets me right this is where it all stems from is because Perth everybody in Perth says yeah I'm from Perth Perth Perth Perth right it's always Perth
I got more and more like angry and bogus
but Perth right is is the city it is the CBD that is the the city center that is Perth right outside of that if you stretch all of Perth
It's like 100 kilometres long.
Along the coast.
And it's all these suburbs, but they're big enough in their own right that by the town planning schemes or what have you, they are called, many of them are called cities.
So we have like to the north, there's the city of Joondalup.
To the south, there's the city of Rockingham or something.
This is just like Sydney.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's like, but it's so gigantic city of Melville and in the middle.
There's only cities and they're big enough that they are cities so when you say.
Alien Perth mate you are saying I live in a huge gigantic area that incorporates like 2 million people.
You are not helping but if you say.
I have a feeling this happened today to him and he had a note card in his pocket in a pen and wrote this down on his way home today I think.
He was walking down the street with his Mont Blanc pen and went, I shan't forget.
In that sweater? Absolutely.
It's my hipster PDA, dammit.
It is. It is.
But I just think I need more specificity.
Okay.
Yes, the planes, planes say you're going to Perth, but you're not.
Okay.
Like the airport of Perth isn't even in Perth.
It's in like Belmont or something.
I'll agree with you at this point, Andrew, because for like the Sydney side of things,
just to throw some other odd names out there, two places in Sydney, right, that fall within
that huge bubble, which could not be more different, are called Punchbowl and Manly.
Can you imagine saying, I'm from Punchy and I'm from Manly?
These are places.
No, no.
You can look them up.
Can I?
There's something that just happened that I think may have happened to other listeners
as well.
So previously we've heard Martin refer to the CBD and I this whole time assumed that
was a place around where he lived.
Now we have Andrew mentioning CBD as well.
So clearly this abbreviation means something else.
Can you please elaborate on that?
Is that what a term or initialism in the US?
Not to my knowledge.
Wow.
That's funny.
And what you assume, Andrew, you just assume the same as I did probably.
Yeah, totally.
It's funny.
Martin has said it several times now and I just assumed that was a place somewhere over there but clearly not like it like a place could see me.
I thought it was something that had three names that you just always a brick is your breathing and everything is short and everything so I figured it was like.
What do you think I don't know I just what do you think it is Jason this isn't to embarrass you I'm actually just curious.
Shit I have no idea now and now that he said it I'm going for a loop but I would.
- It's like Portland, there's one on the East Coast,
there's one on the West Coast.
We both know CBD.
(laughing)
- Maybe that's what it is.
It could be, I don't know, like CBD,
'cause here that obviously is like the,
like hemp extract thing or whatever that's called.
So it's like, I know it's not that.
(laughing)
- This is great, I love it.
- So it's gotta be like something about,
I'm assuming C is like something about a city.
It's like a city in a city.
- It's actually much more kind of descriptive
or mundane than what you think.
- Or central, maybe central.
- Central, correct.
- Central. - What comes next?
What would the B be?
- My head's gone so pink.
- This is like. - Laughing.
(laughing)
- This is like, this is like a "Uninvoked" trivia corner.
It's like a special reverse episode.
So wait, what did I say?
Central. - Here's a hint.
The second word, the second word is very,
very close to Andrew's heart.
- Oh no, he's gonna get it now.
- Very close to Andrew's heart.
- Like it is his heart, it's his heart and soul.
Without it, he cannot function.
More important than water or oxygen.
Wow, that's something.
You could say it's even his name.
Oh, so business.
Central business CBD district.
Correct.
Central business district.
I get points.
Downtown.
I guess you would say it's downtown.
It's just downtown.
It's not downtown because it's not always down.
Sometimes it's up.
Could you imagine Petula Clough trying to sing Central Business District of the Chute of Downtown?
Would it work?
No.
That wouldn't work at all.
When you're around and you can always tell.
You can always tell.
CBD.
Central Business District.
[laughter]
Wow, that was a fun tangent.
I need the lyrics. I need the lyrics.
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
thing here I could be completely wrong but I don't in my entire life think I've ever heard
anyone referred to any part of a city in the United States as CBD. All right. Could be wrong.
When you can start road testing that just go start saying it actually in context with other
American people and just see what looks you get. It's kind of like you know I'm assuming you've
both seen the Book of Mormon. Yes I have not. Okay well maybe this joke will fall flat with
Jason then, but in it they refer to Salt Lake City, right? But in a deliberately humorous sense,
the African members of the cast keep misunderstanding what Salt Lake City
as a name is, and it's like Salt-a-Lake-a-City, like it's one continuous word. That's kind of
what happened in this case without any explanation of CBD. Got it. Okay. That probably fell flat,
but I know that Jodie appreciates that as Australia's number one Book of Mormon fan.
I didn't love it that much.
Don't tell Jodie.
And just just to please I'm gonna crack it up boys you know I never don't mind a bit of a song and dance routine.
When you're alone and life is making you lonely you can always go CBD.
You've got worries all the noise in the hurry seems to help I know CBD.
I was really happy somebody would join me on that second CBD but now you just hang me out to dry.
Thanks for the last.
I'm sensing a new podcast theme out of this.
I just I just in my heart of hearts know you're a solo artist and I would never want to take that from you.
I appreciate that so it's a second time of sun today was the first one on the show or this is prior to that was after you wrote in your card and after that person said path and got you I've already assigned the anthem this morning.
The anthem just in the shower at the school it was a I was at the school I'm going to school things with kids do it then assembly assembly.
- A school event?
- Assembly. - Okay, assembly.
- Yeah, Benji, year one.
They did a show about adjectives.
It was excellent.
But you had-- - Good for him.
- Can you--
- No, we can't do three songs.
It's not, the contract forbids it.
- So my question for you, Andrew,
before we move on to the topic
that I think we were actually here for,
but this is the best meandering ever.
(Andrew laughs)
- I don't know, I think we're pretty good.
- Did you sing the second verse?
- Yes.
- Very good.
And you know the words to the second verse?
They did have it on the overhead projector, but I do know it.
The overhead projector.
They still use those?
Oh, you know what it was.
The transparencies?
No, no, no, like PowerPoint thing.
Oh, you mean a projector?
But it was overhead.
Andrew, this is a test.
Beneath our radiant Southern Cross.
Oh, I need to go through the whole thing, otherwise I don't know.
Will CBD.
We've golden.
Toil.
Toil.
With.
Jesus.
Hearts.
Golden soil.
And.
And hands.
And hands.
Shit, shit.
To make this commonwealth of ours renowned.
Of all the lands.
For those who've come across the sea, we've boundless planes to share, unless you actually
fall under the asylum seeker policy of today.
Oh, yeah, I can't sing that line with a straight face.
Oh no, I totally knew that part.
That was the part I knew.
I knew that one.
That was the one.
You took it, but I knew that one.
You are so right Martin, I can't sing that in a straight face.
Like that we've got boundless planes to share.
It's horrendous, we shouldn't be saying that in our anthem if we're not living it.
Oh my god, wow.
So, who uses full screen apps?
Segue of the season, I would say.
Here's a question by our beloved Hemispherian and One Prime Plus subscriber, Michael Furstenberg.
I love saying that name.
I'm really punchy today.
It's the best name ever.
Very fun.
It's very fun.
It's a good name.
I like it.
And it's got the two little dot things as well.
Is it umlaut?
Yeah.
It's just apologies across the board today folks.
What's Furstenberg got to say about things?
He was wondering about the topic, who uses full screen apps?
Question one.
to what are your windowing preference.
Oh man.
I'm so excited.
I've got such a first and Berg answer.
I'm just ready whenever.
So we'll go with Martin first.
No, please don't make Andrew.
This is a great show.
I'm having so much fun guys.
I just want to say this is fun.
Whatever's going on today, whatever's happening.
This is great.
Let's just push this thing out.
First, there's no editing.
Is this like the first episode?
I don't even know.
Um, okay.
That was almost water everywhere.
So happy.
Oh, wow.
All right.
We'll go, uh, let's see.
We'll go in order of color of sweater.
So blue is first.
So Andrew go ahead.
No, no, no, no.
I can't go first.
He can just go.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Martin go first.
Okay.
Andrew go for it.
Okay.
Let me, hold on.
Let me, let me just, let me slow you down.
Let's start this one question.
Yeah it's go easy let's go slow I know you didn't anthem today you're you're hyped up understand at the fields or whatever you're angry about your cards here we go again question what full screen apps on.
Mac OS I assume we're talking about yeah yeah traditional desktop environment so will go Mac OS.
Or Windows cuz I know you're a big Windows user. Yep with your surface full-screen apps. What are your thoughts?
Okay, so if I am using Windows I will often go full screen because otherwise if you don't go full screen
You're just fighting the entire operating system. They designed that thing to be full screen
Lisa and you get menus in the proper place in the top left
For first and Berg's sake I want him. I want to take him back to the Amiga operating system. That's yep
Right the Amiga had an amazing fit. It was a windowing system and you would use workbench as a windowed system
All right. That is my
Origin story of Windows and I believe that is well laid out
The Amiga had a feature that no other PC or Mac has had ever since then it had multiple screens
You could literally first and Berg knows I'm talking about and you could go up to the menu bar in the Amiga
Drag down the screen and behind that.
Was another screen and it could be running like an entirely different resolution could be doing something entirely different it was a screen and i just wanted to say that's really why i got so pumped up about because it brought back memories of dragging down the workbench screen.
to reveal something at a different resolution doing something different it might been deluxe paint or it might have been a game who knows but it was on another screen straight down it's incredible it was revolutionary.
Like a series of window blinds you would be bringing up and down.
Yeah yeah but it was and it was wasn't like a window wasn't the window that you're moving it was the entire desktop.
It was incredible.
How many could you have could you have six of them.
I think you can have multiple. I don't think there was any limit other than your 4 megabytes of RAM or whatever you had.
Yeah.
Well, no, that's too much. 512 it started with and then you got the 512k expander to give yourself a 1 megabyte.
It's 4 megabytes, I mean.
It's 1 megabyte, what am I on?
What were you doing back then? Geez.
All right.
All right. Now, I'm sorry you guys that I probably got way too excited. That was just all flying in my head, that whole sequence.
It's okay. Do you need a break? Do you need to get a water? Are you good? Gatorade or something? Are you all right?
- So now I'll answer the question.
On a Mac, I am like pretty much windows all the time,
like positioned windows, but it's random.
And very occasionally I've got keyboard
mouse-through buttons set up,
so I can tile them left and right,
up and down kind of thing.
Take up half a screen, take up a full screen.
I may use side-by-side windowing, but in general,
as much as I sometimes try to have a system of like,
oh, my apps go here,
I end up having just like piles of windows
just scattered around all over the place.
And then I get overwhelmed and I'm like,
command W, command W, command H, command W.
And then sometimes I just do option command H
to just give myself back that one single window.
I really like the Mac windowing system,
except it's really bad for any kind
of organizational principles.
Especially finder windows,
which could pop up anywhere, anytime, any shape.
Is it gonna be a column?
Is it gonna be an icon?
I don't know, just see what happens when I click it.
- It's part of the fun though, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's like-
- At the end of the day,
you need some of that uncertainty in your life,
I feel like it's good for you.
- That's why I use Launch Bar
and then I don't have to worry about that at all.
Oh, guys, I'm so sorry.
I'm so pumped up today.
I don't know what's happening to me.
- I'm glad we're here with you to get you through this.
- What happens when you sing with the ants?
(laughing)
- I recreated his whole day in my head earlier
and it was a wild ride, I can tell you that.
- My answer didn't do my excitement justice.
I don't think but so you've you never there's not one single app you full screen on the Mac maybe oh also
I'm gonna cat I'm gonna put a little little plus one on this question
desktop
24 27 30 inch monitor verse
laptop
13 14 inch screen are those different or is it the same across both?
I still don't like full screen apps you think your desktop too often as well for drag-and-drop features
Drag and drop. Do I full screen anything? I don't think I do. I honestly don't think I do.
There you have it. You heard it here first. What about you fellas?
Martin, I would like to hear your interpretation of this pre-recent acquisition, post-recent
acquisition, and same addendum of laptop small-ish screen versus desktop larger screen.
Right. Thank you for clarifying that I'm next because I wasn't sure where I've
sat in the sweater order given that you and I aren't wearing one.
- Yeah, well, your sweater is gray, so you're next.
- Thank you, Jason.
So when you're talking about pre-acquisition,
you're talking about a newer display that I purchased.
- Yes, newer and larger.
- Oh, it's actually, well, it's the same.
It's 27 inches, it's just higher res.
So I have more pixels to play with.
- Oh, camera looks great too.
I don't know what people are talking about.
- Thank you, despite what the internet refers to.
Anyway, I'm not gonna go down the whole rabbit hole
of the display thing 'cause the internet's sick
of hearing about it and it's all a bit much,
but just rest assured that I'm enjoying it.
- And plus we're right, at least your head doesn't look pink.
- So my answer is I'm less bothered
by the organizational principles than Andrew is,
but I get it because you can lead to mess
if you're using lots of different apps at once.
I was a very heavy user of Spaces back in the day
when they first announced it for Mac OS X.
I liked splitting things up,
but over time I found that I split things up so much
that I actually turned myself off it.
Great function, I'm glad it exists within Mission Control,
but it's like, if I'm gonna have a bunch of apps,
I'd rather have them all on top of each other
and shuffled between them,
either using Mission Control on expose or command tabbing.
Because it's like, I kind of view putting things in spaces
or having everything full screen centric
like on an iPad, on a Mac that is,
it's kind of like if you were cooking something
your kitchen and rather than having all of the ingredients in the recipe book laid out,
you hid the recipe book when you weren't looking at it under the bench and then brought it back up
every time you want to check it. It's kind of, it's not a way that anyone who tries to organise
too much, I don't need to look at this, oh wait where did I put it again? Oh now I've
burnt this ingredient because I wasted time looking for the recipe book. I don't know.
If it's for you, cool. This analogy is getting quite convoluted. Go with it though.
Yeah, when you start with an analogy, you really just want to keep doubling down no matter how
out of whack it gets. Just keep going.
I thought it made sense. Anyway, so really, I just put everything on the desktop and overlapping
windows. I find that the only, there are probably only three apps that come to mind that I do full
screen regularly on the Mac, and they would be IA Writer, if I'm really focusing on extended
writing I don't want to see anything else. Final Cut Pro and Photos. I love photos in full screen
just because if I want to turn my Mac into a virtual photo album it just dismisses everything
and things just look more glorious. And Final Cut Pro is pretty handy just because again it's that
similar thing of photos but you're really into this specific editing timeline and you want to
focus on the project and have all the space possible for different stacked elements like
overlay footage or supers and text and transitions and everything while also seeing multiple angles
and different things in the inspector. So to me Final Cut Pro is the best app to run in full
screen just because there's so many different elements to what you're doing. Yeah Final Cut
is like the app where you can quite literally never have enough space. Yeah. If you if anyone
says like would you like a little more space you're always going to say yes whether it's just
just to get a little more timeline, a few more clips,
or just to have your preview in 100%,
you can never have too much space.
- And I would say now, looking at 27 inches at 5K,
it's the first time that I've ever used Final Cut Pro
and gone, "I have room."
- That'll last about two weeks.
- And with the laptop part of the question,
pretty much exactly the same way.
And whether it's a desktop display or a laptop,
I'm never really tempted to have a second display.
I did that a little bit when I used to be
in a different office at work,
but I find it annoying to ever have to look at a slight sideways display, vertical, horizontal,
or anything. So I'm very much dead center on the one rectangle.
Okay, there you have it. So, so far, zero for three, zero for two in terms of full screen.
Interesting.
Only some, only some apps.
Some, limited use. But the ones you mentioned almost are in a different class of app where
where they're very much meant to be single use things, right?
Like IA Writer, you're writing and you're not,
I mean, maybe you're referencing stuff,
but I get the impression that you're in like the mode
where you have basically just a cursor and that's it.
- Yeah.
- And you're just putting words on a page.
- Oh, you just, sorry, we'll get to you in a second.
You just reminded me of something.
Two windowing tools that I love.
You just reminded me.
Front and Center by John Siracusa, I love.
I've kind of been on and off Switch Glass,
But I love the fact that you can click on a window and all the windows associated with
that come to the fore.
I love that.
I have that.
I gave up on it.
Yeah.
What?
Sorry, wait.
Can you?
I don't think I fully get what that's doing.
What is that?
So it's an app whose sole purpose is to replicate the earlier classic Mac OS behavior of clicking
on an app's window.
And if you have multiple windows open in that same app, they all come to the front at once.
And then if you want to do only one, you shift click on that.
and only that one comes forwards.
- Got it, okay.
- The other thing that I'd mentioned
that I use all the time,
and I actually do this quite a bit
whenever I'm doing show notes for the podcast
that I do for work,
and really specific stories as well,
I will use Magnet,
either with keyboard shortcuts
or the little menu bar thing.
It's a windowing app where they snap.
And I'll set up, for example, thirds.
So every app will be an equal thirds across the screen,
left being maybe the PDF transcript,
the middle being show notes in Fireside,
and the right being the window in Safari
that I'm using to get the links.
So I just love having that.
It's almost like full screen,
but divided into this triple split view.
- Yeah, I have Moom running for that sort of similar purpose.
- Right. - Moom.
- That's the same kind of thing, right?
It's just a window manager.
Yeah. - Okay.
- Well, I will round out the trio of answers here.
I'll start with the full screen.
I don't full screen anything.
It's just not anything that's ever useful to me.
I tried for a while to be a full screener on the laptop
so that I would like everything had maximum space
and it was fine, but it's just at the end of the day,
it was better just to have all of my windows still there,
but just slightly smaller than they would be
on the larger computer.
So full screen, no.
I like the way the full screen thing works
and how it functions.
I have no issue with if you use it for something,
how it functions, or the way in which you can like
do the swipe back and forth between them.
I think it's a great system, just not my thing, I think.
I imagine there must be enough folks using it
that warrants it hanging around,
or maybe it's like, well, it's done,
so just leave it there, but yeah, not really for me.
Windowing preferences, I'm not that bothered by this.
I don't really care.
I put generally the same kind of window
generally in the same place, depending on what it is.
So I'll have on one monitor,
I might have like the same apps generally in the same area,
just out of a, I know when I look over and up,
it's gonna be this.
And I know when I look over and in the middle,
it's going to be this other thing,
but that's really the only reason for it.
As far as window management apps, don't really,
I don't use it enough to where I wanna waste memory space,
remembering what the keyboard shortcuts are for it.
And if I'm going to go click around in a menu to do it,
I might as well just move the damn window myself. Like what's the point?
So I don't really use those either. I love, love,
love minimizing apps. I minimize the hell out of apps all day, every day.
It's my favorite thing. I love it.
You minimize. So this is, this is,
I think is really important because I think there's two camps.
There's you minimize or you hide.
Minimize. I'm a minimizer.
Hide.
I love the little, the little animation gives me joy.
I would do it just to see the animation, but I wouldn't leave it there.
Yeah.
Once you hide an app, you can't get it back.
You can.
There's no quick way to get it back.
You click on the icon.
Yeah, exactly.
But if you hide it, if you hide something, you can still like you hide it and you can still, um, command tab back to it.
But if you minimize it, you've got to get mouse and go clicking.
Are you saying minimize is slow? I misunderstood.
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So minimize, right? Doing it now.
Minimize those finder windows.
Are you feeling attacked, Jason? Are you all right?
No, I'm good.
Like how do I get my finder windows back? They're minimized.
I've got to go over there and click them. But if I hide them, if I command H it.
Can you imagine having to click something in a mouse operated operating system?
That's wild.
I think the faster way would just to be engage,
she or he who shall not be named within the system
and ask them politely to bring it back.
That would be really quick.
- I bet that would really work quickly.
- Hey person, would you please,
I'm sorry, I can't do that, damn it.
- Your window is deleted.
- Damn it.
(laughing)
- No, have you ever had that happen?
Just quick side tangent.
I've had multiple times in our house,
we've said something.
- This whole show is a side tangent.
And it said, she said something to the effect of like,
okay, it's gone, or like, okay, I've deleted it or whatever,
with no context around what it was.
(laughing)
So like, what did you delete?
What could it have been?
I don't think you have access to files, I don't think,
but it's happened several times
and it's kind of become a joke in our house.
Whatever it was, I guess it wasn't important
'cause I don't know, but.
I wanna add one more thing 'cause you were talking about
like 15 apps that made it feel like Mac OS 7.
And I just, I can't,
personally I can't get behind this kind of thing
'cause it just, it feels like just hanging on
to stuff that's old and you're just like,
you can't let go and I can't personally do it.
It just doesn't, it doesn't work for me.
It's kind of akin to like changing your phone
to the non home button version,
but then putting like the virtual home button back on there
because like, I don't know,
it just feels like you gotta move on at some point,
move on. I don't know. Maybe that's just me, but yeah, that's where I land on that. So full screen
sounds like it's a big nope from everybody. But that being said, it's been a fun topic and
everyone who's listening, the joy that you can have as a hemispherian being a one prime plus
member and submitting really, really fruitful topic suggestions like this, that we just butcher
and go off on a tangent. I think that's good. One prime plus.com. Why wouldn't you do it?
It's in the game. Thank you.
So to finish off this episode, I thought I would do the final reveal of which of the three stories
in last week's or last episodes Storytime with Feld was false, that it did not happen to me.
But before I do, people have submitted, at least a few people have submitted their thoughts in the
poll on the ShowTalk channel and Discord about which one they thought was false. Andrew and Jason,
in that order, would you like to tell me which one, before I reveal it, which one you think was
false? Was it A) the birthday go-kart story, which ended poorly, B) the mysterious program on the bus,
which would cause anxiety in anyone, or C) the unfortunate happening on the train?
You also have to give some kind of reasoning.
Oh, sure.
Of why you're picking it.
Oh, okay. Off you go, Jason.
I thought you said Andrew.
I said sorry.
What have you like?
Oh did you?
Oh right.
This is a disaster.
Oh my god.
Go ahead Andrew.
I clicked B, Martin and the Mysterious Program.
Why's that?
They were all ridiculous, okay?
So let me just get that out.
They're all ridiculous stories.
But it seemed like there was a ridiculous, there was a level of plausibility behind the
ridiculousness.
didn't say C seemed just too ridiculous.
I sounded like almost too plausible.
So B was kind of like the Goldilocks of the three between balancing
ridiculousness and plausibility.
I put those together right.
Bit like you have a round window, a square window and a arch window.
I felt that that merging those windows of story windows together got me to be.
Be Martin the mysterious program.
So for you be was not ridiculous or plausible enough therefore it is false.
Yeah I think that's I'm getting myself tongue-tied.
Okay.
Gosh sorry I'm so burnt out.
We'll let you rest Jason on to you.
This has been a roller coaster.
So I was split between two of them initially I was split between B and C.
And the reason was that B had nowhere near enough details
and C had far too many details.
- Mm-hmm, yes.
- Alluding to the fact that it's like,
when you're making shit up,
you tend to start adding more and more and more
because you're trying to make it more believable.
But also, it's the gong, things happen in the gong.
So like that could be a thing.
So I'm gonna go with C as my answer
as being we're picking the one that's not correct, right?
Yeah, C.
- Correct, the one that did not happen to me.
- C is the one that I think did not happen to you
because it has too much detail,
but simultaneously I want that to be the one
that absolutely happened to you
because it's too great for it not to have happened,
especially the end,
which is around that area of me saying
you have too much detail.
So that tells me it's probably A since I picked B and C,
but we'll see.
- Okay. - Go ahead.
- So I'm gonna go through them.
A, did happen to me.
I threw up in my helmet while go-karting
and it was a shocker.
Let me tell you, it was hot, the fumes were bad
and it's a feeling I will never forget.
You will get to share it with me now.
C, which involved the urine on the train,
did happen to me.
- Yes, I didn't win, but I'm still happy.
- Yes, I'm happy about that.
- So B, did not happen to me,
but I deliberately chose it
because it did happen exactly as I told it,
albeit in Sydney, to my late grandfather.
- Wow. - Wow.
- Far out. - That was another piece
'cause I was like, this would not be legal today,
but in the past, this was probably fine.
- And that's the thing, exactly as I described,
getting up on a bus and having to announce the streets,
this was actually 100% the story
that happened to my relative.
I just repurposed it with my name.
So it was true, it just didn't happen to me.
- Nice.
Hence why there was less detail because you weren't actually there.
Correct.
I can't believe the urine thing actually happened.
Like that is like,
Just not cool.
Exactly as I described.
Yeah.
Cascade was the best.
That was the most magical moment for me.
And I'm not kidding.
There was actual loft on the string, like uninhibited.
That's fantastic.
That's fantastic.
It reached the other side of the vestibule.
Wow.
There you go.
B is the, so Andrew, you're correct, right?
You said B.
Yeah, somehow I got it right.
although I feel like it was by accident more than anything.
My logic argument felt flawed.
- I 50/50ed it and I 50/50ed it wrong.
- Well, thank you both for voting.
Thank you everyone else for having a go,
who did and for listening.
And I wanna say thanks and also apologize
for bringing down the classiness of this podcast somewhat,
particularly after listening to the quality
of the last episode's interview
and knowing that Andrew, you inserted it in the middle,
I went, wow, this has taken a dive.
Although I think I response to your thing not having heard it when we responded to it it was on we were we were perfect and Scotty saying you could make a whole series out of it and that kind of thing I thought well I just you could bang on.
Yeah that was that was actually what I was most excited about was to see how how correct or incorrect the pre lead up and then the leave the out was compared to what was gonna be inserted in.
It kind of worked I think it wasn't it wasn't perfect but I think it.
It was believable well if anything I think this whole sojourn has given a listen as a good idea of.
The great predictability and effort and planning we put into every episode.
Oh absolutely one prime plus dot com a labor of love you ready you both ready to sweater you good yeah I'm hovering here we go.
(laughing)
Here we go, in three, two, one, stop.
(upbeat music)
(upbeat music)
