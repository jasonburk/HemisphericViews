Oh shout out to rob over the room in a podcast i like to share podcast mentions back and forth so.
If you want to listen to another great show go listen to the room in a podcast with hemispheric views listener rob lovely fellow.
It's nice to hear us mentioned on another podcast that gave me a real thrill it was weird i like that it was weird i felt like uncomfortable is it wait you wait is that allowed okay.
(upbeat music)
So, all right, so I don't know what we call this
because I think it was a few things,
but I wanna kick off the episode with an audio recording
that we were sent in by devoted listener, Josh.
Now it relates to Travel Corner, I think, and apps.
Who was talking about this?
- I was.
I was discussing, and this is not the only piece
of follow-up I have received on this topic,
I will have you know.
- Right.
- I've had several pieces of feedback now
related to my topic of certain applications
don't seem to work under weird cell conditions.
You have cell signal, but for some reason, not working.
Anyway, we got a recording from someone.
So this is now a live call-in show, basically.
So feel free to do with that what you will.
I got a iMessage related to this
and I believe I got another email
and then I think a Discord maybe,
all confirming that I'm not insane,
that when people are traveling internationally,
they have issues with certain applications
just not working. So I will say I feel heard, so thank you. And let's, if we can
now go to our live recording of a call that was not a call, that was actually an
audio voice message that came in via email, we could go to that now.
Hey boys, I'm just driving my car through the little nation of Lichtenstein, listening to episode 87,
talking about traveling and apps not performing well. I've had exactly the
same thing, we left home about 10 months ago and I've been on so many different
SIM cards and yet some apps just don't work well if they don't have enough
bandwidth. But the little secret I found is that sometimes it's actually not about
bandwidth, it's about DNS. So often I'll find myself changing to 1.1.1.1
or 8.8.8.8, whichever one I remember at the time, and magically things free up.
So a little bit of a travel tip there. Thanks Josh for that feedback.
Excellent to hear that others suffer the same fate. And top tip of DNS. It's very weird because this is travel corner
It's a call-in and it's follow-up
So really the name of this segment from now on particularly if it's emailed is travel corner call-in follow-up email
Yeah, or travel corner call-in follow-up, you know, just simply depending on how it's sent in. That's a regular segment now
Good luck designing that artwork
I've got follow-up to the follow-up. Okay, so I had a problem
Not with a mobile app, but with a website and not while I was traveling, but while I was at my desk
In fact, it worked when I traveled
When I left the house or switched to mobile hot spotting the website would load
When I was on my own
Internet connection I would get a cloudflare 403 error. Hmm. Well, isn't that odd?
So if anybody experiences this problem the way to fix it is
Going don't don't bother checking your ad blocking. Don't bother checking next DNS
Don't bother checking any of those weird things. What you need to go is go into your euro app or router configuration
service of your choice
Make sure that you have enabled
IPv6
Because if you don't
The website will not load I had disabled IPv6 a while ago because Instagram
Didn't work on IPv6, but did work on IPv4
Don't even know why
So so IPv6 was off. I
toggled IPv6 back on
Suddenly website no longer exhibiting cloudflare 403 errors straight through no problem
I'm pretty sure this just divided the audience
Into people who no one care what's going on and those who don't so people can call in about that
Surely I thought you were gonna say it divided them between those that are devout
IPv4 users and those who have that to have decided that
IPv6 is the way and there will forever be a war amongst the IP
Veers
Where do you stand on this topic Martin? Are you an IPv4 and IPv6?
I was really into seven for a while, but now I've gone back to three. Yeah. Okay, that's good
It's stable right isn't bad. It's good. Yeah three though just feels stable and
Familiar. Yeah in all seriousness. I like four because it's numbers right? It's it's
decimal numbers
You get the IPv6 and suddenly you're in the hexadecimal range and you've got the ease in the F's
I can't get my head around that it's too confusing. I'm too old.
0 0 colon F A colon 0 1 colon 6 8 colon backslash backslash dot net.
I like it when numbers are numbers. When numbers are letters you start to get to algebra and
that's just too confusing.
Well that's a Carl Baron thing isn't it? The comedian he said that algebra was where
they lost it because it's like I've spent all these years trying to get numbers and
now you've made everything letters. What's the deal?
Exactly.
It should have been IPV... C.
I think we could transition out of travel corner follow-up email IPV8 corner corner.
What is... where do we go from there? Like we've come out of this room,
it's scary, we're not sure. Do we go left? Do we go right? Where do we go? Can someone help direct?
I think we just walk straight into someone else's office and do our first desk review for a while,
which was sent in by Zachary. Thank you, Zachary. Now, people can check the show notes for a link
to the photos we're talking about or the chapter artwork if you want to follow along. Otherwise,
just listen to our perfectly vivid, descriptive, lifelike descriptions of what's going on. Let us
paint a picture in your mind as we review this desk. Yeah, we're really good at that.
Who wants to kick off here now that I've brought us into this study, this office of Zachary's?
Well, now that we've kicked down the door, barged in, thrown him out, I would love to just-
It's true, it's what we did.
Kick the chair over and really dig in here, if that would be all right.
Let's do it.
The very first thing, I feel like there was some misdirection here,
so I just want to call that out right out of the gate. There's three photos, so that's good.
It's good to have angles by the way if you're gonna submit it's good to give context around kind of what's left
What's right, maybe top bottom behind just so we're fully aware of our surroundings where we're doing this
We would hate to you know, call out something
Incorrectly due to us not having the context so there are three photos but right out of the gate
I'm like, wait a second. These are not three photos of the same
Desk, so what are we doing here? Like what is this? Is this some way are we sneaking in multiple desks?
Are we trying to we're trying to scam our way into two reviews? Is that what's going on here?
I don't know or we have two desks side by side could be anyway
We'll allow it this time, but watch it is what I'll say
First one I'll go I'll go
Pretty quickly, but if we look at the first photo here, well, I mean
The laptop.
Yeah.
I'm having a real problem with the laptop.
Right.
Just I may just spend the whole time talking about this.
Honestly.
HP Pro book.
Is that what it says?
I can't even see it.
I can't look at it long enough to read what it says.
The keys are just the lettering,
The font typeface choice for these keys is something else, I'll say.
Probook is right.
Trackpad way over there on the left.
Like, not even eyeballed to the center, just way over to the left.
Not sure what's going on there, but all right.
And then I think there's either a really, really tiny extra trackpad over on the right
side or maybe a fingerprint reader.
I like to think that it's a tiny little extra trackpad
Just in case if the one that's way over on the left is too far for you to try to reach for you still got the
Little tiny one on the right. So that's good. We got our big giant headphones
That's fine. That's this is like a lot of cord though that that kind of feels like a tripping hazard
What's like a landline phone connection that thing isn't it? Oh, yeah walking around with the office phone. Mm-hmm good mouse
I got to give top top points for the mouse. I love that mouse and using a mouse. I'm using right now same
So that's that's not you can I try this and I got it. I got it. Yeah, I got a job on the headphones
Yeah, I think it's a good good mouse. So what I'm using now, it's the one I have
In another room on another computer, but yeah, we literally all using the exact same mouse
It's in the other room, but I'm using there you go. I got this one at the moment
Okay, cool, but um the headphones that would be the headphones I'm wearing now
Really they look what I look at they look like it the audio technica 50 X or whatever they are okay so you're you're slightly.
Upset that I just kind of blew right past that.
Yeah and then you slagged off the cord and the long cord is one of the great features of this headphone and it's a feature okay can we both.
Straight cord and the telephone cable style cord.
Wow make a choice.
Don't go to headphones these are your technique at 50 X I think that's what I've got.
Okay.
Point IPV6.
Yeah yeah.
IPV6 version.
I'm starting to gloss over that.
Carry on as you were as you were.
I'm going to get off this photo right after I just say the fan in the back that's precariously hanging,
from the cabinet is causing me a little bit of anguish.
I don't know where the... I'm assuming it's corded,
so it's got to be going down somewhere.
I'm just a little concerned with that.
And then finally, did you notice the wood contraption?
Contraption.
I'll call it.
Contraption. That's exactly what it is.
I don't... I'm very concerned and I don't understand.
There's this wooden thing that looks...
It's a finished product of some kind. It's not just like random chunks of wood sitting in a hole.
But I don't know what that could possibly be. Do either of you have any thoughts?
Is it like a fancy cord wrapping mechanism? What is that?
Well it has some sort of... you've got kind of like a crank thing happening.
So is it like a pencil sharpener made of wood that has a metallic tube that you put the pencil in?
Wow.
Or is it like something that you actually use as a torture instrument?
It also looks like the kids instruments that I used in like primary school music lessons.
So is it some sort of fidgety musical instrument that kind of borrows from, you know, some clacker guiro combo?
I don't know what it is.
It looks like a power brick, like a MacBook power brick.
So it's got those curved corners sort of the same thing you read refashioned a power brick out of wood that doesn't seem like a good.
I don't think good and it's also got this weird snail trail coming out the back of the little ball if you zoom in.
It's like losing some leaking.
Residue what that is I'm sure we'll hear about it though I don't like the residue out of those are those is that like the Apple goggles just below that.
What was it like a prototype of the Apple goggles directly below the wood thing no I think that like a cup like a tumbler.
Oh yeah okay let's let's get off this one let's go to the next one okay next photo is not the same desk.
Completely different desk so I don't even know if we're in the same office if this is the same person who could now.
- The chair is also missing, I think.
The chair that was behind the display
is if he looks at the back of his display
when he's using it in the first photo.
But you look under the display,
or the left one of now two,
and there doesn't seem to be a chair.
- This is a very interesting setup.
Also the wood thing, oh no, different, see?
I was gonna say the wood thing's missing.
Of course it is, because this is a different desk.
Okay, so we've got a dual monitor setup on,
it looks like an arm, like a dual arm thing.
- Good on you for that. - Visa mount.
- I think we see the Visa mount in the third photo.
- We do, yeah, I like that.
I really like that.
And then we've got different keyboard, different mouse.
I would go for same mouse, same keyboard
for familiarity purposes, but he's living on the edge.
So we'll just- - Ported mouse too.
- Ooh, interesting.
And where's the computer here?
- We haven't made a mistake, have we?
And accidentally jumbled up two different people's photos.
- Oh, I hope so. - 'Cause this is
a little bit strange. - I hope so.
That would be great actually if we did.
Well, actually wait, hold on, detective work.
- Martin was in charge of admin.
- If you look at the first photo,
there is a pair of glasses.
If you look at the second photo,
there is also a pair of glasses,
which look to be the same glasses.
- And whose desk are we doing?
It's Zachary, isn't it?
- Yes, that's correct.
- If you look at the whiteboard and the back.
- It says his name right there.
- It says Zachary.
- He just got doxed.
- With an arrow.
- Oh my gosh, he doxed himself.
It's like he's reminding himself who he is, which is helpful.
- Yeah, and I'm pretty sure that's the exact same
stack of Post-its just turned upside down.
- Why do you think they're turned upside down?
Do you think they were like flipped in a fit of rage
or what do you think happened there?
- Maybe he realized that he had highly confidential
information that he needed to obscure in the photo.
So it was a last minute panic, yeah, turn that over
and arouse suspicion or our interest on the recording.
- Is that the Post-it note sticky note
coming out of the screen?
Yeah like a like a do you reckon he had posted notes printing out of his screen as he needed them.
It's like it's like a transitioning between their virtual in the real world.
It is a windows computer and like that you know they do they do wacky things.
That's a post-it note just a yellow bar what else would it be.
That's pretty that's pretty impressive the HP monitors can spit out post-it notes.
How link canal suck through rock spoilers.
I think it was that big a deal he can send through rock.
Ascend the post it no is doing exactly that it's a sending carry on.
Big giant wrist rest good for the ergo like that.
There is a giant cord running down the left side that seems to be dividing the desk in half we don't know what's going on there.
It's cool to love the place there's the full out guy where's the follow guy behind the camera.
Up on top but not in the other photo and if you look at the third photo there is okay.
Okay I saw camera guys so like the old no no strike down to.
I'm gonna assume it's an HP because everything else in these photos is HP.
So probably HP...
It's probably an HP UltraVision XYW24P 1080p 4K 60 Optimus Duo.
It's a classic.
GYMited.
That's probably what it is. Okay, so where do we leave off? So we got monitors, we got camera.
I'm not mad about the dual display. I'm not a dual display person myself, but if that's your jam,
great. Kind of a harsh angle though, am I right? Like the two are not 90, but it's a pretty
harsh angle on those dual displays. Well, you know, Windows, it's got to run full screen,
everything you got to have an outlook would dominate one entire oh that's true
yeah that's how they do it about the dock is there a dock in windows how does
that work the taskbar oh right so we've got a window okay cool a folder great I
think Firefox probably yeah Firefox Spotify potentially green thing yeah
Oh
Everyone's favorite app teams. That's good. Love to see that
outlook
Andrew's favorite
Something it's a notepad of maybe that's the sticky the sticky note printer potentially. Yeah, maybe
Some kind of I think it's an icon of a PC. So that's I think that's my computer
That's my computer. I was I was actually wondering that the other day
I was doing a Windows thing is my computer still is that still I don't know the de facto thing
Or have we done it's in there somewhere. It's got I still miss I still miss my briefcase. Oh
I bet oh that had to be you're like top. That was my favorite
Oh, I'm surprised you haven't changed out like iCloud Drive icon with my briefcase
The amount of time I invested in trying to get my briefcase to work. Oh my god
You would not believe it checking in and checking out trying to get it. It was bizarre
Just to be clear Andrew. You just set a code and open and close it. That's that's all you have to do. Well, yes
When you're dealing with an actual faux leather briefcase
Yeah, if only if only the virtual briefcase was so simple
And then I think the thing that Andrew is gonna be most upset about is in this doc
We have teams we have office we have word
Ooh, what is the one that is missing?
It's not PowerPoint.
Excel.
Excel.
Where is Excel?
Ugh, sorry.
What's it all?
I think Zachary is taking that just to annoy Andrew where he doesn't use it.
I like to think it's an Easter egg.
Yeah.
Where he's like, I'm putting teams in, Excel, out of here.
Yeah, I think he's effing with me.
Yeah, I think so.
I'd like something to be clarified by our northern hemisphere representative.
Please.
That being you, Jason.
Yeah, okay.
When I look at the third photo,
well, you know, you might've forgotten.
It's got a bit of toxi-turvy around here.
- You're not wrong.
(laughing)
- Looking at the third photo, top left,
I can see what appears to be a very American snack
that I don't really recognize.
What is it?
- Those look like, let's see,
zooming, zoom in, enhance, zoom in, enhance.
They are mini glazed donuts.
- Right.
tiny versions of donuts that are glazed. I would eat the heck out of those.
I was gonna say, looking at these three photos, we've really deconstructed what appears to
be two different desks, like he's had some major transformation along the way.
Whoa, whoa, wait. According to your own scale.
Wait. Oh wait, what have I missed?
Whoa, hold the phone. This is a desk transformation that we're witnessing.
Because if you look at the top down, the HP ProBook Mini Maxi Duo is behind the displays.
Bombshell.
Oh my goodness.
So we went from a one...
Is it actually secured or is it about to fall off the back of the desk?
Oh, I think it's just hanging on for dear life.
It's just got cables.
There's like an Ethernet cable.
It's like the blue bird all over again.
It's just holding it up, hoping for the best.
I hope it's at least an IPv6 cable is all I could say
Well, I'm glad you interrupted me because that could completely change what I was about to ask you both
According to your own scales. Mm-hmm. How do you write?
This desk transformation. That's good. We should do a final review. Yeah, Andrew. What do you got? There's a lot not to like about this desk
Like cables
When you want a hard-hitting reaction you go to Andrew for that that's that's where it comes from
It's too many cables a lot of cables be chaotic
Keyboards are weird. I'm really struggling with this
sequence of photos
The whole PC in this of it all is really off-putting
You have to be you have to be review agnostic though. You can't rate based on computer type. That is a rule that we have
Okay, okay. Okay. I don't see how you're gonna get real serious work done. There's not enough mouse surface area that it's not an iPad
It's not like he's using an iPad. I think you can get real work done
You put that ergo pads gonna get in the way right with your mouse and you got a corded mouse. You're gonna be
Cables gonna be jamming up
But then he's not even using Excel
He's got a numpad on his laptop, but then doesn't have a numpad on his actual external keyboard
I
I think he doesn't know who he is yet.
Well, he clearly wrote his name on the board.
He knows who he is.
I think so.
He's one of the younger listeners, right?
So he's still finding himself in this world.
So I think we'll give him a bit of leeway on that one.
So did you want to give a review or did you just want to?
I'm mainly just piggybacking on yours, Jason.
I didn't really want to go bit by bit because I think you did a really good job.
Final number or symbol or like what you're going to give it.
Oh, is that all you want from me?
That's it. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
You're starting your own solo podcast on the way here.
Yeah, I'm going to give this what's my emoji basketballs.
You can pick anything for desks.
Desks is open free range.
You can pick any kind of symbol or measurement.
I'm going to give it a free throw that bounces around the rim, but then goes in.
Okay.
It's ugly, but ultimately it gets one point.
That's, I would, that sounds great.
I think he'll be thrilled with that.
Cool.
Martin, what do you got?
Because I've been given the label of the foot.
Yes.
I'm going to go for the digits that go with the foot, being the toes. Now, as Andrew said,
I'm not a huge Windows PC fan, but I'm not going to let that ruin my rating system here or sway
what I'm going to say. So I'm going to give it seven out of 10 toes. And I give it that rating
because even though I feel like we've been thrown off by the transformation or the different
appearance of the desk, I feel that it's a very honest submission. Because this isn't a super
tidy, made-up desk. He hasn't rushed around to make this look like some YouTube desk utopia.
This is a guy who's actually working at this desk and there are cables and things in odd position.
So, seven out of ten toes. Thank you, Zachary, for showing us what your desk actually looks like.
That is a good point. Martin, there's no Excel. He's not working.
There's no Excel.
Fair point.
I will round it out with, I'm going to give the overall entirety of it a 2.5 wrist rests.
But I'm going to give a sub-review of a 10 out of 10 coffee cups for the tiny trackpad.
Just the trackpad itself gets a 10 out of 10 coffee cups, to be clear.
So there you go.
is something that you would love.
If you would love for Andrew to say that your desk
is terrible and worth one point and is ugly,
send in photos and we can make that happen.
- And I do know that we have one in the bank.
So stay tuned. - Oh yeah, we do.
- We'll do another one fairly soon.
- That's true, that's true.
But keep them coming.
We gotta have a good backlog.
- Please do.
I love a good backlog.
- Love it.
Thanks, Zach.
Do you think he's already stopped?
Like at this point, do you think he's still here?
Probably not, right?
Like it's been--
- I think crapped on for 20 minutes, I'd start.
- Uninstall, unsubscribe, delete, ask for refund,
reverse charge on credit card.
- Isn't he like a security guy?
He's probably gonna actually now attack us.
We're gonna be cyber hacked by Zachary.
- All right, next up.
I saw something that Jason put on Discord
where he went at host
and it was about discussing Windows.
So I took that and just twisted it.
Tell me if it was something else,
but I thought Windows Corner.
- Didn't we do that with Zachary's desk?
- Kind of, so now we're gonna continue it.
- This is Windows Show, yeah.
- And I honestly, just quickly, I just wanted to say,
I wanted to know if we could all share one thing
that we actually like about Windows.
Now in my mind, I thought,
Andrews might actually have something
because he's stereotypically businessy.
And I thought, is this gonna kind of break Jason's brain?
Is he actually gonna have nothing to say
or is he still gonna have 10 things when I said one?
So I'm so curious to see how this goes.
Do you wanna start Andrew?
- Oh, okay, all right.
Well, this is, I saw this in the show notes
and it was like, ooh, controversial.
Is there anything better about Windows?
You know what?
I really struggled.
I was trying to be genuinely thinking about,
so okay, what is better about Windows?
what there's got to be something right.
It has more DLL files.
That's good.
It has IRQ conflicts.
That could be good.
No, neither of those.
So I couldn't come up with anything quickly.
So I asked my son, David.
He often uses a Windows PC.
He's the user of the Windows PC in the household.
I said, David, what's good about Windows?
And he said, "It's better for games."
All right, so there's your answer from an 11 year old.
Windows is better for games, which made me think,
"Okay, so Windows, there is maybe one thing,
and I don't know if this qualifies.
Windows is better at Excel."
Excel is way better to use on Windows than it is on a Mac.
- Why?
- It's more fluid, it's more responsive.
It's gotten, Excel has gotten better on Apple Silicon.
I think just, it's just benefiting
from the speed up of the hardware,
but it doesn't feel optimized for Mac.
Whereas on Windows, it just is blazing fast.
And also Windows has function keys
that are dedicated function keys.
And that is super handy in Excel.
Whereas with the Mac, you're like,
what function mode am I in?
Am I having to hold down function and do it?
Or I just, is it a function key?
I find that really annoying.
I just try to set absolute cell references.
I find on a Mac.
Absolute cell references.
That's the worst.
You just want to put some dollar signs in.
You just want some dollar signs.
God, just let me do it.
Okay, so that's as far as I go.
I went through and I was racking my brain.
There's got to be something better at Windows.
And I can't think of anything.
The one other thing I've got, and this isn't even, it's better than, it's just, or that
it's good at, it's just better than.
So I think all of a sudden Windows system settings what I call them preferences whatever the overall machine configuration.
Control panel was 32 or something.
That thing is now probably going down far enough you'll find old stuff but I think that is now better than the Mac version.
I'm not saying Windows is good as that is good I'm just saying it's better than the Mac.
I honestly couldn't think of anything hurting a bit over here Andrew I'm hurting you know the new system settings is crap.
Don't tell me anyone that is that is the biggest piece of shit the Apple is delivered in many years well done Apple that is.
Hot load garbage I don't care how much you try and sell it that happy shit give me the old one back.
I don't think I've been in system settings in like five weeks, but okay.
What are you doing there?
Why do you think you live in settings?
You can't find anything.
What are you looking for?
Jason, you know why he's in there?
Because whenever Microsoft changes something that requires background settings access or something's running in the background,
he gets a little notification that pops up that says,
"Microsoft Corporation has adjusted background items in your system settings."
And he goes, "Ooh!"
And he goes to check out what it is, and he can't find stuff.
Systems, God, anyway, that's not Windows. So my answer to you is I can't think of anything that Windows is particularly good at.
Right. So your favorite thing about Windows is that it's not Mac OS system settings.
Yeah, yeah. That's the takeaway, I guess.
I did not expect that at all.
And it has function keys.
Oh, and the function keys, yeah.
I take it I can tell you the thing that windows could build in they could make it instantly better they just call it I mean they copy all the time right why the hell if they not copied quick look.
What the ability to push spacebar on a file and actually see what it is is the most brilliant innovation.
In computing that I've ever seen a quick look long may you write would be too blatant for redmond's photocopies I think I should do it.
So do I do they put it in the x86 C folder or do they put it in the 64 C folder like they're not sure.
Which one it goes in so that could be just got your briefcase in the registry.
Yeah windsock maybe it goes in the windsock.
Nobody knows the Jason you don't use a PC have got a PC.
What's it good at? So David is correct in that Windows can play games. I'm holding up a
Asus ROG Ally handheld gaming PC. That is actually why I brought up Windows to begin with, is because
I got this thing and it runs Windows. And I would say that the biggest strength of the device
is also its weakness, and that is the fact that it runs Windows.
There's the Steam deck, which people have probably heard of, but it only runs Steam.
I mean, you can hack it or whatever to run, but like, if you just want to use it out
of the box, like a normal human being, it's just going to run Steam.
Whereas this one runs Windows.
So you can run Steam, you can run, you know, Xbox game pass, Epic battle.net,
all of them, you can run everything on there, which is great, but it's Windows.
So I took this thing out of the box, powered it up,
and it's a gaming console, so you know,
generally you turn on an Xbox or a PlayStation,
it's just like boom, you're in, you're ready to go,
everything's great.
No, this is Windows.
Let's set up Windows now.
Let's go through Windows.
Hello!
Okay, cool, what's that?
Oh, it's got a touch fingerprint sensor.
Oh, I'm familiar with those.
Okay, tell you what, not even close to being a Touch ID,
I can tell you that right now.
It is, if you look at a Windows trackpad to a Mac trackpad,
same thing here.
This touch sensor is atrocious.
I hate it.
It's awful.
It's maybe one out of 10 times it works.
And then it says, couldn't recognize your finger.
Try another finger.
And I'm like, I've only registered one.
How is that gonna help?
And then it says, enter your pin.
I'm like, all right, great.
Here's my pin.
Anyway, okay, you get in there.
Now it's time for Windows updates.
Let's run Windows updates for three and a half days
before we can play a game.
Okay, cool, did that.
Now, drivers, you have the wrong driver.
Make sure you have the right driver.
So what I'm saying is,
there aren't many things I like about Windows in general,
but I will say as a handheld,
if you wanna get something like this,
I say do all the Windows-y stuff,
finish that, put it down, leave,
come back the next day to then play games on it.
So that you've like mentally separated yourself
from the pain and anguish of setting up the Windows device
and then actually playing the games.
'Cause playing the games, it's great.
It works really, really well.
You know, Xbox Game Pass and all that whole like ecosystem
that they've set up to work on Windows,
it actually works really well.
So, I mean, that's Xbox.
So of course, like Xbox has always been pretty solid.
Let's not kid ourselves, but that's Windows.
Did I say anything good about it?
I guess it's...
- One thing.
- If the answer's no, the answer's no.
- It's got... - One thing, Jason.
There's gotta be something
in that operating system that is cool.
It's got... - I thought I would break him.
I thought it would be the one thing
he wouldn't have six for.
I'm not even saying this like to joke, but there's actually nothing about it that I like.
I just don't.
It's bad.
Is there anything clever?
Is there anything like, "Oh, that's an interesting implementation."
No.
No.
It really just annoys me around every corner.
And I know it sounds like, "Oh, Mac guy dissing on Windows."
why I use a Mac because I just don't like this. It's not for me in any way, shape or
form.
So people, there's lots of people that like Windows. What do they like about it? I'm honestly
curious.
I think, no, I think they like it because it enables them to do things that maybe aren't
as easy or as possible on a Mac, like gaming. So it's more of the pathway to the thing that
you want to do has to be Windows but people don't use Windows going "oh I
enjoy this less than optimal font smoothing" it's like it doesn't happen
no one says "I'm enjoying having all of my icons on the desktop to the left
instead of the right" no one's saying these things. No one's saying they want
their trackpad to not be centered they want it to be all the way on the left
and then have a weird tiny trackpad as well nobody's saying that but some
people have that and that's just the way of the world. I can
feel the like, oh, Mac idiot is dissing Windows.
But I'm just speaking from my own perspective,
it just does literally nothing for me.
I will use anything else but that.
If I had to not use a Mac, my next choice
would definitely not be Windows.
I would go through some kind of hell to make,
I don't know, some Linux thing work.
Or maybe I would just use Emacs.
I don't know, something else than Windows.
I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry, that was great.
- Did you go Martin?
I forget, I feel like we've been, I've been.
- No, we went through a vortex of confusion and hatred
but we came out alive so that's fine.
- You can just cut that out, just cut that all out.
It's fine.
- No, we'll see how it goes.
We'll see how it goes.
Yeah, look, I put this in the notes
and then instantly regretted it 'cause I went,
shit, I don't think I actually like anything either.
I can't even make my own brief.
So yeah, I really struggled and I could only come up
with one half thing in that I really don't like
the taskbar in Windows, right?
The thing down the bottom that's kind of like
the weird hodgepodge menu bar dock combo
that has everything but not everything.
And the one thing that I kinda like about it
and then try to emulate on Mac in a way
that I think is better is that you have this wasted space
in the taskbar, kind of like in the middle
or slightly to the right.
I think it depends on the system you use.
And I quite like, even though that's wasted space,
that it kind of has the uniformity of the menu bar
at the top of the Mac's desktop.
So I try to apply that uniformity to the dock itself
on the Mac by putting it on the side.
So even though I like the symmetry of having the dock
down the bottom, which is what Jason says is the correct way,
And I often feel it is because the height of the monitor
is not as long as the lower longer side
by having all the icons to the right
and having it go top to bottom,
I feel like it's more uniform
and I don't have wasted space either side of the dock.
Do you see how convoluted that is?
- Very convoluted.
- What I'm saying?
- Is that even a windows?
What's it got to do with windows?
- He's really reaching.
He's really trying to reach.
- I'm trying to come up with something.
- Yeah.
I'm surprised.
- What I'm saying is that big.
Because it runs the length of the screen with like a kind of banner or ribbon or whatever you want to call it
There's no gaps on Windows. There's no gaps. Yes
I'm trying to apply that uniformity from one edge to the other of the screen. Okay. Yes with the dock on the right
on the computer because I
Do you know what I'm saying?
So I like the symmetry of a dock at the bottom
But I don't like that
You've got these big rectangular spaces either side that I can't do much with unless I put some
Widget music player down there or something right so on your Mac you make the dog yes always make the dock this
The scale of your entire monitor I put it on the right so that it's the height of the display
Yeah, I tile windows or have them I can use maximum height without weird gaps on the edges
But I'm often back flipping on this so what I'm saying is the windows is crap
And I can only come up with some half reason for this segment
So are you telling me neither one of you are going to go to the obvious choice of the fact that there are ads in your search bar when you go on your computer that you just bought?
It's fairly disgusting.
Because that is just a true... that is a... that should be straight up illegal.
That you pay for a system and it comes with ads in the system itself. That's disgusting.
It's offensive. It's offensive. Yeah.
Oh, it reminds me. Sorry, Jason, carry on.
I was just gonna say, I was just gonna try to end on a positive note about this gaming
handheld thing. It is actually really good. The hardware is like super solid. Yeah. And
if you're thinking Steam Deck or other, I would give the nod to this one over over the
Steam Deck just because it is more versatile, and you can load more things on it. And because
it is our beloved Windows, you can basically do whatever the hell you want. After you after
you uninstall office that came on a gaming handheld PC.
Well, do you want me to tell you something hilarious?
Windows. I would love that.
Corporate Windows news.
I can tell you that the organization that I will almost not be working for, like within a day of not working for on the release of this episode.
Oh, perfect.
I received an email from them saying, just to let you know that browser extensions will now no longer be allowed because they're insecure.
If there's a particular browser extension that you think is valid, take a screenshot
of it and email it through to our IT help desk and we'll assess whether it's able to
be maintained.
Not a link to it, but a screenshot of the extension.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
And, and, and in further advice, there was a recommendation to use Edge rather than Chrome
because Edge is more secure than Chrome.
Is it?
Chris or chromium under the hood right and then the final kicker.
They sent another email like a helpful it tips email and it talked about like link shortness like bit.ly.
You can go to you and but you need to be careful to never know where it's gonna resolve to and i suggested you could go to a number of sites that will expand it for you and demonstrate where that would go to and i had to stop myself from sending them back an email and saying are you aware that there are browser extensions that can do that for you.
But those are unsafe.
Yes unless you send a screenshot a random website just branch that.
I'm so sorry I didn't corporate it and we don't want to get back to just say what happened to live in on the edge yeah.
Man I like I'm probably just moving from one corporate it held to another corporate it help but I am happy that I'm leaving that particular corporate it help right so you got this.
You get to go through a new set of experiences with each one.
So I think that in itself is a little bit of redemption that you get to find out all
the new ways that people are going to try to do things.
I just love the way corporate IT just continue to hobble computers.
Like they may as well just give us a pen and paper.
It would be easier.
Because all the features they disable because they're too insecure or at risk or anything
could possibly happen.
Browser extensions.
You don't want those.
Now to wrap up this episode, I thought it's episode 88.
That has connotations.
Yes.
My mind went straight to Back to the Future.
And then I love the DeLorean because it's cool.
I'm holding one right here on my desk.
What?
There's a model DeLorean.
I can't see it.
Show it.
There we go.
Cool.
Episode 2.
That's my favorite version of it.
But yeah, episode 88, thinking back to the past,
favorite memories, let's bring that past,
that back to this future, i.e. now our present.
Wrap your head around that.
Do you have any particular favorite moments of the show?
Things that have stuck with you
now that we're 88 episodes in,
but not technically because we had the pilot that was zero
and 87A and 872.
- That's true.
So this is 80, no, 90?
This is 90 now?
- I think so.
Episode 88 is technically episode 90.
- Okay, title.
- 88 is 90.
Is that what I said?
I don't know. - Title.
Okay, Andrew, you go first.
No, Martin, you go first.
No, Andrew.
- Jason, you go first.
- Yeah, Jason.
- Oh, okay.
(laughing)
Wow, this is really difficult in many ways.
We're coming up on three years,
which is, gosh, it's incredible, it's amazing,
it's like shocking, it's kind of all the things together,
if I'm honest, like three years to do anything is just,
it's a lot, so I just, I guess I would just start with,
thank both of you, as well as thank anyone
who's listening to this, 'cause like, holy crap,
we did not, we had no aspirations when we started this thing
and here we are three years later and 88 or 90,
depending on how you count episodes in.
So I was trying to go back through and think,
or I was going back through the website
of all the different episodes,
and there was just no,
there's been so many things that are now ingrained
in my life as like, like memes, that's the wrong word,
but like just kind of canon of my life,
like in jokes, things that are funny,
things that are just like, oh, that came,
that like came from this world.
And that's just weird 'cause usually you have
sort of your personal life and your work life.
And like I have like my personal life, my work life,
and kind of like this like podcast life, I guess.
I don't, it feels weird to talk about it,
so I'm gonna keep going.
But anyway, there's those kinds of things.
So there's just quite literally too many things to count,
I would say, of like favorite things.
So I have to kind of go back to just a generic one.
So I'm taking a little bit of a pass on the question
in some regard, but I think just the fact
that I've been introduced to and like have made so many,
I would call like genuine friends just around the globe
that without this show, I literally would have died
never knowing these people at some point.
That's how it would have went.
And the fact that it has brought all these people
into my sphere in some way, some manner, some form,
has just really, I think, enriched my life in general.
So I think it's just been really positive.
So my favorite part of the show is the show, I guess,
And what has kind of, you know,
it started as a little piece of dust out in the universe and then slowly stuff
started collecting on it.
And now it's become this kind of unique planet of itself that has reached out
across literally the globe. And I think that's super cool. So, um,
I'll stop there now, uh, to, to avoid going on forever.
But that is my favorite part. The whole thing, a little bit of a cop out.
Not a great answer. I think so. I think it's, I think it's excellent.
I think it's actually the quintessential answer in a way and it's better than mine.
Andrew was going to say like that episode where I talked about Excel.
Which one?
You have no idea how close to the truth that was because one of my favorite
memories was in fact, it was more the kebab episode.
The kebab conversation stays with me,
But I wanted to try and think about things that didn't revolve around me.
So I have two thoughts.
There is Martin's chicken liquid, because now there is never a day happened.
Whenever I get near an egg, I'm thinking chicken liquid.
Okay.
So that has changed me as a human, chicken liquid.
And then I also like, um, Oh 43 episode Oh 43, the Eoffie conversation, just because Eoffie is something.
I don't think Jason had come across, certainly wasn't in his real orbit,
but it's just such a wondrous thing in Australia.
And I think it reflected the hemispheric nature of the show that we,
me and Martin were all about the offy and Jason had no idea.
That's a great answer to what do you got Martin? Well, yeah.
I echo the gratefulness, made a lot of friends through this and it, it is weird.
It kind of bleeds into your life,
but then it's separate and you bring things up with family and they kind of look at you and go,
yeah, and some of them listen, some of them don't.
You just kind of live this weird online alter ego.
But here we are, personas, right?
So two things stuck out to me.
One of them was, I think it was Andrew when he first brought up his
Devon Jimbo system or something.
And then it snowballed into these YouTube videos.
And he has this mustache.
And talking about the time travel aspect,
this whole DeLorean episode 88 being 90, whatever.
I love going through and seeing those little changes
and you go, "I forgot about that."
And those little things that pop out.
And it's like, when it actually extends into video
and it's on YouTube.
And I think in that as well, both of you,
Jason, you responded to Andrew,
'cause Andrew was talking about his system
and then Jason, you were teasing him saying,
"Oh, it's the finder, just use the finder
for knowledge management of your files."
And I think I interrupted both of you with iMessages
with ridiculous Feldfoot stereotype instructions
or something and you're like,
"Yep, here's Martin, messages are coming in."
So I was like, that perfectly encapsulates
Andrew's systematic thinking,
Jason's lovingly smart-ass response,
and my endless instructions from the corner,
all in the same kind of trilogy.
So your favourite part of the podcast is a YouTube video.
No, no, no. It's it came, no, it came up in the audio, but then it bled out.
Like it kind of represents what Jason's talking about.
Yeah. Of just connecting to all this stuff.
But I take your point there.
Your messages were, I think they were in the video, the screen recording, weren't they?
Yeah, yeah. Popped up.
Yeah. Like, oi.
Yeah.
I was just being annoying.
But then this is probably my favorite.
Consider that place too.
Who's picking 10 things now?
My favorite was when we stumbled upon the play school windows.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, me.
Yeah.
Because that was in no way deliberate.
I mean, I found that.
But then for that kind of personality test to come out and be so accurate with the squares and the circles and the arch and stuff.
Wow. I didn't think that something that I enjoyed as like a five-year-old on ABC Kids TV would come to be so accurate in this white man's podcast world that I now find myself in.
Very strange.
Didn't you reach out to the author of that original article or something?
I feel like I have a memory of you doing that.
Oh, I think I found the author, but no, I don't know.
I mean, we could try.
We could look up the author and say, what are your thoughts on The Arch?
Because I can tell you The Arch was chosen the other day when Mac was watching it.
It was very satisfying.
Did you guess it correctly that's when you know you've had a good day.
I love it.
Yeah.
So yeah,
I agree.
It's weird.
This is now a strange part of our lives and memories pop up all the time.
And you know that when your wife is making in jokes that link to it that you've kind of succeeded in a very strange and disturbing way.
Memories light the corners of my mind.
I can't remember the tune.
Misty water-coloured memories of the way we were.
Oh, it's the way we were.
Is that the name of the song?
Scattered pictures.
I know, it's like, who knew, right?
Yeah.
Scattered of the smiles we left behind.
Join in, everybody.
Smiles we gave to one another.
I don't think I'm getting the tune right.
No.
(upbeat music)
I guess I was just gonna ask,
we should probably take a vote quickly.
Do we keep doing this?
I think this is a good landmark.
Do we do a full like board meeting quickly to do a quick yay or nay?
Does the show continue past episode 88 slash and or 90?
All right. Well, I've got a hard out in about seven minutes. So,
the voting should be about three seconds. Um, okay.
I would say raise your hand for yay, uh,
or don't raise your hand for, for nay.
Since it's an audio podcast,
we can leave them in suspense because they won't be able to see the hand raising.
And then we'll call out the voting results afterward,
if that's okay.
Okay. - Yep.
- Okay.
- So three,
two,
one,
vote.
Uh-oh.
Oh, he's frozen.
Shoot.
- Or is he just-- - Oh!
- Oh, there we go. - There it is.
- Just creating tension like an episode of Survivor.
- Okay, well, there you have it.
No one raised their hand.
So this is in fact the last episode of,
no, I'm kidding.
There will be an episode 89/91 at some point.
Probably in two weeks.
- And we've still never worked out
why you put on the 28th of July, 2023,
a few years ago, the show ends.
- Interesting.
I guess we'll have to find out.
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
[singing]
