I just want to say that this last weekend there was a heatwave in New South Wales and
or at least in the city of Wollongong, city of Sydney as well and since then there's been
rain and everything has come inside so now we've got huntsman spiders, cockroaches coming
in. I live in a tidy place and I'm just killing them left right and centre because obviously
Natasha doesn't want to do it so you hit where you don't want them to go like next to the
toast you don't want them to go next to the cutlery or things next to the sink so they
run out bang you get them elsewhere you always use the vacuum with the Huntsman so I am on
it everything arachnid insect it's gone from this house but it did remind me because I
think Jason you were talking about that clip that horrified you where the Huntsman was
running around the inside of the car that was horrific yeah it that's the real deal
in Australia and there was actually one time I remember when I used to work casually I
think when I was at uni I was driving home from doing like a shift in the evening at
at the shop I used to work at and the window,
the back passenger window got stuck.
I kid you not.
And I thought, wouldn't this be the perfect time
for something like a huntsman to crawl into the car?
Sure enough, I look over my shoulder, there's one there.
And as if full of malicious, horrible intent,
it didn't commit to going outside the car or inside the car.
So it's hovering on the passenger window going,
you know what, maybe I'll lead to a car accident.
Oh, maybe not.
Maybe I'll go and enjoy the wind.
No, maybe.
I had to pull over and I couldn't drive I had to call my mum and say you need to come and help me with
This because I started hitting the car with a stick and thought I'm gonna cause damage to this vehicle
It was horrible another time now, you know the difference between car handles, right?
Hey, you've got the ones where you can wrap your hand around and pull or the ones where you put your hand underneath. Yeah
Yeah, yeah. Okay. It seems like a pretty normal design decision. I'm going to put my hand under this scoopy thing and pull out
What they didn't intend in the nation of Japan where they developed this
1994 Nissan Bluebird sedan was that in Australia a huntsman might decide to make that its home
So I've gone to open my car door to go for a drive and the car door handle feels significantly hairier than it normally does
I just felt sick in the gas. It was horrible and the neighbor think about this
Yeah, it was horrible. And I was talking to my neighbor at the time that I was doing this
and she's discovered what's happening. And she's almost fallen to the ground with laughter
as I'm looking at this hand that I can never wash enough. I'm not going to chop it off.
I need it. But what's and I'm just standing there standing there going, what is going
on? And then I have to use my other hand, which is clean to kill said spider so that
I can drive my car. So look, I'm not discouraging you from visiting Australia, Jason, but just
be aware that we do have an arachnid situation when it becomes humid.
It's so funny because everything about Australia in terms of like just the crazy animals that
want to murder you, it's become such like a meme kind of situation, but it just seems
like it's all true.
It's like you get there and there's just, there's a line of animals/creatures as you
get off the plane that are just lined up to murder you.
And it's just like, oh, okay, you got that guy next.
And then this thing gets to get next.
And if you make it through the line, like good for you.
But so we've got Martin is actually like running around his house with a shoe murdering bugs
and yeah, and Andrew's playing XCOM too.
So it's kind of the same thing.
Yeah.
There are spiders.
There are spiders in XCOM too.
And just, oh, I'm not playing that game then.
Never not touching it.
Look just just to make it more confusing I killed said cockroaches with a thong and depending on which country you come from
Wow, that's gonna be very interesting and they how did he defeat it with cloth? No, it's a flip-flop and now I have to wash
Yeah, yeah, that's either either very like, oh, yeah, just use your shoe or wow
They have a really wild time over at Martin's house. That's right
Did Martin have the thong on before he killed the cockroach? Where did it come from? How did he get it off so quick?
We don't know skills. It's not just Martin. I too have had the huntsman in the car situation. I've had it twice very bad
So look it really does happen. It's horrible. They're big and I think they are vindictive
They're the most vindictive spider because they know you're scared of them. Mm-hmm, and I reckon they there's like some communication
I remember one time in my when I was a kid
We had I had a family of huntsman's in my bedroom at one time had it to yep a big one a little
Smaller one and then a baby or one and they I didn't sleep at all that night
It was horrendous and every night before I went to bed
I had to check the room check the room before you turn the lights off for about six years afterwards
I had the exact same thing a number of years ago when I used to when I still lived at home
I couldn't sleep in there for about three or four nights, and I think I counted 53 kills or 54 or something
Yeah
Because that's a lot
Because my mum was saying to me back in the day
She said when you're gonna go back into your room and I said once the kills are over and they were small
But when you pulled your bed away from the wall and see angry mama with the nest
Exploding arachnids you go. I'm a clean person. I don't keep clutter there aren't it's a food scraps lying around
This is the meticulous bedroom of a high school nerd and he's got this huntsman
Litter all over the place. Yeah, it's very stressful. So that's that's terrible
It's very glad you're both going to bed now and not me because I would be
Screwed
Look, you know, you know what time it is now
I mean Natasha's asleep and before she went to bed I said conduct the spider check you look around the bed all this secure
Wow, that should not be a thing on your to-do list. You should not have to do spider checks
You don't think about it in winter
You become complacent and then suddenly summer hits and you go it's not likely but it's a possibility and look Jason
Like I said, don't be discouraged the vast majority of the animals we have here
We're talking, you know
Friendly marsupials little wallabies and stuff that want to pat or just want a bit of a nibble of the food that you have the most
Aggressive thing we generally have you know is the flock of seagulls that want to steal your chips
Really?
It's only if you go to Queensland and you come across
River banks covered in crocodiles under the highway overpass that you become a bit concerned. That's not where you go swimming
Okay, you keep driving to the nearest beach and then swim between the flags. So the spider situation huntsmen are actually pretty harmless
It's only the redbacks funnel webs white tails and various other poisonous ones you need to worry about
But they're hidden in the ground as he just casually lists off like 18 death spiders. He's like it's just this other
25 that you have to worry about not the menagerie over here
We have like 6,000 percent more spiders now than we did from where we used to live
But they're all like, you know little spiders like the biggest one is maybe four centimeters or something
They're very small. They're not giant like they're usually the deadly ones. Yeah huntsman
They are running spiders and hunting spiders. They won't kill you or poison you but they are
They have evolved to chase things and if they're big enough and you are close enough
You can see a bit of the face which is what gets me you don't want to see the face
It should be so small that you can never see the face and hair like any any creature that's hairier than me is a little bit
Frightening. I'm pretty hairy
I just like to think about that little creature that was stealing the french fry the picture that
Andrew sent at one point that the chippy monster. That's that's the kind of creature
I like to think about when I think of Australia is that what he's talking about Andrew the chippy monster
I'm trying to think what you're talking about now.
You said in the photo there was like this little, I don't know what the hell it was,
but it was just like, it's like you caught it stealing a French fry and it kind of had
that look like, what do I do?
Do I take it and run?
Or maybe if I just stay really still, he won't notice.
That was the thing up in Broome.
What do they call it?
What do they call it?
A little marsupial.
Quokka.
No, not a quokka.
Numbat.
Numbat.
Numbat, that's it.
Numbat maybe.
Numbat, that's it.
Numbat, maybe a possum, might have been a possum actually.
Sorry, I thought you were talking about the Chippy Monster from those Smith's crinkle
cut chip commercials from like the 80s or 90s.
Oh, the Gobble Doc.
The Gobble Doc, that's it.
I forgot the name.
The Chippy Monster.
You just said Chippy Monster Gobble Walk, I think, or something.
And what?
We're all on the same page now.
A walker?
Is that one of them?
We understand each other completely.
Wow.
So many things, just, oh, I love it.
The best thing about this whole conversation though is Martin's excellent tasting cars.
Nissan Bluebird, I also had a Nissan Bluebird.
Really?
And I tell you what, they had, yes.
And they were both full of spiders, that should tell you something.
It was, it was the car, oh my goodness, it was like my second car and it had the comfiest
seats.
That was the thing about the Bluebird, so comfy.
It's like you're sitting in your lounge chair while you're driving the car.
Beautiful.
Yeah, Nissan, or sorry, I should translate for our America listeners, Nissan
Nissan knew what they were doing
My mum always bragged about how she managed to get the salesperson to include the car mats and the CD player
Wow, big upgrade in 94. That is impressive
I got mine secondhand and I kind of it was already on the way out and I pretty much ensured it went all the way
Out. I remember one time I was I'd had a big night the night before I had to move my car because my housemate
Was parked in front of me. So I had to reverse out still pretty drunk
I got in the car
Turned on start to reverse and as I was reversing sort of doing the old thing where you look over your shoulder as you're reversing
And I heard this crunching noise
What that is, but whatever I
kept driving
Good all the way out of the driveway and went to pull my head back around and realized that that crunching noise had been my
Driver's door which I had forgotten to close behind me
And it had been wrenched by the bushes on the side of the driveway
So it was actually facing it was side on with the front fender, you know, so it'd been bent around 180 degrees
This is a Sunday morning and I was like, that's a bugger
And so you had to like rip it back. So it was all bent out of shape
I was like, I've got to get this to the panel beaters. Where's a panel beater on a Sunday, right?
So you're going to the dodgiest locations, but the thing is to drive the car the door wouldn't shut so I needed to rope it
Rope it shut to like the strut of the the car
Did you just use use the spider webs or this this is this is the best and the worst bit of the entire story?
Because I was a massive nerd. Do you think I had ropes and things like a cable, please be a VGA cable
So close ethernet cable cat5
You're kidding cat5 cable because we were you know, we'd have land parties
There's plenty of cat5 cable around and I just
Wrapped it around multiple times. That's a four twisted pair. That's like stronger than Kevlar basically
So you're telling me that on this podcast you have admitted to youthful drink driving and reverse on your own driveway
Destroying your door and then keeping it shut with ethernet cables, correct?
And then I took it to a panel beaters and I paid some cash
So there's no record smart for them to smash it enough the door to re smash the door so that it would close again
And they were looking me going what the F are you using to hold this door together, mate caught
And you had to explain to them like do I say it's ethernet cable or do I just leave it?
Compute I think I just called it computer cable
I think you just shove your glasses further up on your nose at that point and then go into
The the data transmission rates of cat5 or cat5e and so forth
This is an RJ 45 connector. I'm an electrician mate. It's a it's a special thing we use whatever
So yeah, and the so the this the the Nissan Bluebird lasted a little bit longer after that
But then it went to God great car. So in the United States, the the Bluebird was eventually sold as the
Nissan
Stanza Stanza how poetic?
Bluebird is much nicer also did I completely offend all of our US listeners by saying Nissan before because I think that's technically more correct
Than what we say, uh, I don't I hear it both ways. I think goodness Nissan
And Nissen it seems like people always say
Nissen when they're talking about like the GTR or like a fancier kind of thing
Okay, cuz then it just it makes because the thing about like the GTR is it's a it's a very it's a wonderful
It's my one of my favorite cars ever, but it's sound when you say it's a Nissan GTR. It somehow makes it feel
Like lesser than it is. So I think people say Nissan GTR to like
Jazz it up a little bit. I think you're right yet Nissan GTR versus a Nissan Stanza. Yeah
Feel like a little bit of a different class so that was followed by the less successful Nissan iamic pentameter. Yes did not sell
Well, I wanted nerd
What a nerd.
Oh god.
