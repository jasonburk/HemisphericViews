Hi, I'm Andrew.
And I'm Jason.
And I'm Martin.
This is Hemispheric Views.
I think I'm pretty much on dark mode always, so it doesn't really matter.
I hate dark.
Are you a light mode?
I'm a light mode guy.
I don't like dark mode.
- I'm a dark mode guy on everything.
- Even during the day. - Too dark, one light.
- Sometimes I'll turn it on at night, but I don't like it.
- Who are you like, do you switch?
You let it switch?
- Sometimes I let it switch, but predominantly,
and if I'm doing real focused work,
I need to have it on light mode.
Contrast, it's really important.
- Do you use a focus mode
when you're doing really focused work?
- No, I hate focus mode.
They need to rethink that.
I like to focus you like focus mode.
Yeah I use it all the time I discovered the other day I'm using it right now it turns on geographically if I went to my office the other day believe it or not.
And it recognized I was there and turned on work mode.
That's clever so could you make a toilet mode where you go to the restroom and when you sit down it turns on focus so you can focus on what you're reading it's just like 15 icons of angry birds you need a u1 chip to get that level of specificity.
Yeah and the toilet needs one to run.
Yeah yes it can be informed what is my toilet not have a u1 chip.
Damn it.
The Japanese toilets, I bet they have them.
Everybody's complaining about the stupid Apple TV remote.
I want one in my damn toilet.
Let's get to real priorities here.
So would seat down be transparency or noise cancellation?
Although some of those toilets do have noise cancellation with the little music that they
play.
So, oh, I would love that.
I'm in the market for a new toilet.
So if anybody knows of a toilet with a U1 chip, send it my way.
Thing is you need power right near your toilet, right?
Like our toilets don't have a close power point, I have to admit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We have to, we're gutting the whole thing.
So we have, we have the opportunity to do that, but yes, you do require that, which
is something you wouldn't normally have.
Can I make a suggestion or a brand?
We talked about recommendations in the last show.
So we've got Andrew's recommendation segment straight up.
Before you make the recommendation, Andrew, you need to sing your own jingle.
Go.
(SINGS)
Wow.
If you're going to buy a toilet, I insist that you buy a Toto branded toilet
because their customer service is exemplary.
I think we're going with the Drake with the S550E.
When I was in Bali, we were so impressed and my sons were so impressed with the
Toto toilets that I suggested we reach out to the customer service department.
He's so good at just sneaking in those like, when I was in Bali, like every,
every time it's always, it's always this, like when I was here, no big deal.
The Cloonies dropped him off.
Mm-hmm. They actually recommended that toilet to him. That's where the recommend it's a it's a recommendation of a recommendation
Our boys were so impressed with the Toto toilet
We sent them a thank-you letter and then they sent us a gift bag of merchandise
I was really hoping there would have been like a stress ball toilet, but there wasn't oh
That would be such a good thing to have on your desk a little tiny toilet that you could just squeeze
It wasn't that but it was really kind of them. What a surprise. We didn't ask for that. I just did it
Really good back and forth with a customer service agent who was actually based in the US. So there you go
And this was based on a product you never actually bought
No, we just used it in a hotel and you contacted customer support to congratulate them on the quality of their products
Wow, okay, that's nice. That's a that sounds like a five-star. Is that a five-star that is?
Yeah, so toto toto toilets
So speaking of
being in the toilet. Can we talk about a little show that I like to call Eurovision? I'm upset.
Talk me through it, Jason.
So there's this show, Eurovision Australia Decides. I couldn't vote, I understand. It's
not Australia and Jason Decides. Okay, that's fine. Should have been that, but it wasn't.
I tried texting it and I got multiple text message back saying please stop sending us messages
It's like fine fair enough and
turns out
that the actual true winner of the contest did not win and
I'm pretty upset about that. First of all, this is your fault both of you
Not me because I couldn't I had no I couldn't do anything
You both could so really this is all this is on Australia. This is on you guys. It's I want to understand
How did we get to where we're at right now?
Because I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed. Well, it's not even our fault. It's not Australia's fault Australian people do the right thing
It's the fault of Australia of Martin's favorite network SBS
Okay. For providing another opportunity for a handful of experts to also have a vote.
Can you walk us through the voting process maybe in a kind of shrunk down version? We don't need
the whole way it works, but briefly. Given the listeners can't see you,
you're actually wearing a Dreamer shirt. You are the permanent expert
on all Eurovision matters this time. So I'm happy to give you the floor here.
Okay, yes, I am wearing a dreamer shirt to hide my disappointment
so the Eurovision voting is
there were there was a performance for I think five judges and
those five judges allocated a proportion of votes and
Their votes were apparently based on a separate performance
that was done a previous night that the voting audience didn't see and
Then there was the audience vote
Australia decides right yeah, and then they combine the two scores the votes from the judges and the votes from the
general population
I've combined together to give an overall result, but the thing is the weightings didn't seem quite fair. It seemed like there was an over
an over representation from the judging panel
And I don't quite understand how they didn't disclose
The judges there wasn't a lot of publicity about who these people were I
Heard a couple of names bandied around but I don't really and there was no
disclosure about which each judge may have voted and
There was no disclosure about the volume of votes from the people that each performer may have gone
so it didn't matter if you got a
million votes from the general public or
10,000 votes from the general public if you were ranked it was just a ranking
So there was no scale attached to it. Well either way I
Think it's great
That they were a part of this. I think in any if we can take a positive away from this
There's some exposure there, which is good and by they you are talking about how banned
The only the only contender that matters
Voyager obviously yeah, there was only one in the entire contest as far as I was concerned
Which is why I was supremely confused when you said they didn't come in first when there was really only one contender in the entire
Event. Yeah, so well, I just want to clarify the results of the voting. Okay, please please do so in the jury run down in the jury
the votes were released first the jury votes were released first and
In first place was Jaguar Jones with 51 points then Sheldon Riley with 50 points and then Voyager
37 points the next one down that is a big drop for a performance that absolutely
Smashed it and if you heard the audience reaction on the night, you could tell like that was
That song was very popular
Okay, so they were there were 14 points off the lead to begin with then that went to audience vote
and Voyager smashed the audience vote. So they got they won the popular vote to
get 60 points and Sheldon Riley got 50 points in the audience vote. So the end
result when you add those all together was that Sheldon Riley won with a 100,
Voyager came second with 97. Three points the difference and if you think about
about that jury vote, they went from 51 and 50 to 37
on a song that the audience thought was the best of the lot.
You have to wonder how is there such a,
how is there a 13 point gap between second and third?
- All I can say is, is anyone sitting around
celebrating drinking a Sheldon Riley beer?
No, I don't think they are.
But they could have been enjoying a Voyager beer, so.
Which I was doing until the results last night.
I was drinking a Voyager Dreamer IPA beer.
I think what the audience realised is what I certainly realised when I watched the video that was shared in our Discord, you know, the music video that was submitted.
Yeah. I don't think that I've seen such a Eurovision song in a while.
It was so on brand for what the competition is.
So I commend the band just for coming up with something that was, you know, so dramatic and kind of cool and neon that it clearly should have been the winner.
Yeah. Well, once again, we are an audience and we have agreed with the audience of Australia and it's not to be.
I keep trying to look for bright sides in that, you know, this will...
In a year that if you don't want to go to Europe, in one year this is probably the year
to not want to go to Europe.
Look, let's imagine that Ukraine, if they manage to get a contestant there, they'll
win.
It gives Alex more time to compose more theme songs for us.
Yeah, true.
So there's those sides.
All I can say is that the good, the other good news is that this has brought a much larger level of publicity to the band.
People, you know, so.
Oh, yeah, for sure.
What do you do if you find a band you like?
You go listen to their music.
You stream it, you download it, you buy it.
Yeah.
So do that.
Thanks, Voyager, for the fun.
And everybody go listen to go watch the clip on YouTube.
It's really good.
Watch Dreamer on YouTube.
Link will be in the show notes, I'm sure.
It's a really good song.
I would say join our discord to speak directly to the star Alex himself. Yeah, he's in there. I mean that's
There you go that elevates the coolness of the entire group. I reckon
I'll go ahead and thank our two sponsors this week
Thank you to any future sponsors in past this week. We are brought to you by
bananas
with 118 grams of potassium.
Why wouldn't you eat one?
So big thank you to bananas.
And also PowerCell Magic battery packs.
They are questionably assembled battery banks
that are currently being recalled
and they bet that you can find one for cheap.
So thank you again to both of our sponsors
of Hemispheric Views this week.
And if you would like a sponsorship,
please send us an email to,
We don't actually do sponsors at hemispheric views dot com.
Thank you.
I just want to pick up on the banana sponsorship really quickly.
Cause I'm a big, I'm a supporter of bananas.
Generally.
I was thinking I was a little bit worried that we were, we were being a corporate
shill for big banana until I realized that Australia has its own big banana.
So then I thought it's probably okay for it.
I think it's okay.
Yeah.
I checked legal and it seemed like it all checked out.
Everything was on the up and up.
So and Martin Big Banana, that would be in Queensland, right?
Yeah, the Big Banana. I mean, naturally, the Big Banana is a building.
But let's just speak hypothetically here.
If the Big Banana were, in fact, a gigantic banana with the flesh of the I mean,
it's technically a herb and a berry, isn't it?
If it had that flesh, if you extrapolate or scale up the potassium content of that
banana, would it technically be a radioactive piece of food?
I think yes, technically. I'm checking with our scientist staff now and it sounds like yes,
they're giving the thumbs up on that. So we're saying that a gigantic tourist
attraction would become Australia's equivalent of Chernobyl?
Yes, but much more artsy because it's a big banana, right? So it's worth it. What we're
saying is it's worth the risk. There you go. So are we supporting
Big Banana or not, Andrew? I'm kind of confused now.
What if we plugged big banana into the battery pack the other sponsor?
Maybe this is your new your new play for alternate energy sources, right?
I think so everybody wins. It's very green. It's a green banana. I don't like green bananas
He's now gonna describe for us the difference between mate mate mate and mate this came through a conversation in our discord
Again encourage people if you're listening and you haven't joined in on discord get in there. It's lots of fun
Yeah, you we can either say mate. We can say mate. We can say mate
there are different ways of saying mate and they all mean very different and they're not always as nice and
collegial as you might
Expect it to be can I say with a bit of?
Feldfoot vibe here that I'm probably not the person you want to ask for views on
Australian mateship because this is the thing people think that when you say mate, it's always positive
Now if I said, "Hey mate, good to see you today."
I just said, "Hey mate, how's it going?"
Would it help if you quizzed maybe?
Like if you said the thing and then there was a reaction to whether I thought that was
positive or negative?
I don't know if that would be helpful or not for the audience.
Maybe not.
And also, would having watched Crocodile Dundee live during a live watch event, would that
have helped anyone in this discussion?
That's a good idea.
I'm going to take over again.
I will have a discussion. I will say the thing about mate first.
And then we're going to talking. I'm taking over. Yeah, I'm taking over.
And then Andrew will do precisely what Jason just said, right?
That took a minute 14 to get there. Jason.
There we go. That was great. That was not planned at all.
No, no, no, no. I felt an impulse. I'm like, no, I have to rectify this. Okay.
So he felled an impulse.
So I want to make that clear.
The feld is a foot. Anyway.
All right.
So we get feet jokes. Okay.
That's right. Okay. So Andrew, in answer to the question that I initially shut down,
now taking over, I would say that the word mate, yeah, right. As you've suggested,
is multifaceted. Okay. So the word mate is generally thought of or intended,
I think, as a term of endearment. You would just plop it on the end, maybe,
you know, use it to address someone you like, maybe even a stranger. It kind of builds that
bridge between people, a bit of a sign of affection or general public understanding. But
with the right inflection or tone, or maybe even being elongated at the end of the sentence,
it can be used in a more, I would say, sarcastic or acerbic manner. Is that fair?
Yep. So you could go steady on mate, as I just said to Jason earlier, obviously facetiously,
but you could say that as hold your horses or take a step back or put someone in their place.
Now, there's also the more complicated aspect of when it's appropriate to use mate, because for
example, I would equate being called mate in a retail or service situation as being somewhat like
being called buddy. I don't like it. People just going, hey, mate, it's like, well,
You know, we're just having a conversation here. I don't know yet. I'm not sure. I'm not sure, mate.
Yeah, I'm not going to be aggressive or really outwardly annoyed about it. And I would actually
say buddies worse when someone calls me buddy. I think, do I look nine years old? Have I walked
in here with the helicopter hat on my head? Right? Don't call me buddy. Yeah, but that's my choice.
And then maybe then you can infer that buddy is okay. Anyway, I'm going on a buddy tangent now.
Now with this negativity that I've quickly plunged into about the word mate, I will tell you that I actually never use the word.
Really?
I don't.
I have never wanted to use the word mate seriously in my life.
It's always been ironically or to.
If you could just return your passport to the passport office in your capital city.
I'm not sure that's how, you know, citizenship works, mate.
Come on.
Steady on, mate.
Jeez.
Right.
Wow.
I'm not doing it to be a smartass or to make a point.
It's just I think people who listen to this podcast long enough kind of gathered that I speak.
Not intentionally formally but within a way that's a bit too verbose.
So it doesn't really fit my style.
I just don't say it naturally.
Do you have like a different go-to chap?
I think it's chap I think we're going with chat.
Yeah.
No, the thing that I tend to do and I think this is actually what Natasha makes fun of me a lot for is precisely what I just did is using people's names.
So if I learn someone's name, then I will use it and I will even use it like Natasha makes a joke that I will say Natasha when calling out to her and she responds as if there's no one else in the house other than an infant who can't understand you.
Why are you addressing me by name?
So she responds with, "Yes, Martin."
The fact that you remember people's names is also somewhat un-Australian,
because that's the whole...
One of the purposes of mate is the catch-all.
And I can't remember what your name is, but good on you, mate.
Really good to see you, mate.
How you doing?
You having a good day?
Excellent.
All right, mate.
Well, I'll be off then.
See you later.
You've avoided saying your name because you don't know what it is.
Do you know what I love about this?
Because I'm so extreme in my non-use of mate, Andrew had intended to be somewhat critical
of the word mate, but has now gone into defense mode to defend against the extremist.
But let me, so let me go the other side. There is a way that you can use mate that is not jovial
and nice. When somebody does something wrong that creates some sort of damage,
he can then become your mate, but not in the mate that you want to be. Mate, what on earth have you
done? You have effed this up mate and you are gonna have to fix it. Oh that's
exactly word-for-word what he said to the pool guy a couple weeks ago I bet.
He was just reliving the pool guy right there I know it. That's totally what he
said. I cannot believe this has happened mate. You are an absolute muppet. Mate I
I am not happy.
You didn't sound happy that was good that sounded good I hope you can sort of get the gist of that one.
There is Martin's as Martin said then there's the other my hate.
My hate.
What's that one what it would it would it would we do that's when somebody's for maybe they've done what do you do come on I've done something stupid or they said something slightly inappropriate that you kind of think is funny but you can't really acknowledge.
You say "mate" come on you can't do that. Okay. Mate. Wow so versatile. It's a great it is a
great word. What do you think the American equivalent is Jason? I was trying to actually
think of that I feel like it's the thing I like about mate is that I assume it's pretty
non-gendered it's just kind of a general word for people it doesn't matter. It is inherently
blokey, but women do use it. So it can be for anyone.
Okay. Interesting. The closest thing I could think of would be like, dude,
because you could kind of say that about a hundred different ways to mean a hundred different things.
And so it's similar in those respects, but obviously clearly meant as a male thing.
But I don't think there's really a truly universal one that comes to mind that has
Has the versatility of being able to be mad angry sad happy funny all as one but.
So buddy in America because I think mate as we made it in a friendly sense to me buddy is the American equivalent.
Buddy to me if somebody actually said buddy I would be like.
Dude what are you doing come on very condescending like isn't really.
I find it very condescending when people say thanks buddy it's like I say it sometimes I just think of like like.
Like preppy boy wearing a sweater on his yacht kind of thing like really.
I think it depends on who's saying it to him because just about every time I've ever received it it's been from an older male.
And it's used almost in a sense of you're younger than me and I'm reminding you of that buddy.
If it's to someone who's on the same status level or similar age then I think it's less of an issue.
I don't think you hear a lot of buddy I don't think that's really too much of a thing.
That reminds me of a word that used to be in common common usage here amongst the older set towards younger women and that would be love.
And that is pretty much gone by the wayside now, but there was a whole generation where you know, they sort of in a shop and getting served by a female shop assistant.
Thanks love.
Good on you.
I know that you should have coffee thrown in your face and that that now and to the point where now if I hear I am now a bit like.
Now see our listeners at home are going to hear a Muppet outside whippersnapping next to my window while we're podcasting.
I don't know if it's a man or a woman, but I would go outside and say, "Mate, you know what you're doing."
Mate.
What's a whipper?
Stop.
What's a whippersnapping?
You would call it, is it something thwacker or, it was on TV the other day, an American said it.
Weed whacker?
Weed whacker, that's it.
Oh, wow, I would not have guessed that.
Whippersnapper, I love it.
That's a good one.
Putting that in my back pocket.
I think they heard me because it's gone down a bit.
One thing like you suggested Jason, Andrew is going to say the word mate in the way that he chooses,
and Jason's going to guess or infer what the meaning or intention was.
Ooh, this is fun. It's like reverse unannounced trivia corner.
Okay, mate.
I feel like you're going to ask me a question like where a library book is.
That's pretty good. That's pretty good. I'm happy with that.
Mate.
Oh, I just did something real bad. I just put creamer in your coffee that you didn't
want to be there. But you said it somewhat under your breath, but it was still audible
enough for me to hear it, so I knew that I did wrong.
Very good. Very good. Very good.
So we're in somewhat of a hostile situation, and you see someone that is not covered from
a projectile and you're telling them to quick come over here and hide behind this barricade.
He's very good at this man. Yeah I think he's almost more Australian than you at this point.
I've been I've been studying. Mate.
Well the key here is that I'm not actually Australian I'm plotting the overthrow of the
nation I already gave that into this very segment. When it actually happens everyone
can point back to this episode in history. Episode 51 is when it all happened. It was
all there for everyone to see. Or hear. Wait, do it again.
Might.
It's very aggressive. There was teeth. There was teeth involved there. I didn't like it.
I felt like you were probably getting close to physical harm.
Yeah, yeah
Okay, let's see if I can do one more I mean I have to do this in a sentence
I'm just gonna go for him say yeah
Mate, I am NOT your mate. All right
Okay, so this guy
Rear-ended you
You get out of the car fully not at fault
He says to you
Look, man. I'm sorry and you say that as a
double reversal on him of
Don't even think about that. We're gonna try to split this 50/50. This is square on you, buddy
You're paying up license and insurance, please
That pretty close
My goodness Jason, but you are welcome in Australia anytime. Am I though? Actually, are you guys open yet?
Thank you guys might still be closed
And the first thing you need to do when you step off the plane and I ask you to step over here and take a rat test
You can say my come on
I'll say listen here, buddy
They'll put me back on the plane and send me back oh
That was mate corner
listeners would be familiar with my constant nostalgic moments on the show, you two as well.
And I mentioned a couple of episodes ago, I think it was actually in 2022, yeah, it was pretty
recently that I was doing a digital cleanup and finding things to throw out and, you know, just
trying to tidy up a little bit. And one thing that I've found which I haven't thrown out and I keep
out of great sentimentality is what is called the Casio AV100. Are either of you two familiar with
this? It's either a calculator or a media player. Yeah, I'm going to guess calculator. Maybe a
scientific calculator. Okay, unfortunately it isn't a calculator. Jason was closer with media
player. I'm going to include a picture in the show notes and listeners will also find a video
on our Hemispheric Views YouTube channel in the nostalgia playlist once this episode has gone up.
It is a portable LCD television with built-in radio.
Okay, nice. With the big telescopic antenna.
Yes. Oh, listen to that in the microphone. Oh, that's some telescopic antenna ridge right there.
Wow. Communicating with aliens as we record. Now, the reason that I bring this up is because
beyond the normal nostalgic November or nostalgic kind of corner stuff that we would do.
My grandfather, my late grandfather, Peter, this is my mum's dad, gave this to me when I was a kid
and I think it's from like the mid-90s and I could never throw this out and I was thinking
of actually using it as a radio again because, you know, analogue TV signals aren't a thing anymore.
But I wanted to bring it up because it's an example of something that other than being a radio,
Right? Which is still kind of useful.
Yeah.
It doesn't perform its key purpose or killer feature anymore. And yet I keep it around.
And I wanted to know if either of you keep things around nostalgically that actually
don't work anymore, whether they're broken or the technology is now made obsolete.
Do either of you have something that you keep around, which is essentially a paperweight?
So is that by its key feature, do you mean the TV bit doesn't work anymore?
Is that because it's analog TV or because the device is actually broken?
It actually still functions but the TV thing doesn't work anymore because of those signals.
You can turn it on and it has this charming little jingle and the radio still works but
the TV thing, nothing is received anymore. So do either of you have something like this
where you go, "I love this thing but it's a shame that it's been surpassed"?
I just pulled one off my shelf. That is a Pentium 3 processor.
And that's actually like a, it's like its own device. We're going to include a picture of this
too for everyone. Yeah, it is. It is huge. Well, the processor itself, graphics card standards
today, it's quite small. Yeah. This is actually, this was, this was marketing is what happened
here. So the Pentium 3 is actually very small and then they decided to put all
this extra crap around it to make it like these little hologram stickers to
make it look like it's this big amazing thing but it's really just a tiny chip
in there but I keep this around it's completely paperweight it's good for
literally nothing but it's just it was interesting in the sense that I love
that they went to such effort to make it look so cool,
especially back when computers didn't have LED lights,
they didn't have windows in the sense of a physical
piece of glass on the side like they do now,
where the whole point is to look inside the PC
and see all the lights and the colors
and the water cooling and all that.
This went in a beige ugly box and was shut
and you never saw it, but they went through
all this effort to make it look so cool.
So I keep it literally, yes, as a paperweight.
And that is cool because, you know, we're all Apple fans here.
Most people just think that's just a Steve Jobs thing,
that only he wanted the components inside to look really good,
even though consumers wouldn't see it.
And I suppose he was the most extreme in that.
But what you're showing is Intel did the same thing.
Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
There's definitely quite a few examples of that through history of making the internals,
Going above and beyond to make the internals that nobody will ever see actually look good
I'm not good for
Keeping stuff. I tend to I
Either either I throw it out, you know, you know fit of
Purging or Hannah makes me throw it out because she said this thing doesn't work anymore. Why are you even keeping it?
So I tend to keep things just long enough for them to say I'll keep them for as long as they're not interesting
Because they're still quite new and I throw them out and then a year later after they're gone
They would have been really interesting to still have
If you know what I mean, like I think back of all my old computers and stuff is off
I mean I had them now that would be amazing and so much fun
But I don't so the closest I have like in terms of tech stuff would probably be I still have an iPod
And those sorts of things
But most of the stuff has been turfed out. I just threw out an old Apple TV the other day, right?
Because yeah, I could keep it, but why? So I chucked it.
What I do have, I haven't used it as much anymore,
but it was used for the longest time.
And I have it right here in front of me.
Let me tell you what this is and see if you can guess what it is.
It's a Canon LS-80.
Canon LS-80.
Canon LS-80.
Is it a flash module?
A flash module?
Like the sort of like a detachable flash thing.
Oh, no, I'm talking to Canon camera.
Oh, that's a clever idea.
Yeah, it could be a little for like luminance.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a good guess.
It's not it.
Yeah, I was thinking camera related to but I don't think they had
any cameras that were model LS.
Okay, shall I rub it?
It's printer.
Wish I still have one of those two.
Is it a scanner?
No, I had a Canon flatbed scanner.
That would be another thing a SCSI one that would have been another good thing to have kept but no I'm gonna tell you guys
This is the LS 80
electronic calculator
Complete with solar power. Oh, it's so yellow. Yeah, it's it's yellow the plastic
Still turns on
Let's test it
Let's do
73
73 plus
24 24 minus 9 that's 9. Yep divided by 2. Yeah, I don't know does it do Bim das?
I don't know. Let's find out
This is reverse Polish and Polish notation, correct? So make sure we answer according to the Canon LS 80 is 44
Huh?
It's got to be right. So and those buttons are still just as satisfying to to use as ever
So they go you just reminded me of something that I'm gonna go and get from the other room talks talk amongst yourselves
We're doing a podcast here, but see you in a sec.
All right.
Keep talking.
It has a memory function.
I've never found memory functions in Calculator.
It's very intuitive.
I feel like the memory function would rely on you to also remember what the hell you
put into the memory slot.
And we know that's not happening.
So what's the point?
Because you go, "Oh, was it 20?
What did I put?
Ah, clear.
Clear all.
Start over."
And you push clear once, twice, three times.
- You just jam a bunch of times.
- 50 times you hit clear and then also the like all clear.
'Cause you're like, wait, I forget.
Do I have to do one of the,
just hit them both a bunch of times.
- And then this one also has a button.
It has the clear and clear all.
And then another yellow button is, is RMCM.
Now is that remove memory, clear memory?
So why?
- Gotta be.
- So you gotta jam that.
You just gotta smash that a bunch of times too, right?
- So basically your whole top row,
just kind of in the whole thing.
Yep, I love this calculator.
How many digits does it hold on the screen?
Let me see.
Does it go up to like six, eight?
Let me just see if I can type boobless.
But it only goes to like six.
It's eight.
Eight.
Yeah.
Did you used to do the boobless thing?
I recall it happening, but I thought that was on the,
the like the big fancy calculators. Cause they could fit.
You would just type, yeah.
And you'd type the number and then hold it upside down and point.
Yeah. There was like four or five words you could do. I feel like.
Yeah.
I was judged heavily in high school maths, in high school maths class,
because I and another person in the class did not subscribe to using
the default or preferred option of the Casio calculator.
we had sharp calculators.
So our high school teacher begrudgingly came over
to translate whatever he was doing
into the different language.
But I think he would have hated it me even more
had I brought this.
- A Claris calculator.
- It's a Claris calculator.
Claris as in spin-off subsidiary thing of Apple.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Wow.
What is that screen?
- This was in my parents' study drawer.
Is it just gigantic numbers or is that multiple rows?
How does that look?
There'll be a picture of that too.
In the show.
Does it do what goes on that screen?
Yeah.
Let's have a look.
I'm going to turn it on and I'm going to do.
It's calculated.
It's been waiting to be turned on for years.
Oh, they're just gigantic, gigantic letters that spell boobless.
But I thought it was going to be like really fancy with multiple rows.
Yeah.
It looked that way.
Didn't that?
Nope.
Just a regular calculator with half the screen that doesn't get used.
Well, there's calculator corner.
I'm going to keep this Canon.
I'm going to keep this Canon out my desk.
I'm going to be one of those old people.
You know, the old people who sit in front of computers all day, but whenever they
have to do math, they don't use Excel or the calculator or launch bar or anything.
They use that calculator.
That's going to be me.
It's like, I have some important notes to take.
I'm going to stick some post-its to the monitor.
Well, how else do you remember your password?
I wanted to say to our listeners that beyond Nostalgic November and any other things we've
asked them to send before, I would love them to send in, whether it's on the Discord or
@hemisphericpod or hemisphericviewsonmicro.blog, whatever, send us in a picture or description
or tweet or whatever of something that you keep around that doesn't work anymore, either
because it's broken or it's been superseded, but you can't part with it.
I'd love to see it.
Or just a picture of your crappy calculator that you have.
That works too.
You know this is always Mr Feld giving our listeners homework.
It's never me or Jason giving homework, it's always Mr Feld.
Now listeners, what you have to do...
- Go to another place.
- Try doing a podcast with this guy, people.
- You're still here.
[Music]
Media Corner
Well, it's a show that I think all three of us have watched. I don't know if we're all at the same stage because I've only watched the first episode, so we'll try to keep it spoiler free if we can.
if we can for everyone.
- Oh man, this thing, we're chomping at the bit
to get more of this.
It comes out on Fridays and we watched the last one
Thursday night and we're already like,
where the heck is the next one?
- So you've watched three?
- Yeah.
- I've watched two.
So we're all at different stages.
- I've watched one because I held off and said to Natasha,
I've already seen it, but I need to drag you along with me
if you're willing to watch it.
And she watched it graciously.
I said, I don't want to force you,
but it's something that I'm going to be watching and we're either together or not on this."
And she went, "Okay, that was a good show." I was hesitant at first. Well, wait, hold on.
We didn't actually say what it was. We're talking about Smigadoon. No, we're not talking about that.
We're talking about the new, I think it's, yeah, it's, well, obviously it's new. It's not all out
yet the new Apple TV plus show called severance with that one guy from Parks
and Rec who looks totally different I think that's what he was from yeah it is
he's a Parks and Rec guy yeah and stepbrothers I don't know that neither
do I no worries move on so that guy is in it so that's helpful to everyone and
then a few other folks as well probably famous people that people are yelling at
me for not knowing but... Patricia Arquette and directed by Ben Stiller.
There you go those those folks yeah. And what's his name? But Martin hasn't got
to him yet so I'm not gonna mention him. Hmm no spoilers. Oh, Walken. We're not gonna
spoil or anything unless we already did but there are chapter markers so on the
off chance that we do screw this up and spoil something maybe just skip ahead.
Okay well I'll speak generally about the premise and why people should watch this
How about that? Oh, that would be good. Yeah. So if you're unfamiliar with severance on Apple
severance on Apple TV plus, the general idea is that there is this company called
Lumen, right? Lumen Industries. And there is a severed floor where people essentially have a
split between their working life and their personal life. Now, I won't give too much away
about how this works but the idea is hypothetically in our own current day there is a way to actually
physically separate your memories between work and home life.
They call that a work-life balance.
Yeah, work-life balance. Exactly. They even sell it that way.
But it's this kind of dystopian feel to it. And what's really cool about the show,
either of you jump in if you agree or disagree, is that
It's very measured in the way that it's shot. It hangs on these long tense shots of moving through
very satirised versions of modern day open plan offices. Music comes in really thoughtfully
and you really feel the weight of this unbelievably ethical controversial decision
that these people who work on this floor have made to sever memories between two aspects of
their lives. So I found the concept gripping from the beginning and I'm keen to watch more of it.
What do you two reckon?
Yeah, the cinematography is amazing. I love it. It's so good. Every shot is just,
it feels wonderful.
The opening shot of the show is just, wow, what's going on?
The color scheme, just the colors and the saturation levels at different times are
very well planned and you can tell there was a lot of thought put into that.
It reminds me of-
The symbology.
Can I interrupt there and just that it reminds me of a combination of Kubrick and who's the guy who does the
Darjeeling limited Darjeeling unlimited.
Wes Anderson.
Wes Anderson. It's a combination of Kubrick's minimalism with Wes Anderson like perfection and alignment.
Sorry.
It's okay.
No, no, that's great.
I am in no way like a film person.
Neither am I.
So anything you add is great because I'm just going to say it looked pretty.
But one thing that stands out to me is the way that they use symbology throughout the
show without smashing you over the head with it.
Like happens a lot of times we were like, and I'm going to use just a generic example,
not related to the show, but it's like, you know, yeah, we get it.
that's bad is red. And it's like, okay, like, stop, stop just writing on the screen, basically
what we're supposed to think and feel, but just sprinkling it in subtly, but not too
subtly that you are the person that's like, Oh, I didn't see that. What, what is everyone
talking about? So it does that really well in terms of where it places those kinds of
things.
I totally agree. You reminded me of a particular example that stood out when I was watching
even the way that they characterize the corporation
when they're working in the office.
So they have those retro style computers
that do have graphical user interfaces.
So they've very purposely put these very institutional
looking things in there,
but also made them kind of approachable.
And even the top, I don't know if you two noticed,
but in that very first episode,
when you see them using the computers,
I won't ruin for viewers what they're doing
or what's happening,
But you see even the typeface and the way that things are designed and they navigate the computer,
it looks like a very friendly sans-serif typeface,
but everything has this clinical, almost menacing, faceless corporate look to it.
And everyone feels, seems kind of happy in there, but there's this overhanging dread.
It's like it can't decide, almost like the split of the brain, whether it's this positive space or menacing prison.
It's very confused.
I want that computer so bad.
Like you were talking about things that you could have on your desk that don't work.
I want that thing.
I want that prop so bad.
Is it actually a computer that or is it a custom thing for the show?
Did you, either of you recognize that?
I think it's custom.
I'm sure if you looked on the internet, there's been, you know, 74 trillion words written about how that thing was constructed.
If it's not just the off the shelf thing, but it looks so freaking cool.
Yeah.
I love everything about it.
It's so thoughtful. Everything in here feels like it was very deliberately thought out.
It's the first show in a while where I'm like, give me more.
And I'm almost happy that they do the weekly release thing instead of the, you know, here's all however many of them.
I'm really enjoying it. I'm enjoying it on the two levels. I'm enjoying it from the design and the look that you guys have talked about. And also some of the, sort of the subtext and the commentaries that it's making.
The Lumen Corporation, first of all, the thing that this reminds me of is, do you remember Lost?
The TV show Lost.
Yes.
It is like the Dharma Initiative, yeah. Everything is branded.
But it's mysterious about what this thing actually does or how they get their claws in everywhere. But everything is branded Lumen Corp.
You know, they make everything from the pens and the pencils to the medical implants.
You know, like it's just, they do everything.
It feels very Aperture Science in terms of it's everything is weird and nobody really knows what it is but here's your Aperture Science coffee mug and like here's your pen.
And the revered founder the big head.
Yeah and I know you two aren't Blade Runner fans but even like Tyrell Corp and I think the beauty of that is that you can have a fictitious organization that represents all the evils you want to say but without targeting an actual real world company.
And like the little things again with the design like the topography of the office, each room has a name associated with it and it's in like a Futura kind of, no it's not Futura, it is a Futuristic font, I don't know what it is.
Almost like Bank Gothic I reckon.
Yeah, I'm not sure but a font nerd will know.
It looks really nice and it's the kind of office that I would love to work in.
If I had to go to the office every day, that environment would be epic.
Yeah, the carpet, it's all clean, everything's precisely light.
You don't technically know that you don't go to that office every day.
Well, this is true.
And that brings me to my next point.
Getting to the characters of these people, at first I didn't really think about it, but
then I was like, "Hang on, these characters, the people in the office, they never leave.
They never have the...
So they finish their day, they...
Spoiler alert.
Oh, it's hard.
They finish their day, they get in the elevator, and the next thing they know, they're coming
out of the elevator.
I didn't twig to that immediately, even though it's obvious in what they're trying to do.
hard to conceptualize at first it was for me this loop that they're in that's
where the visual design is very clever because when they when they enter the
environment the camera actually shifts it actually changes look so it's a very
artful way of saying same person it feels like it almost goes from like a
like a 24 millimeter lens to like a 12 millimeter lens but with the same the
same focal distance from the subject does this weird shift thing subtly but.
And then the question I want to ask you guys is, is there any sort of social commentary about us in our modern worlds who we constantly bring work home like you used to have the Dolly Parton nine to five right.
What a way to make a living.
God I want some cinnamon bread.
Exactly. So, you know, you would go to work, you do your work and you would leave. And
that was the end of the work day, right? And now in our current society, we're all working
from home, we've got our smartphones, we're looking at work emails, you know, all times
of the day. And is this almost a social commentary on that, our current existence of this sort
of expectation that you're always at work?
I think yes, and also the social commentary on not trusting your employees.
It feels a little bit of that too, where if you're not here and we're not watching everything
you do, you're not working.
It's an obsession with the control of data to the point that it's even the data in your
own mind.
But the other thing that I took from this as a social commentary is the fact that, and
this goes for any sphere of life, any social context you're in, but particularly in this
case work and home. We're all technically different people at work. We're technically
different people on this podcast. The people listening to us right now are hearing a different
version presented through Zoom windows in a chat which is eventually edited and a different
persona. So the person I am at home in the kitchen when I'm cooking dinner each night
is different from the person I am when I'm in a physical office or in a team's meeting for work
or with you guys. So it's like the visceral or embodied representation of the identities that
that we assume in different parts of our lives.
- Sometimes you watch shows and they just feel like
they're more important than others.
You just get a feeling of,
oh, I need to really focus on,
I'm gonna put my phone down.
I'm not watching this and doing something else.
This is worthy of my time and attention completely.
And it's really valuable.
That's sort of how this show feels to me.
- Yeah, we've watched every episode at night
and every single night we've watched this,
I've had like wild, weird dreams, not related to the show or anything.
Just like it clearly got things going in my brain that were like, just,
we're going to, we're going to work and churn on this all night.
Everybody complains about Apple TV or Apple doing media, but tell you what,
it's working.
And look, I'll have watched more obviously by the time this episode goes out.
And I don't know how many thumbs Andrew's going to give it,
but just from the beginning it gets five Martin feet.
-Woof. -Whoa.
-Woof.
-That's a lot.
-Do you care to match that with some thumbs, Andrew?
-I'm going to give it probably four thumbs.
I'm holding a thumb in reserve because I'm still worried this could go, it could become,
my biggest fear is it becomes drawn out and they kind of, they hold back too much.
And it becomes frustrating. I'm worried about that.
Four thumbs. Four thumbs and five feet.
Jason, have you got a rating? You haven't really ever disclosed your rating scale.
I'm gonna go with... How about... We'll go with eyeballs.
Makes sense for TV.
I'm gonna give it a good eight eyeballs for sure. And with a couple of hopes and dreams.
I think that's... I think that's a wrap.
It is. So, count us down. OnePrimePlus.com. It's in the mom game.
