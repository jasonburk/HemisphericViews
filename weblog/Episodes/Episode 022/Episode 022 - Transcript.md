[Music]
Jason, I think we need to give some context for the performance review because Andrew and I don't really know what you've prepared here
and I'm quite impressed that there's some structure, because coming into it I wouldn't have planned any structure.
In any major enterprise such as this, you have employees such as we do.
And those employees deserve to know how they're doing as the progression of the business happens,
right? So we now have been employed under the umbrella of Hemispheric Views for six months,
21 days, 14 hours. So I do believe it's time for the six-month review.
Yes.
So I've put together a little informal/formal, as noted by the spreadsheet, to kind of give you guys a little bit of feedback on how you've been doing over the last six months, 21 days, and 14 hours.
A couple of highlights from overall.
We're on episode 22, if anyone isn't keeping count.
22 episodes in six months, not too bad.
Very consistent, every other week,
haven't missed an episode.
- That is good.
- In fact, there's been bonus episodes.
So a little bit of bonus points for you there.
We've offended at least 14 brands throughout this journey,
which I think is pretty respectable.
It's not quite one per episode, but we can get there.
Five stars in Apple Podcasts.
Five.
- Really?
- That's a lot of stars, at least in the US.
I have no way of checking other stores, so.
- That's each of us voting for ourselves, isn't it?
Is that how we've gotten the stars?
- I hope so.
I think so, yeah.
But it's fair.
I mean, I started to get warnings saying,
"You need to stop, Martin.
"We recognize your Apple ID."
(laughing)
- So other than creating new Apple IDs,
I think we're maxed out on stars right now,
unless someone wants to generously leave us
a five-star review.
You don't even have to put words in.
You can just click the five stars and walk away.
It's that easy.
- It could be gibberish.
- Could be, I'm fine with that.
We've got the Australian best podcast list.
Okay, we're in there.
So that should tell you something.
We've got not only a sticker shop, but a t-shirt shop
of which both are floating around in the world,
not just on my person.
That's pretty spectacular, I'd say, for six months, 21 days, 14 hours.
If you'd told me six months ago we'd have t-shirts and stickers I would never have believed
you.
I would not either, and I'll do you one better, I would not have believed people would actually
purchase them and place them on their hard-earned items/bodies.
I didn't even know that we offered baby onesies, but apparently we do, so.
The store is justâ€¦ it's something.
And I'll also say that we have a sticker giveaway going on that I think as of this coming out
on the 11th, you have four days left.
So get on that.
Check out the blog, tells you what to do.
It's very easy.
Pretty much just do anything mentioning one of us and you're entered.
So get on that.
Now performance review time.
Are you ready?
Not really.
like I do it in pre-performance review where basically I'm sweating bullets.
I've been aching for this.
The best part about this one is usually you do these with a manager,
kind of in a one-on-one situation, right? In a closed room. This is wide open on the podcast
for everyone to hear and you're both get to, you get to go through it together. So I guess I'll flip
a coin. Let me find a coin. I don't have a coin. I have a sticker. I'm going to flip a sticker
because that's what you would do. Let's see heads will go Andrew first, tails will go Martin first.
What did I say? I'll have to listen back. I think I said heads was...
Heads was me. Yeah. All right. Are you ready? You feeling good? Did you throw it? Did you throw
heads? I did. Yeah. Oh no. Yeah. We're representing our hemisphere here, Andrew. We're wearing it.
I'm really nervous.
No, it's going to be fine.
It's going to be fine.
So you'll get a copy of this afterward, obviously, to sign and return.
For those that don't know, I am the head of HR, and that's why I'm performing these reviews.
So Andrew.
Yes, sir.
Canyon.
Department.
Spreadsheets.
Title, CFO.
Time and service, we've gone over that at least six times now.
My department is spreadsheets?
Yes.
That's just my entire department.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah
So he broke the performance reviews into what do we got one two, three, four five six seven eight nine ten
categories
job knowledge
attendance
Enthusiasm
your hemisphere
Your attitude your work relations. Very important your cyber security
Your unannounced trivia corner. Oh god your communication and your name. Oh die. Okay
So we'll just go through each one fairly quickly, this is highly scientific job knowledge
Gave you a good
You're going places. Keep it up. Okay. Thanks. I don't even know what the scale is yet. This is brilliant
Attendance I like this it's being
for people listening I'm
Gradually being this has been gradually being revealed to me as he's doing this slide down a colored block
Oh an opaque block to reveal my scores
It's almost like the old the old overhead projector style when you don't want
The class to see the entire slide very nostalgic the other bit of paper on top
I've been working with you guys six months 21 days 14 hours
I know you're just gonna look right ahead to the end and not really take in the solid information
I'm trying to provide to you. Okay
attendance
Excellent. You've been on every single show. So good job. Hey, you got it. You got to show up
That's what I was always taught. That's the good but turn up
Enthusiasm
Good going with a good your comments. There are just simply all caps. Oh mfg exclamation point
So good job there hemisphere. You got an excellent. You are in the correct hemisphere. So keep that up
Yes, that bodes well for you, Martin. Thank goodness attitude
excellent
Overall good except when you yell at everyone. So stop that. Can I ask a quick question about that one?
I'm curious about the dual rating of excellent and overall good. Are you are you questioning the
Performance review process because we haven't done yours yet
It feels like we may need to edit
yours
After this. Oh, yeah. Yeah your attitude. You're trying to take away my excellent score. That's what he's doing
It's trying to boost up the comment. I
Don't care about the comment. Nobody reads coins all about the writing
It's so true. That's why we wanted five stars and any words of there are meaningless
Work relations you got an excellent you seem to get along with everyone unless they use default apps
So that's sensible and appropriate cyber security. You got a good everything looks to be in order
But your Wi-Fi password is a little bit weak. So I would look into maybe upping your game there a little bit
He's got a point. He's actually got a point. Okay
See now he's questioning internally. He's like does he actually know what my Wi-Fi password is? Surely he doesn't but really it really is
not that good. Unannounced trivia corner, ooh, fair. You got a fair here. You're going
to really need to step it up in that area if you expect to move and progress throughout
your career here. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I just, it's honesty. You know, you have to
be honest with your employees.
I was going to do better there.
Probody's nerfed.
Communication, good. You know how to use iMessage and Discord. So that's about all there is
to say there. And then your final category is your name. Excellent. Your
name is indeed Andrew. So you did good there. I'd say overall you did fairly
well for your first performance review having no indication that this was
happening or would be reported on. Can I just say that I'm shocked. I thought his
name was Andy. Oh. Don't even. Oh. What was that category? Work relations.
We might need to edit that.
So how do you feel after your first review?
Do I keep a job? Because that'll influence my feelings overall.
Fair question. Yeah. Well much like unannounced trivia corner, you don't actually get to know how this ends.
Oh.
It just sort of happens and you hope for the best and next time you show up you hope that the door opens.
They've changed the security code. My FOB doesn't work anymore.
Yep, exactly.
Ejected from the discord. Yeah overall. I'm comfortable with that. I'm a little bit disappointed in the trivia corner
Obviously, that's my lowest score
We all are and I'm always looking on the class half-empty kind of guys
So where did I fail not all the good things that I did?
well, so it's something to work on but I
Think for six months in the job. I'm still learning and I like to think that I will get better
And I look forward to my annual performance review and perhaps even a pay rise or a pay
Assessment attached to that or or just pay in general would be good probably
Well, that is true because as much as I'm the CFO you seem to be the one
receiving all the revenue
We're here to talk about you guys right now, not me. So we're gonna move on to the next review
I'm ready and look given how things have been going the last six months 21 days and 14 hours with the new Feld foot
You can only get better really? Yeah, it's a lot worse actually
So we have Martin, obviously, Department, Internet Marketing.
That's a new thing.
Yeah.
And his title is SVP.
Very official.
Same time in service.
Let's go.
Job knowledge.
First category.
Excellent.
You know your stuff.
Good job.
Attendance.
No surprise.
Excellent.
You too have been on every single show.
So keep that up.
Enthusiasm.
What's this going to win?
Here we go.
Excellent.
Wow.
Coming out of the gate strong.
Hemisphere.
I mean, surely.
Excellent.
You are in the Southern Hemisphere.
Well done.
That's a relief.
Attitude.
He's doing really well so far.
What do we think attitude's going to be?
He's doing, so far, he's 100%ing this thing.
So he's staying very quiet.
Typical Feld.
Attitude.
Excellent.
Excellent. It's not easy being a dictator. We get it. Well done.
All right. Can I just ask about the word dictator here? Do you feel like I might have been dictating
to both of you? I'm very surprised by this. Work relations.
Moving on. Fair. Oh, there is this whole felled foot thing
to be considered. So that might be an area to think about work. Not that I'm trying to
tell you what to do. I would never do that under the foot. But consider it.
I mean I have two feet so one of them isn't crushing you. I just want you to know that
I could go much much worse. It could just be all out stomping.
Let's see what's the rating below fair. Maybe I should change that actually.
Poor. Give him a poor.
security. Ooh, fair. Your Wi-Fi is terrifying. I'm just gonna say that. It scares me every
time. That's all I think about most days is your, what I would barely even call internet
connectivity.
Yeah, that's right. And that's why I'm the internet marketer.
Right. It makes sense. Unannounced trivia corner. Poor. Hmm. It started off so strong.
So strong. It's just not going well now.
You notice the comment, you got to read the comment there because you've gone full Australian.
Oh, come on, mate.
Oh, now I understand.
Poor.
Thank you for clarifying.
Yeah, sorry. I should have, I didn't have the right, right language in there. Sorry.
Communication. Good. You have iMessage, you have Discord.
Here's a bit of interactivity. How can I improve? Mr. Rightjob.
not really what these performance reviews are about. So you're gonna want
to talk to a different department about that. Spreadsheets perhaps, sure. Yeah and
your name ending strong, your name is Martin. Excellent. Thank you for
confirming it. But it's Lord Martin I believe. Oh. I wasn't gonna push it I
thought my work relations might have been bumped down a notch. Careful. Very
good. Well I have to say I'm impressed with this very very detailed and
Structured matrix Jason. I didn't expect any less really. Thank you both for being
employees who don't get paid and
Are subject to abuse via
Performance reviews fantastic and in return head of HR
I thought I'd give you a very very quick performance review and a very stereotypically unstructured manner from the internet marketing department
oh boy, I have Andrews all right with this too because
Well, you know, he likes spreadsheets and I don't really do that. You do the qualitative. I'll do the quantitative
Correct. Well done exactly. So look I'm not gonna review Andrew because Jason's already done that
I'm just gonna move straight to Jason and I want to say positive essentially all-round. I'm not gonna be following these categories
I want to commend you on a number of things that I think that you've shown great ability and
Enthusiasm and just all-round spirit Jason
First of all, I think we owe you a great debt of gratitude and commendation for your show notes
Listeners at home who are enjoying the Hemispheric views experience. You are getting essentially top-class
Best in the category number one links and show notes. Jason is a very very thorough
Contributor if you can link it
He's linked it and he's probably linked it twice and then written about it without a link telling you where to go to find those
links. He's all over it, all right? No mucking around. This feels too real. I'm very nervous now.
They're high class show notes. There's no denying it.
It's very, very good. Next I want to talk about the shops, or the stores. Sometimes they're called
shops, sometimes they're called stores. I don't know if that's accidental or intentional, but
it respects both hemispheres, so fantastic. Stickers, shirts, really, I mean, Andrew provides
the financial bedrock, the spreadsheeting that facilitates this fantastic business,
if you want to call it a business, I'm not sure what this is, we'll call it a business.
But Jason, your enthusiasm, your willingness to expand the hemispheric news universe commercially
is very commendable. And I want to thank you for that. The final thing that I want to talk about,
and this is not so much of an intentional thing, necessarily, but I want to commend you on your
fantastic ability to pick up and run with Australian vernacular. And we saw it
in the Hemispheric View's HR review just then. We saw the word "mate" which is a
genuine example of Australian slang. And look, you've come across some very, very
strange expressions. Sometimes we've pulled them out, you know, just willy
nilly, as I just did then. Sometimes I do it with a degree of malice and spite
because I know that it's going to trip you up and you're gonna fall silent. And
And Andrew's gonna know what it means.
And we're gonna have our little private hemispheric club here.
And then I know that it's going to come back around to bite me because the Feldfood is
going to get a poor review when it comes to work relations.
But you know what, I don't care because you're doing a great job and you've picked up the
vernacular.
So I commend you, Jason.
And the last thing just to maybe frustrate Andrew in this qualitative world that I'm
suggesting is that I want you to set a goal for the year.
And I don't want it to be smart.
And when I say smart, I refer to the capitalized acronym.
I want it to be as dreamlike or unrealistic or aspirational as you want.
And maybe in a year from now we'll come back and revisit that goal to see whether you've
met it.
And you know what?
If you don't, I won't care.
What's your goal for the year, Jason?
Before he answers, I just want to make a note that I will care if you don't.
I know you will.
So think carefully, Jason.
When you said smart goal, my whole body just cringed.
why I said. I just remember doing those so many times and just thinking there's
nothing less smart than this right now. Well this time I'm permitting you to be
SMRT. SMRT, yes. My goal is to have eight products for sale, one of which is not
stickers and or t shirts. And when you say this, you're referring to the hemispheric
muse commercial universe? That is correct. Fantastic. Well, thank you, Jason, for your
not so smart goal. And we may revisit it in the future. Andrew, I just I don't want to
leave you out here because I think it's time for a lot of back padding. Andrew, I want
to thank you for tolerating the grammar Nazi and spreadsheet avoider, who is me and just
being, you know, all-around great guy from Western Australia. You bring a lot.
Aw, thanks mate. I appreciate that. I feel really valued after that, because I was starting
to feel a little bit crushed after Jason's review. I got a fear rating.
Now those Northerners tend to be pretty rough. Rougher than the Feldfoot, I hear, in some
instances. To be fair, you didn't get the worst rating,
which is automatic termination. Oh god.
So... You're not doing too bad. Well, I didn't do any performance reviews.
Because I didn't really think about it, but I just want to say you guys tops love it
Thanks so much
Jason you wrote a really interesting piece on your site
About Amazon or rather escaping the Amazon and just to be clear you weren't talking about the tropical rainforest
Not this time. No, this was actually just Amazon the I
I would say store, but really it's so much more than that.
The, uh, be, oh God, I don't, conglomerate.
I don't know what you even call a company like this that just
make it cool up owns everything.
Yeah, I did.
And it was a little bit of a weird.
Thing to write.
I won't, I'm not going to reread it here.
You can, I'll link it.
Obviously the biggest thing is it really came down to, where do I even begin?
It was a very tough piece to write, which sounds weird, because I didn't want it to
come off like an attack.
It's not a "I'm doing this, therefore you should too."
It was really more of a personal realization that I came to that Amazon, which started
as just a place to buy things, kind of became a weird, almost addiction in a way, where
instead of actually acquiring a thing and having any kind of care or admiration for that thing,
it was just more about like clicking the button to get the thing here and it comes in a day and
then it's here and then kind of who cares move on to the next thing. And that just, I don't know,
I just don't like the feeling of that. And then the number of boxes and little bags and crap that
comes to the house that you have to somehow get rid of that may or may not
be recyclable probably isn't as we've seen with almost everything in the world
and I just wasn't feeling good about it anymore and I didn't really think I
wanted to be making my monetary contribution to helping them do what
they do not to mention all of the just downright shady things that they do I
don't know if you saw recently but there's a this is not the first time
There's a company called Peak Design that makes like camera stuff like camera bags and little accessories and stuff.
And Amazon has their Amazon Basics brand and just the number of times where they blatantly
cookie cutter copied another product from another company and just started selling it for a
third of the price, half the price, a quarter of the price, whatever it is.
That should... and with no no recourse because it's Amazon. What are you gonna do?
Did you see the video that Peak Designs made in response?
I did, yeah.
And it was great.
That was a...
I can very much feel the message coming through of them just like being absolutely pissed,
but feeling trapped and not knowing what to do.
So it's like, we might as well make the best of a bad situation.
And I think that was great.
But yeah, that just...
It's not the first time and it won't be the last time.
So I don't know, I went through and I figured out, "Hey, what does Amazon even own that
I use?"
a heck of a lot because they buy everything like all these companies. So I
went through and just kind of listed out everything that they do and figured out
how I get rid of it. I think I'm done now actually. It took me, it didn't take me
very long. Once I decided this was a thing it was like full steam ahead and
now I've basically checked everything off the list. But I've been an Amazon
user since 2002. Wow. That's crazy. I don't know of another service that's
really been that long and I've had Prime since 2010. I don't know if Andrew relates
to this but when I saw your list right I just thought wow okay the the American
stereotypes are true that Amazon owns everything and it owns you it just owns
you as a person really it seems yeah but like Andrew what do you reckon I say
this is an Australian I think okay I understand so many websites that I use
are probably running on Amazon Web Services in some way and yes Prime
videos come here and I've maybe heard of people who use Audible but Amazon as a
website to buy things wasn't even really available in Australia until a couple of
years ago so it was always this far-off thing we've always been much more
dominated I suppose by things like supermarkets and banks okay do you agree
with that yeah and I think here Amazon hasn't had that footprint you're right
It's launched it finally launched its Australian store a couple of years ago and it landed with a fizzle
Like everything that they were selling which wasn't much
Was overpriced
You could get it cheaper everywhere else there, you know sort of quick delivery service wasn't quick
It was just a bit of a dud launch
Wow, and that really got them off on a poor footing because people have been waiting for it for so long
It arrived and it was a bit pathetic. It has gotten better now
Although I still feel that we haven't been trained as Australians to go straight to Amazon yet
I think a lot of people do their online shopping and we're more
We'll go to storefronts. So brands will go to a particular brand
That we know and then buy there whereas Amazon is kind of like the catch-all marketplace
Will go straight to the manufacturer or the the primary retailer
Yeah, right. That's my impression of it. Anyway, here they're there prevalence here is really one of my biggest fears, especially given
Everything that's happened pandemic wise
everything that's small is closing because they can't afford to not be open and
yet then we're gonna end up with nothing but Amazon left because they have a billion billion billion dollars and
and can just weather the storm. And then we come out the other end with only Amazon and that just
that seems terrible. So Amazon essentially kills or reshapes what you think about as a bookshop,
right starting off and then they end up opening their own physical stores. People may or may not
be serving you and there might be automated I'm not sure but there's a physical bookshop
and I've seen posts floating around on websites like let's say LinkedIn for example where you
kind of see a similar thing in Australia happening with major supermarkets like Kohl's and it always
kind of annoys me a little bit when they act like they've invented something new that really
never existed before. And I remember this example where all of these people from Coles
were saying, Oh my goodness, we've launched this new version of Coles and it's like a
little neighborhood supermarket and you can go in there and get specialist goods quickly.
And you know, if you need that deli meat really quickly for that sandwich that you want, you
just waltz in and look, it's right there in the fridge. And there's someone with a kind
of trendy hipster alternative uniform version of the cul-de-fit that you know and hate and
they're going to help you.
And I thought, so you mean that all those years that you were crushing those little
delicatessens and those grocery shops and stuff, you've just now essentially rebirthed
the very thing that you dominated and destroyed.
And I just find that really, really aggravating.
This sort of return to the human which they crushed.
I kind of came to the decision finally that I need to do a better job of supporting
the people that really need it and not just, you know, throwing more money into Rocket Boy's pocket.
"Oh, no, he can't be Rocket." Well, see, that's the other problem.
There used to be only one Rocket Boy that I could call Rocket Boy and now there's multiple and that just...
It doesn't seem like this is going into a good direction as much as people want to believe that
everything they're doing is altruistic and they're gonna really...
I don't know. I don't buy it. I am definitely cynical and skeptical about this kind of stuff
But you can't tell me that you see these people that are obviously just wanting to be billionaires
That are really doing that much to do anything beyond their own walls
it's kind of like like I think about Bill Gates right and a lot's been said negative about him and
Fairly enough because he was an intense business person. But then yeah ruthless. Thank you
That's the word but now he's in his next act and basically he's trying to give away all his money
In a sense and you know put it to better use
Which I think is quite admirable and are we gonna see that from Bezos? He bought the Washington Post
I don't know. That's not on your or maybe that's not Amazon. That's Bezos, isn't it?
So it doesn't keep your list Jason, but is this gonna be something similar from him?
I mean, it's I think it's too early to tell and who really knows what's going on in their minds, but I don't personally have a
strong indication that there's a lot of
Altruism going on there, but but the the feeling
Coming through the company that is directly
Controlled by you doesn't feel great and as unfair or fair as that is
That's reality
If you're gonna run a company then everything that company does is on you with the replacements that you found
Have they been have they been as good have you lost anything? Um, that's a good question. I would say
We found some real gems in terms of replacements
So for instance grocery stores, we found great ones that are local that are I would say better just because they have actual
Local goods in them the Kindle and audible were interesting just going through the the loopholes of removing DRM
Something I haven't had to deal with in a long time
back to when that was a whole music thing when we had to figure out how to
Rip our mp3s or but you need to burn them to a CD and then rip them back off to get the non DRM ones
That was always fun
But it's all doable, which is great. And then other than that, no, nothing like super
Eye-opening just the fact that there are alternatives is it's good. That was my one fears
I was gonna charge out on this and then be like, oh shit. There's nothing else and then I did order one thing yesterday and
The shipping was like it was free shipping still so that was not an issue
but I think the timing was like 12 days or something and it just felt like I
I had to catch myself from falling off my chair. It was like 12 days
Welcome to Australia. Yeah
Then I remembered anything I send to you guys takes like eight weeks. So 12 days is still pretty good. It goes through quarantine
That's why needs to be checked for any harmful bugs or nasties that could you know ruin the Australian outback
You're just afraid we might send through something that's not a murderous bug and/or insect. It's true. We don't do harmless
That's not a thing.
Yeah, listeners, make sure you check out the comprehensive list of the show notes that
Jason's provided.
And look, just before we move on, I want to leave a slightly amusing parting thought about
this.
I don't know if you've seen this, Andrew, being in Australia as well.
I don't really watch free to air TV, but other than ABC and SBS, no real ads generally.
But whenever I've been over at Relatives Place and they do have it on, I see TV ads for eBay.
I hear they're an up and coming company that is doing online sales.
So that gives you an impression in this country Jason that eBay would advertise on TV as a competitor to something like Amazon.
[Music]
Media Corner.
It's time for Media Corner.
Now Andrew, we've just heard something pretty special.
What the hell is it?
I've got to give a big shout out thank you to my nephew, Alex Canyon.
You can find him at alexcanyon.com.
Link will be in the show notes because Jason will get that sorted.
Alex is a muso, a voiceover guy.
He's quite famous, famous I guess you would say, in the progressive rock scene.
It's not really a scene that I'm
Tied into but he I know he's sponsored by a guitar company
Now I always think of the guitar company being mayonnaise, but it's not mayonnaise. I think it's like
May may something like mayonnaise people who know guitars will know what I'm talking about. Sounds delicious
His band is called Voyager
He also does some other stuff. He took it upon himself
To do I asked him he didn't take it entirely by himself
Thanks
He accepted he accepted the opportunity to be a part of this prestigious show
I said Alex we need a media corner theme that ties in with our existing sort of tunes that we've got
But it's a bit authoritative that tells you this is media corner. This is what we're at
This is important stuff and I for one think you nailed the brief
Thank you, Alex. It's great to have
Contributors helping our little show get better. Thank you Alex
Now just imagine him at a gig
Playing a show wearing a Southern Hemisphere t-shirt
He would I mean that would just be just just hang it up. That's like pinnacle of career right there
That's a good point holding his mayonnaise guitar. Yeah. Yeah, he's huge in Germany and I'm not sure what our German
Step num download numbers are like but I was good psyched if that's what they are. We are also huge in Germany
Thank you to Martin for that. So there could be a good crossover. What do you think? Yeah, let's get him a t-shirt
Or a sticker on the mayonnaise guitar. It's a good idea people love stickers on their guitars. Surely
Don't see why not or at least on the guitar case. I mean, that's a classic music move, right?
Yeah, you kind of just position it up on the stage in such a way that everyone can see it
Yeah, I love are we cool enough to be prog rock compatible?
I don't know he sounds like that that description of him sounds cooler than anything that I've ever done in my life
True true, but maybe he could just do it in sort of an ironic way where it's like hey look
here's a show with old people on it and
And yeah, it'd be that kind of thing.
It does suck.
He's 11 years younger than me and he's way cooler and probably has been since he was
about 17 and I was 27 or 28 easily.
And he was just like, cool.
Has he ever done a hair flick?
Like a genuine hair flick?
Oh, he, he used to have the really long hair.
Right.
And he, you know, he was, he's a bass guitarist, so he had the long hair and he
could just bass face it with the hair going all over the place.
Now he's got no hair.
He's a nude nut.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Oh, a nude nut.
Wow.
I love that.
Escalated.
But, uh, he still pulls it off.
The guy still looks cool.
Of course he does.
It's not fair.
That's the pinnacle of coolness when you can hair flick with no hair.
I know.
So yeah, he's, he's a good dude.
So, um, and he's really helped us out.
So that's enough about the theme.
Let's get into media corner.
Does anybody got anything or do we just play the tune and we actually don't have
This week the Media Corner is the theme. I can kick us off. Go ahead Martin.
Alright. This isn't anything new in my book but it was something that I was
reminded of through other media so bear with me as I go through this process. So
I'm gonna mention first of all but this isn't the Media Corner pick. I've been
watching the second season of For All Mankind which I think is absolutely
fantastic. No spoilers I don't know if you two are watching it but. Haven't seen
it. Thoroughly enjoying the show on Apple TV+. It's on my watch list I haven't got
I've watched season one, haven't watched season two yet.
Okay well there's a half media corner pick for you but one of the actors in it, Michael Dorman,
who plays the character Gordo, really really good, he plays a great sort of vulnerable
character, guy who sort of needs to improve and he knows it. I've been looking at him throughout
the episodes thinking "you look really familiar, where do I know you from?" but at the same time
he seems completely unknown. So then I did the little thing where you go down to related and
and where the cast and crew and all them, you know, they're all listed there.
And I saw Michael Dorman and I clicked on it.
Now, Andrew, do you remember a show called The Secret Life of Us?
Yes. He was in it.
He's actually from New Zealand and he played like this cool
dude with blonde hair.
Now, I was a bit too young to actually watch that show,
but I thought you might remember it.
But that's not my pick.
That then reminded me of Samuel Johnson.
You know, the actor Samuel Johnson.
Yeah, Pulp Fiction.
That's who I thought too.
Well you might remember him, Andrew, maybe this whole thing is falling over, from the
movie Crackerjack with Mick Molloy, which is my actual Media Corner pick, particularly
for people of the Northern Hemisphere who need a dose of Australian vernacular and culture.
Andrew, you're nodding.
You agree?
Yeah, I know the movie.
I still can't place that actor, but I can certainly place the movie.
Yeah, you might recall Jason that I mentioned a show called Barjass a while ago.
Well this has a number of Barjassians in it, such as Mick Malloy, Judith Lucey, people
who lent their voices to that classic dubbed comedy parody spin-off whatever it is.
Now Crackerjack is a movie that sounds like it shouldn't work, but it does.
And it's all about a bowls club with a bunch of old people and a completely uncouth, not
quite Bogan but verging on Bogan guy played by the Australian actor Mick Malloy, and he
becomes their only hope to save the bowls club. This is a movie that sums up so much of what is
quirky and kind of irreverent and whatever about Australian culture and it even works in some
pretty bizarre cricket bowling references which I'm sure Andrew appreciates like the flipper
played to the classical piece Zadok the priest. So if you haven't heard of Crackerjack I'd strongly
Recommend it and I think that's the Aussie media corner pick of the week. Wow, you have just topped all of your other
media quarter
introductions and just that was
Amazing. They had so many twists and turns and oh, I can't wait. That's my brain to watch. Yeah, I'm to my brain
Andrew yeah, I've got one. I'm actually gonna good luck topping that I'm not going after that
I'm doubling down on the Australian media corner.
Okay.
So there is a, I think it's four episodes.
It's on our service called Stan here in Australia.
I have no idea if it's available anywhere else, but it's called after the night.
And it's a recounting of a series of murders that happened in my hometown,
Perth in the 1960s by a guy called Edgar Allan Cook
Right. Yeah
That's right, isn't it? Let me check that. I just always think of Edgar Allan Poe
Consulting the Australian Internet right now. Yeah, hold on. Hold on cuz I don't want to get this wrong Andrew
Do you need me to press that button that makes things work in Perth? No. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hang on
You guys have to switch right? There's like a little button at a point at a point
You can't see me, but I'm peddling at the moment
Okay, it was um, Eric Edgar cook. Sorry. Oh so close so close
Eric it cook so Perth was a sleepy old town and
You had no fears about anything particularly in the particular leafy suburbs in which the murders and things took place
All of a sudden it was Perth was thrust into
The world of a bigger city where crime happened people got killed
Police tried to do a job that they were ill-equipped to do it really did change the culture of Perth
Now so it's a really interesting one. I enjoyed watching it because I've always heard about this this story
These happenings it's fun as well to see your own hometown
Reflected and that's something we rarely get being from Perth very rare that you see your own place on any
Media if you live in New York, you see it all the time if you live in LA you see it all the time
If you live in Perth, it's a very rare thing to see your town
Represented and it's really interesting as well. They tell the story
Well, some of the people they interview like I know because they're
Personalities you say personalities. I know a lisp. I know. I'm sorry back up back up back up back up
Was that a?
Perth
Personality as in a Perth personality. Yes, and is that a thing in Perth or is this something you've just come up with now?
No, that's a that's just a well-known thing
So that he doesn't persist with that one
Everybody uses that here and everybody knows everybody in Perth basically, that's the other thing
There's only about two and a half degrees of separation from anybody
So you can't really ever get away with anything because people will find out trick for the except you murdered these people
Yeah, well they eventually got there but in the process they did lock up a few innocents, but you know
That's that's what makes the story
Yeah, that's right the cops are looking for an easy out fascinating show after the night
It may even have a different name overseas the morning so check that
because of the hemispheres yeah exactly it doesn't work out, but I
Really strongly encourage you to watch it. It's only four episodes. It's got a really cool
Theme song as well not as cool as this to the point where I watched I watched the opening credits each time
Just for the song and then I went so far as to find it and get it. So
Yeah, now it's his Nokia
Ringtone, that's right. That's right
So not yeah, so yeah get it watch it, but I didn't explain it as well as Martin explained his crackerjack
No, no, it's good. I'm curious just to see it. So I know who the personalities are
I wonder if you pick any of them. You'll surely know one or two of them. Well, look, I mean Sydney and Wollongong
They don't always turn up a lot unless it's Australian TV
But I know how you feel in Perth because according to Australian media your entire half of the country doesn't even exist
Exactly. So good on you. I'm still questioning it
But I have to believe you until I can put boots on the ground and find out for myself
Well watch this show. Maybe you won't need to come to Perth. You'll get all the information you need. You do have a
Spot in the time zone clock. So
That's something that's true. You do show up there. We share it with Taipei, I think but yeah
But if I type Perth it actually comes up it doesn't make me pick something that's close enough
Someone just persuaded them to add the city
You do know as well that Perth Perth is perfect
Do we do that one?
So, how do we go about putting edit points in again? How do we that's my job this time write those down
No, you're gonna leave them all in I'm gonna move on to my media corner now
Which is not an Australian film slash series. I
Did music this week the band name is
Graveyard Club and the album in question is
Good night paradise. I believe it's on all of the standard
Music listening things saying that as someone who only uses one of them. So it's not the one I use
It may even be on Amazon music, but I don't know. Yeah, it's just like it's a cool
I don't even know how I would describe it
This is one of those ones where I feel like as soon as you listen through the first track
You're gonna know if it's for you or not
It's not I know it's called graveyard club, but it's not like I don't know
It's not like death metal or something like that. It's it's uh, it's no cradle of filth
Apparently it's new wave. I don't even know what that means. I think maybe I I'm not enough of a muso to understand what that is
Entailing but check it out. Did you get back to the 80s? Ah, this is from 2019. So I don't know. Yeah, check it out
It's a graveyard club. Good night paradise
Link in the notes
It's all I got I don't have a I don't have a big fancy
Perth murder show. Sorry
That'll have to be a follow-up item
I think so we can determine exactly when you this music came from because if new wave was new in the 80s
Am I right Andrew? Is that right? New wave was in the 80s?
Yeah, is this a newer wave or is this an entirely different wave? How many waves are there? Waves are continuous
They are but if the if there's a big wave watch out for the bigger one behind it. Oh
Oh, oh, so this is the bigger new wave after the initial new wave. I think so. I think so. It's the newer wave
Newer wave. Yeah, that is a good ring to it. That's really easy to say.
Oh God, that's all I got
While you think of that I have a totally unrelated question for both of you, which has just popped into my head
I've spoken about Vegemite a bunch of times
Natasha hates it. She thinks it's
Repulsive she hates the smell something that she hates just as much if not more as a snack that I enjoy
quite a bit and I've been very excited to discover a new brand and that is
The Martin Feld approved jar of pickles in the fridge. Are you two pickle people?
I would consider myself a pickle person
So when you say you're a pickle person you go to the fridge you open the jar and you submerge your hand in the brine
And remove the pickle for straight consumption. Yeah. Yeah, I'll do that
See Natasha hates pickles and ages ago. She said that it was like a kind of pregnancy snack
I'm not you know, it's not something that you just go and eat. So are you a pickle person Andrew? No pickles suck
Hmm why that's a very very hey, look I just changed my headphones and I still can't hear myself
So there's something definitely wrong with my settings somewhere
So this whole show this whole show if this if I sound terrible this whole show
It's because I haven't been able to hear myself. So I've had this kind of muffled sound
I've been really self-conscious about it. You guys are gonna have to stay with me because the only way I can test this is um
Communication can't do this alone
So pickles turn in to the the Perth murder mystery thing already
This is you're staying here whether you like it or not. I don't like pickles Martin. He's gone, but I don't like pickles
Pickles are pickles are good
Although I did have fried pickles at a restaurant the other night and they were nice
But they were not as good as American fried pickles that we'd had at a place in
Where was it it was somewhere where
Some of the head, Florida probably no, no. No, it was it was sort of in the south. So hang on
I need to get research on this. I'm also not surprised. You think something fried was good here Martin's gone
I'm gonna go to because I'm gonna find out the source of these pickles. Hold on
I'm gonna I'm just gonna hang out here by myself is important. Yeah
Yeah, just here everyone's left
Okay. Well, I'm gonna oh here comes the first jar of pickles. I literally am
Here's the situation. I am sitting in an office in the United States on the West Coast at 5:30 a.m
Two Australian gentlemen have left the room to acquire a jar of pickles from the refrigerator
Respectively sometime around midnight and 9 p.m
them. That is where we're at now. And now we've got pickle number one from the east
coast of Australia. And now pickle number two. Oh, pickle number two doesn't seem to
be here. We may have an issue.
Andrew doesn't like pickles.
I have some pickle intelligence.
He
You have pickle intelligence?
So we've got the Jo... something...
Gurkentopf.
I think it's a German brand, I can't quite read it.
It looked like it was German.
Maybe a German pickle.
Surprise surprise.
Ooh, there's the crunch.
That was a good crunch.
Pickle juice is exploding in my mouth right now.
Yeah.
That's what the people are here for.
We got pickles in Lexington, Virginia.
Okay.
I have a bad feeling that Lexington, Virginia may have been a site of a civil uprising in
the last few years.
So we were there before that happened.
We were there before that.
And there was this restaurant, you went up, it was like an old, old, we would call it
a pub here in Australia, but I don't know, maybe you call it a saloon.
I don't know.
Only if we're wearing spurs.
But you went upstairs and there was this sort of old style restaurant and they sold the
best deep fried pickles ever.
So if you live in Lexington, Virginia, it's a pretty old town.
There's lots of, I wonder if the statues of all the Confederate people are still there.
Don't know.
But I hope the restaurant's there because that was good.
Was there actually any pickle in the fried stuff or was it one of those things where
It's a fried pickle, but it's pretty much just breading. No, no, it was a giant pickle. It was a big pickle. Okay
Yeah, it was really nice and I'm saying that as somebody who doesn't even like pickles
I don't remember how we started talking about pickles. How did that even happen? I brought them up
No idea if it's actually gonna go on the show, but I really just wanted a midnight snack. So just
It's for the show I have to eat the pickles
Okay, that's fair.
