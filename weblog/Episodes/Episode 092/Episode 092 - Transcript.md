[Music]
We're all a bit flummoxed because we've got a new way of doing our show notes.
Not show notes.
Not show notes.
Not show notes.
What are we called?
Runsheet.
Topic pool.
It's the HV runsheet in the newest and hottest app.
It's a we have given up craft for this episode will it last I don't know we're running in free form.
I'm saying no.
Martin has already put the foot down that was fun while lasted.
No no no more because I did I ruin it did I ruin the fun or did I take fun too far what was it.
It was so much fun that it wrapped around past not fun but then came back around to fun again.
You did like the full circle of fun.
I thought I'd get in the full spirit of freeform.
Freeform suddenly turned into Trafalgar Square.
We had pigeons everywhere.
Absolute swarm of pigeons.
At extremely high resolution.
6,000 pixels wide.
My M1 MacBook Air struggled to zoom in and out because of all the pigeon photos.
So that made it difficult, but the pigeons have been eliminated.
And now we have got a show notes all lined up humanely I will add they were removed humanely they were yes yeah.
Yeah I threw them in the trash this is this is it apparent this is episode 092 featuring 32% more Martin.
Is that just because it's a flat rule for all episodes now because I was a white no no no let's not get carried away this is strictly a one episode deal.
Okay, right no future rights or you know implied or expressed
One episode only 32% more and we're gonna hold you to that
Great. Well starting my talking more from right now because I can see you've had a little note. I assume Jason
It's a foot that says says a lot of things
Yeah
I just thought it was really fun to throw all of your topics
Immediately into the corporate style parking lot that you added to the freeform board because you know that's funny and originally I had
Camrys only just to make fun of Andrew, but then I thought you know what Rivians - let's chuck them in
So should we visit the parking lot first just so we can be nice that seems to be important stuff
I mean, it's it's we're still well within your 32%
So I'm gonna have to say you get to make the call all right well
I think when you arrive somewhere traditionally at least if you've driven by car
You would arrive at said parking lot or car park.
So let's treat it not as the place for later.
Let's treat it as the arrival.
Okay, we're in the parking lot.
Cameras and ribbons have been parked.
I'm allowing you to explore the parking lot.
Okay, what's first?
Okay.
Well, there's a lot.
What do you think?
You want to go first, Andrew?
You want me to go first?
Who's get?
You're just bustling with excitement.
Like, look, you're just bursting.
I want to go first.
I want to go first.
This is me.
Who's going to get out of their car first?
Is it you?
Okay, look, I don't want to bury the lead on this.
So I'm going to jump straight into the hot topic of the parking lot.
Okay.
When you finish hanging your washing on the washing line outside, do you take
your pegs off the line and put them in a little basket or do you leave your
pegs on the line ready to be deployed?
Next time.
Is there a more perfect first topic for the show than that?
I don't know.
It just seems so perfect.
Well, I feel like I have a strong thought on this, but then I don't actually care.
So it's something that's obviously just been instilled as a habit from my family back at
home.
I'm a basket guy.
I feel like you collect them and put them in the basket rather than leaving them out,
but it probably doesn't really matter.
They're not going to go flying off if they're securely attached.
And I feel like the basket, I've always had that little moment of not panic, but slight
anxiety reaching into the basket thinking what spider is waiting for me
absolutely but then that's ridiculous because why would a spider be hanging
out in pegs it's not where it lives they don't have no interest in that they're
always interested in everything you're in Australia mate okay so you're a
basket guy but the basket stays so the basket is hanging from one of the
clotheslines and the basket just is out there 24/7 hmm okay correct assuming
that you have one that's of high quality or is actually still attached because if
it's flimsy and falling off, then, well, that's a broken mask.
Okay. Okay. Jason?
Yeah. I love this question because I had no idea what it meant when it was in the little
post-it note. So this is great. Now I have some context.
Do you have clothes hangers? Do you have the heels hoist?
No. So spoiler, no, we do not. So that's why I was a little bit confused by this question
So it's like pegs on a line and I'm assuming that meant like a clothes line, but no we don't
We don't have that here. How do you try your clothes in a clothes dryer? Your jacket is now dry
That's what they have. Ah, like an appliance. Yeah every single load
Washer and dryer. Yeah. Well certain certain things don't go in the dryer. They just get hung up in
Said laundry room to to air dry by themselves is nothing in your got there's no line in your garden no no really.
That's so Americans do not use wind like the natural phenomenon is not a thing wind and sun are pretty new here is not notice by our use of fossil fuels that we're not quite like into wind and sun quite like we're still trying to figure that out but I think it's very dependent on where you are in the country this is a very.
Region specific type of situation in terms of of using the the clothesline i think you'll see those probably more so in the midwest.
I would say then then but there's no reason i couldn't have one here also we just don't.
The people they have a lot of windows that we went yeah we got we got our fair share of wind.
This is fascinating you literally so this is going in a direction i didn't anticipate in that you do not have a clothesline.
We do not have a clothesline.
Wow.
So you go and dig up some coal, get the fire going, dryers connected.
It's just this.
Well, first, first we first we kill the dinosaurs, then we bury them, wait for them to turn in to the correct fuel type, dig them back up, process them, burn them, dry our clothes.
Job done.
Wow.
Okay.
In the Perth in the Perth summertime you can hang a you can hang your clothes on the line come back 15 minutes. They're dry
There's no mucking around. It's quicker than a dryer
But that's for me pegs are
pigs
You must take your peg off the line
There is absolutely no
Efficiency dividend from leaving them on the line
Because if the next if you leave them all strung up pegged on the line the next time you go to hang clothes
You're not saving yourself effort by having to be like, the peg won't be in the right
spot and it'll actually get in the way.
So it's actually more annoying when you're trying to hang your next bit of clothing on
the line.
You're still having to remove the peg and then replace the peg where it needs to be.
So there's absolutely no efficiency dividend.
You shouldn't do it.
You should put it in a basket, remove the peg, remove the cloth, peg in the basket.
Also, if you've got pegs on the line, if you have a slightly misaligned line or it's a
bit saggy, you'll find, and if the pegs are made of a certain style, they will all slide.
They'll all slide down to one end or the other or halfway in the middle, they'll clump up.
That's no good either.
Same problem as before, but you've just got a clump of pegs to deal with.
I ask you about your pegging preferences in terms of the clippy kind or the slidy kind
or maybe there's a third kind that I am unaware of.
One thing show title pegging preferences.
Yes absolutely.
That's what we're going to make it.
Thank you.
Go on.
That was the hope.
So.
By design.
For the longest time I was a fan of the plastic peg with the slight metal spring just in them
and it had the different notches, different size notches.
So if you had thick clothing or thin clothing,
different line with diameters.
- Two notches in there usually, I think traditionally.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
- You got it?
And those you could just leave out 24/7.
The spring would gradually rust,
the plastic would gradually warp.
Then one day you'd go to squeeze it and it would just snap.
- Yeah.
Can I guess that you call the other ones woodies?
Is that, am I anywhere close?
- Are you talking about the little ones
that have the little circle top
and just two little stalks. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The little tines, yeah.
- Yeah, it looks like you'd eat corn with them.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no, I've never had those in my life.
- Ah, damn it.
- They seem impractical.
- I think you have to have the clothes over the line
for those to work, right?
Like, 'cause there's no force and there's no spring.
So I think you gotta wrap it over the top
and it's just meant to sorta hold it attached to the line.
But I got to imagine then you've got little weird pinch marks in your clothes.
I don't know.
Yeah.
And in the summer in Perth, we get the wind known as the Fremantle Doctor.
That's a heavy wind.
The doctor.
That's just going to blow them right off.
The Fremantle Doctor.
Yeah.
Why is it the, why does your wind have a medical degree?
Because after a hot day, it provides relief.
Just as a doctor might provide relief.
Oh, interesting.
Okay.
Yeah, we have the Newcastle Podiatrist.
That's lesser known though.
Oh, yeah.
It's good for the foot though.
Yeah, it's a low wind.
Yeah, just down below the knees.
Yeah.
Okay, through that arch.
It's excellent.
So my final, my final tip though, in peg corner is your tip in peg
corner in the pegging corner.
Brought to you by Squarespace.
I have a square peg in a round hole as they say. I'm a fan of a stainless steel peg.
Okay, yeah. All right, really good but I put them in the basket but then I bring
the basket inside when I'm done. Keep them fresh. Stainless steel with spring?
Yeah, yeah, they're just metal. They're just metal with a springy bit.
Oh, like a built, like the spring is engineered into the structure? Yes.
Yes that sounds really good.
That sounds costly.
Yeah I don't know how much they cost.
Money is no object when it comes to pegs right?
You gotta take your pegging seriously.
That's true yeah you do it's very delicate work.
Okay.
So.
Listeners do you have a clothesline?
Let us know and do you polish your pegs?
Yeah the people wanna know.
Fun fact, actually, for work, while I was in Adelaide,
we visited a site, which is part of the broader company
I work for, which was like the home of the Hills Hoist.
And they have a gigantic Hills Hoist,
like it's kind of like a big thing in Australia,
but it's not really absorbed or part of that whole thing.
I think people might've wanted to recognise it that way,
but it was cool.
It was like this big Hills Hoist clothesline.
- Did you swing on it?
- I feel like this has come full circle.
I did dance around it like a maypole.
Nice.
But yeah, I couldn't swing on it.
It was too high.
Is that a brand?
Is that or what's the-
It was like the it's when Australians get all, you know, teary about some of their great inventions, like apparently, arguably Wi-Fi and black boxes and stuff, the Hills Hoist is thrown in.
And that's that big silver one with the kind of rotating handle that moves it up and down the central pole.
If you can envisage that.
OK.
Telescopic.
You can raise or lower your entire line.
Wow.
Just by cranking a handle.
Yep.
Arguably better than Wi-Fi, potentially.
And it spins.
It's like a propeller.
Well, if you think about it, you mount your internet service or Wi-Fi modem on top of the Hills Hoist to get better range outside.
And every kid would swing on the Hills Hoist.
I broke one when I was a kid.
You just have to.
All right.
What's next in the parking lot?
Did we already mention that we're using free form now?
Is that already, we already did that.
I think we did that already.
Yeah.
And then I put all my pigeon pictures in here.
One of which actually, cause the viewers, sorry, cause the listeners couldn't see
it, uh, was a woman being attacked by pigeons in Venice, which I found very
enjoyable.
I took that photo.
I would like to, I would like to bring forth the topic that I, I don't think I
have strong feelings on, but I probably will after you both give your, um, take
on it.
There's something in there that says, quote, basketball emoji space.
Should HV, I'm presuming HV is related to this show,
be on something called your tube.
I'm curious what, yeah, I'm curious what that is about.
If one of you could comment.
Basketball off you go.
Okay.
I listened to a show called really specific stories.
Oh yeah.
Another podcast.
Interesting.
Yeah.
It was really good.
Really enjoyable.
True crime, right?
Is that true crime one?
I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Basically.
So there was a guy, there's a guy, you know, the, you know, the, the hot game at
the moment, Baldur's Gate.
Yes.
Yes.
So the guy, he was on it.
He was on it.
Yeah.
And he made a point, a really interesting point about how the multimedia angles of
Podcasting these days whether you have you might have a podcast. I might have a transcript and
You might be on multiple platforms. You might have an RSS feed, but then you might also be on a
on a platform that
allows for monetization or create a content and
Statistical insights such as YouTube. Hmm. Yeah, that's interesting because
Hemispheric views has an RSS feed. We have a blog we have transcripts
We have wonderful show notes
But we're not anywhere other than the RSS and
So I thought bring it to the table. It's part of the board meeting
Should we be exploring?
Having our show on a platform like YouTube not that it would we would do anything special for YouTube
It would literally just be an audio the audio file uploaded to YouTube
It's probably our logo just sitting there for 45 minutes
type 45
Is it?
Type 45 might make for easy sharing if you wanted to you know people that the world the global community is very used to YouTube
It's very integrated into everything it might make it sort of easier to share bits and highlights and find a new audience
Thoughts yeah because to be clear we already have a YouTube channel
We put little clips and stuff there and excerpts but never full episodes and that's what you're wondering if we should do.
Just chuck it up.
Well, Jason, you said you had strong thoughts.
So.
I have like mediocre thoughts about it.
So to be clear, you don't like our current audience and you want a different audience.
Is that what you're saying? Or is that.
I just think the more the merrier.
Like, hey.
Just want more, more additional, not replacement.
No, not replacement. You still get their podcasts wherever podcasts are found.
Yeah. You're a podcast player of choice, obviously.
Yeah. Okay. Let's see. So we've actively chosen not to be in certain places,
like the green one. We're not there.
Yep.
I don't think, well, I don't fully know, but I tried like hell for us to not be on
The yellow one, but I think we are still on that one.
And I'm unsure how that's possible without like explicit consent.
So I'm not sure what's going on there.
You're talking about luminary?
Uh, the Amazon one.
Oh, is that yellow?
Ah.
Whatever color they are.
Um, we've already, you know, actively cut out potential others just due to their
platforms being questionable.
Yeah.
So YouTube is like a different whole different thing though because it's it's it's it's got tube in the name
Which I think implies video, but there's YouTube music, which is weird to me. I
YouTube feels like it's they started to launch their podcast offering in the US. Yeah, like yeah
It's it's like trying to just audio everything for the sake of YouTube
Getting more money because I I don't for any
Brief moment believe they give any amount of about any content that's on there
It's completely about monetizing it and taking their cut. So, okay
so I guess if the if the goal was to just
Get people to see the content. I keep calling it content. That feels gross
to see this show or listen to the show or whatever like
Maybe that's okay. But like at the end of the day, I don't know like is Google any better than Spotify or
Amazon I don't know. I guess it's just sort of a trade-off you have to make in terms of like
Potentially letting people find it, but I also want I don't have any numbers on this, but I wonder
How would you listen to it?
Like you wouldn't use your podcast player of choice. You wouldn't know able to so I guess you would just sort of find it on YouTube
and then
Listen to it in the background or something. I don't know. I I'm I'm very
Under-knowledged in the area of all of this. I'm sure there's some SEO like
Magician that would be like, oh you got to do this this this and this and then you'd be you know
You'd be NPR like okay fine
Not really an opinion one way or the other
I just don't really know like what it would do versus the effort to
Put it on to YouTube because you would have to it still has to be a video
I think hmm. I mean, it's just a still image and use that like little blender app
I guess I forget the name of it the fusion cast fusion cast which is I think that's what that's for right is basically to
Put audio on YouTube creative. So we'd have to do that
But it's one of those things like you don't know until you try so maybe it's like experiment
Start throwing a couple up there. See what it takes to do it and see if anybody cares. I don't know Martin Martin
What do you?
You're you're the you're probably the the well, you know, probably you are the most qualified to speak from a social media
uh, like perspective, I guess, like that's, that's more in your wheelhouse than, than either of us,
I think. I'm probably the absolute worst about it. And Andrew wants to do it and like has ideas of
things to try and you actually do this stuff. So you talking about it probably means more than
anybody, so I'll let you go. All right. Well, thanks. I appreciate that. Although I think you
both know what you're talking about. Um, and Andrew, thanks again for listening to that
show, I thought what Balta had to say, if people haven't listened, he has a background in interactive
media and you can hear all of that stuff that he's studied and researched and done in his work
in that interview. But he made a great point about having things in different places. Now, as I speak,
I have to kind of check my own bias about being someone who loves this particular
podcasting niche that we're in and what that community means and RSS and so forth.
What I like about the RSS element is, I think, what you both like, which is that open element.
You can move the show somewhere else or you can play it at any player. It's purely the audio
with all of the accessible text and transcript and show notes stuff attached to that. Now,
YouTube offers those possibilities for the show notes kind of description stuff in the description,
so you can still have a kind of podcast-esque experience in terms of listening to or watching
the content, as you said Jason, that word's totally fine I think, but it's that centralised
manner which is sort of troubling for people. Now if the audience or our listeners benefit
from that and want it, I'd support it, I'm not entirely against it. I think that the thing that
we didn't particularly like about Spotify, although YouTube you could argue is technically
doing similar things, the thing about Spotify is that you can see that they're essentially trying
to upend and move that audio hub somewhere else into their own area. YouTube would love to do that
too, but the implementation, I think, with the video aspect is a little bit different. It's not
fooling people in the same way maybe that Spotify would. So I'm not so concerned about that if
people would want it or if it offers people a benefit, but there was a word you said there,
Jason, which is more my concern, which was that word "effort". Because you both know the effort
that we put into making this show.
You know, I'm sure people appreciate that,
but people listen to the audio, they go,
"Oh, I enjoyed that," or "I didn't, that was great,"
and then they move on.
But beyond this recording, you know,
you do your show notes, Andrew and I edit the thing.
It's many, many hours of work.
And the benefit of the RSS thing is that
if we spot a mistake or we want to update something
or fix something in the audio, we've got one place,
we do that, and it updates everywhere and it's done.
the moment you start uploading to a different area which is centrally controlled somewhere else,
that's not being updated by that same source material. You've just doubled potentially your
work of having to upload and fix things elsewhere. It might sound like a small occasional thing, but
suddenly it's you've increased your creative workload because someone or something else
wants to control the experience elsewhere. So I think if it's, in summary, a good thing for the
audience, they want it. I think it's cool to explore and listeners can tell us, but I don't
necessarily see huge benefits because I think the people who are generally wanting to listen to us
have that bias towards the very same thing that we do. I hope that all makes sense.
Yeah, absolutely. I kind of, if we were to do it, I see it as like a signpost back to the website or
or the RSS or whatever.
Like I think it could be like a, like a billboard almost
where it's an advertisement, give it, you know,
bad word, but to come back to the thing.
And I'm also now realizing that I do upload everything
to archive.org.
So I'm already screwed us on the single place anyway.
So yeah, I don't know.
I mean, it, again, like it's, there's no reason we couldn't.
- There's no right or wrong.
It's a subjective thing.
- Yeah, like there's a reason we couldn't do a couple
and then just see like, hey, maybe somebody found us
because of that, they didn't.
'Cause on it, like finding podcasts is hard, right?
Like if you're listening to your podcast--
- Discovering is terrible.
- Player of choice, search is not,
unless you're using Apple Podcasts,
which it's only meant to search apparently,
it was not meant to actually listen to anything.
- No, no.
- As we discussed last time, but I mean, maybe it's,
yeah, it's just, it's an ad.
- This is exactly the entire question that I'm wrangling with
with that really specific stories show,
project that's attached to it. And people might listen to this and go, "Oh, here we go. We've got
three white guys using the podcast to talk about podcasting." And yeah, that's true. We do all
kind of go around in circles on this. But if you extrapolate that and think about, "Well,
what does that mean for how we consume television or where we get things or we submit to centralised
stuff for other content, but not for this?" It is a broader question about the effort that we put
into producing something or where people can get access to things that they pay for or subscribe
to or enjoy. So anyone who's listened to this thinking, I don't know, why do we talk about this?
If you put time and effort and money into the things that you consume or produce,
you kind of hope for or expect some freedom in the way that you can move that information around. So
that's what I think is important. At the very least, sharing would be easier
because sharing a podcast is hard. Like you can't really, I mean, you can send them a link, I guess,
But then if I send you a link from pocket casts, it's gonna like go to a pocket cast page and you're like
What the hell is this?
Whereas at least YouTube is like it's universal
Clearly, it's pretty well known. I think it's pretty popular now
But I would say it's pretty safe to say most people know a YouTube. It's now so I don't know maybe yeah, I
would just say
board meeting we need to make a
A year day on on if we do it or not for a free trial period
Let's say of an undetermined amount. Yeah. Yeah, so
Please vote Andrew show show of hands. Yeah, so I mean I'm a yay on the trial
Giving it a go for a couple of episodes two or three episodes and seeing what happens seeing how much work it is
Seeing if it's feasible
Andrew sorry Martin. What's your what's your vote here?
I say let's give it a go see what people think listeners can tell us as well
And maybe we even try throwing this one up as the first one.
All right, majority rules, two out of three.
There you go.
We're going all in on the YouTube.
Well, not all in.
And Jason, was that a no from you?
I just realized that it doesn't really matter what I vote because it's already
two-thirds majority.
Oh, but I'd like to know because I'll be honest, I'm subjectively against it.
And that's kind of the thing that inspired my project.
But I think I've got to keep my mind open as a researcher.
Unless if our board requires unanimous voting.
I don't know if we clarified that in the bylaws.
The Constitution.
Andrew, can you check the bylaws and see if it works?
Yeah, just let me have a look.
I think my, while Andrew's checking the bylaws of our supposed Constitution,
I suppose my request or condition for this would be
RSS is the core of what we do.
So we might do additional things, there might be additional labour,
but I don't think anything should supplant the open original material.
No agreed so I've checked the bylaws looked into Constitution the articles of association.
Turns out that we only need a majority but there's also fine printing this fine print that says Andrew always has the power of veto.
Wow I'm thinking that's probably because I wrote them.
That was gonna say did you I don't think we did we probably didn't even need to sign off on these it sounds like.
No no no I had the power to sign off.
I have no memory of this constitutional fine you had no need to know about it.
Okay did you was it was a new relies on Martin the business filled okay just chill.
Okay I got this chill you telling Martin to chill you know that's completely impossible okay so I will do like I'm relaxed I'm seriously relaxed please understand.
shenanigans for episode 0 9 2 right oh and here's a solution when it comes to
the show notes all you need to do is put a little link that it says for full
show notes and transcript click here yes beautiful yeah I don't imagine you
don't double the work there you go it just all it's anyway I doubt it does do
you think I don't know it doesn't matter it's YouTube we don't care okay meeting
adjourned so drive people to the website thank you Jason needs a gavel.
I really want a gavel now I should get one I'm gonna get one for next time.
Jason can you do the purple can you do the purple note it's gonna say the same
thing yeah I'm excited about this one the one about freeform no no the other
one the other one let me look let me look oh you might be referring to very
important tangentially related to Arcadia June it is August don't worry I
know that it's August I'm fully aware of that Arcadia June happened we've already
talked about it you're not going crazy but a couple of announcements here so
number one Arcadia June winners I have all of your addresses the trophies have
been created and they will be shipped out very soon so you will receive them
guaranteed before Arcadia June 2024.
100% guarantee there.
So that's topic number one.
Topic.
- No spoilers.
Jason showed me and Andrew and we're very impressed.
So I don't think people would be disappointed
by the effort that Jason's put in.
- Massively impressed.
This is like next level.
- Pretty good trophies.
Yeah.
So we've had three, this is the third year.
We've had trophies.
I think we've had trophies all three years.
Ooh, now I'm forgetting.
I don't remember.
I think I did them for the first year.
Right?
I think so.
Questionable.
Anyway, we could ask, you know who we could ask?
Oh, I know who we could ask.
Probably the person that won't be winning 2024 because they're banned.
So good.
Once you win three, like your actions, you're just, you're in the hall of fame.
Yeah.
Hall of fame.
Put the Jersey up on the rafters or whatever.
I don't know.
Whatever it is, that's gonna happen, so good for you.
Okay, topic two, Arcadia June.
We've done three years in a row.
We're gonna do the fourth year, obviously,
but it's gonna be a little different
because our friends over at Arcadia
have created another game, Arcadia Sports.
Yes.
And what game is in there?
Oh, I don't know, a little game called Netball.
Sorry, basketball.
So there's another game now.
And because there's another game,
and we have such a lovely relationship
with the folks over at Arcadia,
we have no less than, I don't know,
like 10 codes or something for Arcadia Sports
once it hits the App Store,
which I'm assuming 'cause we have codes,
it's already out in the App Store.
So we're gonna figure out some little kind of raffle system
to get folks hooked up with Arcadia Sports games
so they can start practicing now for Arcadia June 2024.
So look out for that.
We will post about that and...
- Well, here's a question, sorry,
just to completely throw this.
Arcadia Sports, right?
Separate app from Arcadia.
- Correct. - Yes.
- Does this warrant a separate month for the sports app?
Like another competition?
Or do we bundle them together in the one month?
- That's a great question.
The committee is still in planning phase.
So there's more to come from that.
At this point, we've announced nothing officially other than that there will be
an event in Arcadia, June of 2024.
So more than that.
Unless I veto it.
Correct.
Correct.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But other than that, I don't think I will.
Probably not.
I don't, I mean, you might veto the winner from last year, but other than that, I
think we're, we're go.
Right.
Like I've said everyone calls me the foot but slowly someone's revealing the truth about himself.
I haven't one set of bylaws and it's just all out the window.
I love Arcadia sports codes were gonna create some kind of little contest for that look out for that and we'll get some codes out to you and be great.
Arcadia sports this is so exciting I just want to say because finally.
We don't have to hear about Bricko.
Maybe, we don't know.
We're not sure.
She's committed.
But yeah, well done to Raffaella with Arcadia.
Like what a great thing.
He's lent into the concept of the 8-bit games, built a whole new one, sports, and got us involved as well.
So thank you really fantastic. What's next? Oh, right. Wait a minute. We've been in the parking lot for like an hour
Are we ever gonna get out of the parking lot?
And this is what I mean like you screwed up the form. I'm a very generous soul
I have let you explore the entire car park all levels from
Green one through to purple 23 out here carrying an air conditioner around lost the whole time and I'm still letting you walk around
Can we come in the building yet? It's very hot out here in this parking lot.
The sun is just brutal.
That's up to you. It's where you parked your Rivian.
I'll just go real quick, Jason, then we can move out of the parking lot.
My desk is an absolute disaster zone.
I no longer have access to my, to the studio display.
So all I've got is a Dell monitor and my
MacBook.
Can you give us the spec on that?
No, 20, I think it's 27 inches 4k.
- Is it HDMI?
- It has HDMI display port and my personal preference, USB-C.
- Oh, good.
- But it has no hub functionality
and my MacBook has two USB ports.
So I use one power and then for this show,
I'm having to use one USB plug into my audio interface.
Who which leaves me no ability to plug in a monitor so I am just talk to you guys on my laptop there's I'm using but I can't use my mouse because that's a USB.
I plug I don't know where to plug that in I'm using like the sushi mouse thing from apple which is terrible sushi mouse.
So the magic mouse okay the magic mouse is sushi mouse I've got like.
An adapter plug here like a dongle thing from a macbook which is of no use whatsoever because all it does is.
Push out push the HDMI which goes to try to go to the monitor at a low resolution so that doesn't work 1080 so it's not gonna work.
Every raise of anchor stuff but this is not much help to me it's fine.
It's a much how should get the one martin uses it saved his life last week so i got to solutions this one i have to spend like fifteen thousand dollars on one of those cal digit thing me bob so it would probably solve the problem.
Or the grand return.
The iMac the Intel iMac comes back everything plugs back into it that becomes my studio my podcast studio computer and i go back to that lifestyle and i think that's where i'm leaning.
I don't like it.
Why not feel good about it.
It's got lots of memory. I can plug everything into it. I can clean up my desk. Like if you guys saw this desk, I'll include some photos in the show notes or something. But this desk is an absolute embarrassment. And I've been roasting everybody's desk, you know, sitting in my ivory tower before now. And now my ivory tower has crumbled. This is a disaster zone. I'm embarrassed. I don't know what to do.
So you're on battery right now, is what I'm hearing.
No no cuz I chose to go with power and audio interface no monitor no it's just like this probably why you can see up my nose from the camera.
Got it it looks fine honestly I don't.
I wouldn't have noticed if you had made a big deal of it.
Looks fine.
Not really.
I'm fine.
Okay great let's get out of the parking lot.
Oh we're going to the mall.
Yeah we got a bit of choice here I don't think I'm gonna get through all of it so.
To be clear the rest is just Martin talking right and I can just kick back at this point.
Yeah I'm turning my microphone off.
Okay perfect go ahead Martin.
Alright so rapid fire basically I keep knocking my mouse on the floor it's a bit of an issue I'm worried I'm gonna damage it but I don't know how to get around it the problem is I had my trackpad on the right but I kept getting this weird swelling thing you know in my middle finger which is a bit awkward when you can't move your middle finger and you're just waving to people and you're just
Constantly flipping them the bird so do you have a battery in your finger yeah I do actually lithium ion completely swollen so I had to move it to the left finger issues are gone now because I'm using this lovely.
Logi master thing but yeah because it's higher and I'm used to like skimming across first world problem I keep like completely chopping my mouse.
I've done that Martin I understand I've got that mouse connected to the iMac.
Exactly it's a beautiful mouse I'm not having a go at it but it's like it just goes flying off and it's a bit of a problem.
You should get a sushi mouse you just fly over the top of it.
At least it would be culturally connected to what I'm doing exactly.
You can't go to a low profile,
Hi are you saying it's over the top would just be like a kind of bullet time.
Over the top like a switch to a different side so that's that as you should glide to get like.
Mission control very efficient I just so that's that I could find out that topic I'm moving on now and I just enabled Siri by swishing my mouse.
I will you have a nice chat to Siri Jason's actually asleep I think.
Leaning back next update that little thing about play date obviously play that's all about games still enjoying it when I can don't play this much as I would like to but I think you pronounce this way.
The mp3 player that they added to the catalog fantastic if anyone's looking for like a retro iPod app for their play date to play music.
strongly recommend it because it's essentially, you know, you just get the app, you mount the
playdate on your Mac in like the disc mode, drag things over. And the thing that I love about this,
other than the fact that you can use things like the crank and the D-pad and stuff, is that it
renders everything in that retro kind of black and white finish. And all of your album artwork
does the same thing. So you see this kind of old style version. So I had We, the Arcade Fire
album on there recently, and there's this kind of retro pixelated eyeball. Very cool. One thing
that's a bit annoying is that because you have to kind of have the app running to listen to the music,
you kind of leave it open and then can't do other things. But I mean, really, it's such a particular
thing. Have you used this, Jason? I have. Yeah, it's pretty fun. But yeah, to your point, like,
Like it wouldn't be, it's, I don't know,
maybe novelty is too strong of a word,
but it's not like, this is not your primary way
of listening to music most likely.
It could be, but probably not, but it's still really fun.
- They would have to make some changes to the system or.
- Yeah. - Yeah.
But as a fun way to sit down
and deliberately listen to music,
kind of like the effort you would go to with vinyl
in switching and flipping things.
It's a fun idea.
And I like that they're continuing to be creative
that the developers on there.
- I like that it features a cassette.
- Next thing, 'cause I'm firing through topics.
- I like that it features a cassette tape.
That is super cool.
- Are you looking at it online now?
- Yeah, yeah.
This makes me wanna get a play date.
- It's pretty nifty.
- What does the crank do?
Does that like fast forward and rewind?
- I don't think it does,
although that's a cool idea for an affordance.
There are little instructions
about how you can navigate stuff,
but at the very least it just scrolls
and gives you that nice feel.
- You have to actually crank it for it to play
the whole time.
That would be fun.
Why do they do that?
You can control the speed, that would be great.
Anyway, rapid fire topics,
I'm getting through them all here.
Right, Jason knows about this already,
I don't know if Andrew does.
I did make a toot about it, as they say on Mastodon.
Do they still say that?
- No idea. - I don't know.
But Natasha joined Glass secretly
to see how long I would take to notice.
Right, and she had this whole secret discussion with Jason,
and then Jason ended up, I think,
Did you become a patron so that she could?
- I did, yeah.
- Very generous, 'cause she was like,
"Oh, it's, you know, they're like referral codes
"or something," and you were just like,
"Oh, hell with it, I'll go do this, so thanks for that."
But she cracked up because I think I uploaded a photo,
and as we record the month's kind of category
or highlight is shadow, and I just went to have a look
at the shadow feed, and I went, "I recognize this thing."
It was like a little baby donkey toy that Mac has
that he carries around with him,
I mean, Natasha put it somewhere and took a photo
with this little donut camera.
I'll include a picture in the show notes
or link to her account.
And I was like, I recognize that donkey, tapped on it.
Like, what?
And I told her instantly, I was like, what's going on?
She said, you took less than a day to find me.
It was exactly 22 hours.
And she was just, what the hell?
And I was like, well, you put it in the monthly category
that I'm looking at, but that's what happens.
Anyway, she's one of many people using Glass.
We've spoken about it before,
but I just wanted to say that within one photo,
considering the style that she adopted
and this cool little novelty donut camera
that she's had for longer than she's known me,
she instantly became cooler on that network
than anything that I've ever done.
- 10,000%, yeah, yeah.
- It's like, why do I bother?
- Yeah, it's like the shittest camera
that you can ever imagine.
So, 'cause Glass posts like what the,
what camera it is that the photo was taken with.
And if you look up the name,
I'm blanking on what it is right now,
but it's something where you'd be like,
what is that?
That doesn't even make sense.
But if you look it up,
it's like one of those just sort of like
crap camera systems that you'll put in like
a million different products regardless of what they are,
because it was like the cheapest,
like three megapixel, whatever.
But the majority of them are in like wildlife night cameras
that you put out like to capture like wildlife
in like infrared or whatever.
But it's in this like donut for (beep)
who knows what reason.
And honestly, the photo quality is absolute shit.
And that's like, I mean, that's no fault of any,
like that's what the camera is.
But honestly, the stuff that she's capturing
with the motion and like, I don't know how much like effort
she's, and I'm not trying to like degrade what she's doing,
but like, I don't know how much she's like
taking it seriously or just sort of like snapping pictures,
but like the stuff that she's coming up with
is like artistic AF.
Some of this stuff looks so f*cking cool. And it's like you would spend thousands of dollars on
camera gear and lighting and like after effect sh*t on this. And it's just coming out of this tiny
stupid donut. And that just makes it so magical. I found her username now and I'm looking at them.
There she is. And the camera, I think the actual camera or the sensor, like you were saying Jason,
and it shows up, it comes up as wild game AC3S.
But I think the name of it,
yeah, the name of the actual model,
I might be mispronouncing it,
it's genie, like a genie donut camera,
it might be genie.
- Could be, yeah.
- Anyway, I think she said it before, but I've forgotten.
But I can tell you,
she is not spending ages constructing these situations.
She said to me once, you know,
I busted her or discovered it,
you know, seeing how long she was waiting to see
when I would discover it.
She just started carrying it around.
like when she takes Mac out or something
and just snaps a moment or,
oh, I'll pop it there, that's interesting.
And there's actually one photo,
I think it's the second one on the account
where you kind of see a portion of Mac's face
and the caption is eat in quotation marks.
And that's because whenever he has seen the camera,
he says eat, like he wants to eat it.
He tries to actually reach for it to take a bite
'cause it looks like food.
So yeah, totally in the moment, just carry around.
She is not spending a lot of time
constructing these situations.
- I love it.
That's what makes it cooler.
I think it's so better than anything you've done.
Martin.
It really is.
Definitely.
Oh, 100%.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's brilliant.
It's a great account.
Just follow it.
It's awesome.
There you go.
So anyway, she's way cooler than I am.
Yeah.
Unfollow Martin and follow Natasha instead is basically what I would say.
I wouldn't be offended.
Just go for it.
It's actually making me want to join Glass more than anything else I've ever seen.
How do you draw on the Mac version?
Yeah, alright, cool.
How do you draw a shape?
Oh, like that?
You have to be on an M1.
Are you free-forming, Andrew?
Yeah, I'm trying to, but...
Oh, pencil.
There we go.
Are you ready?
In three...
Oh, no, wait.
I know what you know what he's doing just before you finish Jason you know what he's doing he's taking the full hour to learn free form the same way he did it.
I just put a cross in them as an inspector going to put in the wrong spot so what I can do I'll come on I should just be out of go.
You should get an iPad.
That's moving it.
Get real work done on an iPad.
How do you move it?
Oh boy.
Are we stopping?
How do you select it?
Oh no, it's a post-it note.
Three.
It's used to one note.
That's the problem.
Oh, I did it.
I did it.
Oh, one note.
Tell you what.
Three.
I've been using that.
Two.
Three.
I'm ready.
Three.
Two.
One.
Stop.
stop.
