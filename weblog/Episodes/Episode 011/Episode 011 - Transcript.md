So we've had some desk submissions following the call for people to send them to us.
We're not going to be nasty.
We're going to be nice.
Well, actually, I'm speaking for all of us here.
Maybe some will.
I'm going to be nice.
I don't know about other people.
I might be cheeky.
Cheeky, nice, nasty, whatever.
It sounds like a Mr. Men series.
Anyway, which one are we going to kick off with, guys?
Well, in the folder, they are labeled by name and Craig is first.
So how about we start there?
Let's do it.
So Craig has kindly submitted this picture, which I believe you should see linked in your
show notes.
For those who want to play along at home, you can even talk to yourself, since you can't
really talk to us.
Or of course, quick plug here, you can talk to us in what ways we have a new Twitter account
at Hemispheric V if you want to send us different bits of feedback, since you can't really shout
at us through a microphone. Who knows? Maybe that could be a thing in the future. But who
wants to kick off here with Craig's photo? Very interesting picture.
First of all, I think this is awesome that we even got photos from people because I genuinely
love seeing what people set up their desks like. Just it's such a public space, but yet
at the same time, it's such a private look into someone's just, you know, what's going
on in their mind, because I think subconsciously we kind of decorate our
desks like, you know, as a reflection of ourselves, even though they're just this
wide open thing sitting in the middle of an office a lot of times, even with a
closed door office, there's still kind of this public aspect to it that anybody
could walk in at any time. Anyway, I think, okay, what do I got for Craig? So
first of all, the very first thing I noticed is that he has a Blackmagic
A T E M HDMI switcher on his desk, which is very cool.
Isn't it great? I love those black magic makes some great stuff.
So I was very happy to see that.
Can I, sorry, can I just chime in there and say just the,
I had as a dot point in comparison,
what is that giant soft button mixer desk thing?
That is the black magic A T E M HDMI switcher. Thank you.
I enjoyed the fact that the cable has a red cable tie on it, meaning that I'm led to believe
Craig likes to keep his cables neat, so I appreciate that.
I can confirm that. I will reveal that I do know Craig personally as a fellow Australian,
and his organizational skills through color coding are impeccable, so shout out to you, Craig.
You're a very neat man.
There's a solid collection of figurines in the background.
Back there with Darth Vader, Buzz Lightyear, Boba Fett,
little Simpsons action going on there. I love that.
I was curious if that is an actual beta movie camera above the monitor.
It is.
And if so, is it functional or is it just for looks?
I think, I was wondering if it was his webcam.
That would be amazing.
Can you imagine the number of positions?
Isn't it?
That is hilarious.
Maybe it's even plugged into the black magic switcher.
Who knows?
Is that even possible?
I hope so.
I would love if we could get some, some follow up on that.
I would love to know what that thing is doing.
If that were a webcam, that's like setup of the year.
Yeah, sure.
Um, let's see the inception going on with the photo with him being in the photo at
the same time as the photo is being taken.
I think was genius. I don't think anyone did that. And it makes you really try to figure
out what's going on because you've got the Buzz Lightyear there, but it's now on the
other side, seemingly behind. Yeah, there's a lot going on there. But what I did question
was the Buzz Lightyear seems to be doing a move, which I believe is called a dab. That's
how millennial I am and I'm curious if this is an on-purpose thing or if this
just happened to be the way that this Buzz Lightyear ended up on the desk so
if we could figure that out too that'd be great. Well you know Buzz comes to
life when nobody's around. Somebody may have walked in just as he was mid-dab.
Right as he was... okay that makes sense got it because you can't really tell in
the main photo but then you go into the photo photo and there he is so revealed.
The Facebook thumb? What's that about? Where'd that come from?
Would love to know that. I think he actually told me when I spoke to him
once a while ago that it actually came from Facebook in the US. Because it
looks like it's a very, you know, nice thumb. Like it wasn't something that just
came on the side of a cereal box or something. It looks like a pretty
substantial acrylic thumb. You know a high-quality thumb when you see one, dude.
I'm a pretty big thumb critic and I have to say that's a pretty good sized thumb.
Let's see. Oh, the hardhat GoPro setup in the background. That seems exciting. I bet that
gets a lot of use in the factory. And the iMac wallpaper I love.
Yeah, what you're looking at there is a hot rolled coil. So that is hot steel being rolled
in action which is pretty cool. I think what I really like about this photo as well, besides
all the things that you just said, is that he's used the ultra-wide lens very, very nicely. And
it's very hard to do that in a room with lots of straight lines. Do you know what I mean?
Sure.
Like nothing, I mean, you've got the buzz light here to the side, which may or may not be doing
to infinity and beyond dab in the corner, slightly cut off, but everything is nicely spaced.
and I feel like he's really focused things well. I don't know, maybe I'm paying too much attention
to that, but I think he's composed it quite well. And is that a magic mouse hidden under the iMac?
Yes. Like just in case? Yep. I think he heard the episode about the trackpad and was like,
you know what? Yep, this mouse is out of here. In comes the trackpad. Oh, also one last thing.
The, uh, yeah, the, the, the office phone is like tucked way behind everything else. And if
And if he's anything like me, they give you a phone, whether you want it or not.
And you're like, I'm never going to use that.
It just sits there covered with other stuff.
But you don't unplug it because as soon as you unplug it, IT gets alerted that something's
wrong with it and they come and bother you.
So you just mute it and shove it in the corner.
I think I left my last job and I had about 25 voice mails on my disk phone.
It's like, "Mel!"
If it's important, they'll find me another way.
I
Just want to pick up on that Facebook thumb because obviously that's frowned upon in these parts
and I did have I held Craig in high estimation and just
Just start to question some of that now that he's flaunting the Facebook thumb so proudly so Craig take a good long
Look at yourself, mate
While I'm hammering him one last bit of hammering
Actually, I'll get two more bits of hammering. Sorry Craig. I take this seriously
Jason was far too nice. Your sitting angles, they seem a little off. And I'm wondering how you sit
at a square desk, but with the angle of the keyboard slightly wonky.
I think what it is, you know, when you see a stock photo in a catalogue of someone sitting at a desk
and they're at the desk using it, but turn slightly to talk to a colleague who's just
entered with a very interesting thing on a clipboard. I think it's just to be ready for
for the door. Okay. You know what I mean? So it's unergonomic, but he's always ready.
He also has no apparent dock on his screen. He's got lots of icons, but no dock. And that's a bit
of a disappointment or a worry. Is he a hiding dock kind of guy? And if he's hiding it, where is
he hiding it? I feel a little bit like I've been cheated here. I somehow did not notice that. And
And I think the wallpaper was meant to throw me off from noticing that there was no Doc.
Because I was very-
You think he's deliberately deceptive.
I do.
I was very, very intrigued and excited by the bright, shiny wallpaper.
And I think that was meant to lead me away from the Doc.
So-
Yeah, say, "Molten steel.
Big deal.
Big deal.
Say it every day, mate.
Don't care.
Wish, Doc."
And you know what?
I'm starting to think as well.
I think he's positioned himself in that shot in the left monitor deliberately as if he's
taking a photo of the very coil that he already took a photo of.
Wow.
Craig Rhonda you Craig is taking the piss isn't he.
Geez Craig but I'm easy saves it he saves it because I think I notice under the desk it looks like I'm seeing a distinguished briefcase
and I like that because too many people use backpacks nowadays and I hate backpacks because they're really annoying like everything falls the bottom.
You can't find stuff. It's like how do you get it as dark in there a briefcase is gentlemanly
It's refined you pop it open. You've got a whole platform of
Open wide selection areas. Do you mean the ones that have those little golden number flickers those little codes?
Yeah, okay, and they pop open so if that is indeed a briefcase under there
Craig may have just saved himself
Fantastic. Yeah, gentlemanly redemption. That's that's what you're saying. I get fired out. I love desks. I love them
I've never heard about you know, I've listened to a lot of podcasts with a lot of rants
But I've never heard of ran out a briefcase
Hemispheric views first for such a hatred for backpacks. My gosh
It's a love-hate relationship. What if I ever see you with the back?
Wait, what happened to Andrew when he was when he was a kid and like a backpack jumped out of a closet and attacked him
I was always a duffel bag guy because at least a duffel bag can you can sort of flip open the lid and you get that open area you can see what you doing on it in there.
I'm getting a theme here duffel bags and briefcases at least in Hollywood films always contain criminal amounts of cash in them so what.
You got a thing for briefcases you had a duffel bag as a kid what about your past don't we know Andrew.
Don't worry about the past, worry about the present. I'm the CFO.
What about you Martin, have you got any comments on your friend Craig?
I think, like I said, I'm a fan of the composition. I think the be the movie camera is very cool.
I am also slightly put off by the ergonomics here, but like I accused you Andrew when we were criticizing your desk,
I do wonder if sometimes things are positioned for the sake of the photo.
but I'm willing to let this one slide.
Um, no, I think it's great.
I will have to say something that does slightly trouble me
is the number of icons on the desktop
because as we know from when you cross-examined me,
I keep things very clear.
Only things that I'm working on.
So I have a daily purge.
Craig, I understand you want things to be quickly accessible,
but, uh, look, it's like floor to ceiling.
ceiling it's too much for me so each to their own. I think you should go in there
just just delete them when he's at lunch
