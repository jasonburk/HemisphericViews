[Music]

Okay Andrew, how are you feeling?

Bit hazy.

Little bit, little bit fuzzy.

Turned into a pretty big night.

A lot of documentary watching,

Sudoku puzzles.

Yeah, conversation, laughter.

Trip to the library.

Beer.

Books.

Champagne, red wine, whiskey.

At the library?

Wow, you guys have crazy libraries.

Yeah, and really good dinner, really good food.

Steak, really delicious steak.

Thick, juicy.

At the library?

Yeah, at the library.

That's how we roll here in Perth.

Man, I had a big time headache this morning.

How are you cooking that steak?

Well, that wasn't me cooking it, so it's probably for the best.

There were thermometer probes, it was a charcoal barbecue,

and then finished in an oven.

It was sensational.

Cooking that to a rare to medium rare, or what's the...

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay, I just wanted to check in to see if I needed to just hang up right now.

If it was well done, I would have walked out,

the dinner party would have been over.

I've never been a fan of the fact that it's called well done,

because sometimes you want to say well done to someone's cooking,

but then if you say well done, then that's the bad one.

It's counterintuitive.

It's like mentioning a bomb when you're in the airport,

just don't say it.

Basically, yeah, it's absolutely, no.

Don't talk about bombs when you're ordering a steak,

and do not tell anyone at TSA that they are well done.

It does not go over well.

I'll take your shoes off instantly.

So, do they still have TSA in America?

Is it still as hardcore as it used to be?

Are you kidding me?

You think we're ever going to give up on that lark?

Never.

We're never giving up on that.

No, we can't.

Because don't you reckon Martin Australia's gotten pretty chilled about it again now?

Like, we still have the checks, but you can see nobody's heart's really in it.

No.

It's all good.

But when we actually went through security, because we did a flight little holiday recently,

Mac wasn't allowed to take his little plastic crocodile toy through,

because it is possible that someone under the age of three

could be carrying some sort of knife or explosives in a wild animal toy.

He was like, "I want my crocodile back."

And they're like, "You'll get it back."

So, that was serious.

Everyone else was laid back though.

In Australia, you can't have a crocodile toy.

Not on your person while being scanned as an infant.

No.

But you could probably have an actual crocodile as a support animal or something.

Maybe.

But I was told, "Oh, you need to take your watch and your ring off on one end

and then now leave it on through the other."

But they're using the same equipment.

But then a plastic crocodile needs to be put in the tray.

So, I'm not sure what the logic is there.

We have had this in the show notes for a little while,

McDonald's, Burger King, that kind of thing.

Just yesterday, McDonald's, global outage, couldn't buy a burger.

I saw that.

How timely.

Was it a hack?

Was it a cyber attack?

Was it just their systems failing them?

I haven't even read anything about the news because I don't really care.

But apparently, you couldn't buy a burger from McDonald's anywhere.

Is that right?

I would imagine it was a direct order from the king himself to shut them down.

Don't you think?

The Burger King?

The Burger King, yeah.

Nefarious.

I think so.

Well, whatever the cause, there was a panicked McFlurry of activity.

Oh, my goodness.

That's the last time I heard about McDonald's was when there was some kind of

uprising about ice cream machines or something.

I don't even know.

That's right, yeah.

That was a thing for a while.

They're always broken.

Broken in, you know, air quotes.

So, I don't know who put this in, but I can kick it off because I've got a

couple of serious questions about McDonald's.

You put it in, actually.

So, probably good for you to go.

Did I?

Yeah.

There should be a basketball there.

So, McDonald's, right?

I have a question because here in Australia, McDonald's is quite successful.

And they've successfully pitched themselves as a sort of a -- I don't want

to say high class, but a good place with a wide variety of foods,

sort of pitched to everybody.

Good, reliable option.

That's what McDonald's is here.

I remember going to then -- going to a McDonald's in the U.S.

and being stunned that it still felt like McDonald's from 1992 where

everything was falling apart.

It was dirty as anything.

It was basically like you got a Big Mac or you could get a McFeast

or something, and that was about it.

McFeast.

That's the thing.

Whereas here you go to McDonald's.

You go to McDonald's and we've got a My Maccas app that you can, like,

order from the comfort of your home, drive up, and it just gives you --

it recognizes you've arrived at the store, you yell out a code,

and suddenly your food just arrives and it's paid through Apple Pay.

Or when you go to the store, there's, like, big touch screen kiosks

and you can, like, do your order from there.

It's all very high-tech.

Then they'll deliver it to your table and it's all clean,

except for maybe the toilets.

I think they're always a bit skungy.

But I just feel like McDonald's in Australia has taken it to a new level.

You can get your coffees at the McCafe.

You get a barista-made coffee.

I'm just wondering, has the McDonald's in America stepped up to this

Australian McDonald's game yet, or are they still in the doldrums?

That's my opening gambit.

Opening gambit.

Yeah, very well done.

I have not been to a McDonald's probably since the 1992 that you are speaking of.

So in my mind, yes, McDonald's is still the same as it was in 1992.

But I do think that McDonald's is a -- like many chains,

is a different beast in different locations.

I think the McDonald's of the U.S. is probably nothing like the McDonald's of

Australia or the McDonald's of Japan or the McDonald's of, insert,

other country.

And I think they're all probably "better."

I would love to hear listener feedback, honestly, because, again,

I've not been in a very, very long time.

But I do think that they are of a different --

it's almost like they're only McDonald's --

McDonald's in name only in other places just for the recognizability of the

brand.

But everything else is completely gutted and changed out for something that's

better.

I think 7-Eleven is another kind of thing like that.

Like a 7-Eleven here, nope, no thanks.

Whereas a 7-Eleven -- I already talked about Japan -- a 7-Eleven in Japan is

like, awesome.

I want to go there all the time and get my lunch there.

I want to get all kinds of stuff there.

It's just like the same name but everything else is completely different.

So I imagine McDonald's is the same.

Okay.

Which leads me to my second gambit, if you can have a second gambit.

A closing gambit?

I think you're only allowed one gambit, but --

Damn it.

I'm not sure.

Okay, power move.

So in America you have something known as Burger King.

Burger King.

In Australia, for legal reasons dating way back to the 1970s or '80s,

we have Hungry Jack's.

It's the same thing.

We did have a Burger King when I was a kid in my suburb.

Really?

And then they rebadged it, yeah.

As we don't call it Hungry Jack's, we call it HJ's because that's what you do.

So you're going to get an HJ?

Yeah.

Interesting.

You've piqued my interest.

I'm fully on board for this conversation now.

Okay.

Now, HJ's, I don't know how it stands in comparison to Burger King.

I don't know what the --

I think the HJ's at Burger King are probably not as good, but maybe.

We get -- you get a Hungry Jack's and you will get a better burger

than what you get at McDonald's.

So is Hungry Jack's -- I think Burger King, and I'm not a fast food expert

here, but I think Burger King is the one -- is that the flame grilled whopper?

Correct.

Is it the same thing there where they're like, "Oh, we don't use a griddle.

We do like fire.

We cook everything with fire."

Yes.

Okay.

Yep.

Lots of ads with fire.

Yeah.

You got it.

The burgers are better at Hungry Jack's.

Not a sponsor, but that is the slogan.

They just straight up -- they just call it out.

Okay.

Nice.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And they sponsor the Australian Basketball League as well, so big time

sponsor of the Australian Basketball League.

Oh, yeah.

But while the burgers are better, they are highly variable.

You will -- okay, quite often you might get a shit one, depending on which

teenager happens to be working on the day.

A colleague of mine threw up as a result of one.

Yeah, that's bound to happen.

But they're still willing to take the risk.

And whenever you go into a Hungry Jack's, the cleanliness is never as good

as McDonald's.

It's always a bit seedier.

It's like a second-rate McDonald's.

They've recently installed touchscreens in the same way that McDonald's has

to take your orders, but they're just a bit crappier.

So everything about Hungry Jack's is crappier.

They put rolled-out barista coffee in all their restaurants as well.

I have not yet had the courage to try one because you look at it and you're

like, "No, I don't think so."

Again, a colleague orders Hungry Jack's coffee and prefers it to the

McDonald's equivalent.

So either way.

It might be better.

I'm just scared because I look at it and it just looks -- it's just like a bit

of a sheen of grime.

It just never feels like I'm really going to get a healthy option with that.

That's because they're putting all the effort into the burger and not the

cleaning of the establishment.

It's never clean.

I don't care.

I've gone to a number of Hungry Jack's around the Perth region and in Sydney

and so on.

They're never clean.

If I'm driving down any street in Australia, am I likely to see more

McDonald's or Hungry Jack's or is it fairly evenly distributed?

McDonald's.

More McDonald's.

Yeah.

And this is what I wanted to say.

I think what McDonald's has done in Australia is basically set itself as the

de facto emergency option at any time.

And you'll see on billboards -- maybe this is elsewhere in the world but I

haven't seen it quite the same way -- it'll be McDonald's in the next two

kilometers.

Or if there isn't one for a while, you'll see a ridiculously high number of

kilometers because it's the only option you're going to see for a very,

very long time.

And you'll see a Hungry Jack's occasionally -- well, not occasionally,

fairly regularly planted next to one kind of like, "Oh, burgers are better.

Maybe come in this one.

Give it a go."

If you can deal with the scungy bathrooms, as Andrew said, and get your flame

grilled whopper, you can do it.

But it's like, "Oh, you know, Macca's is here.

The kids are going to be happy with it.

We can get our variety of coffees or wraps or ever so slightly fancier Angus

burgers," which was a very successful advertising campaign in Australia.

Just a little bit fancy, not too much.

Macca's is the option for most people.

And is that the two -- not to rank them by good or bad, but just in

availability, is it basically Hungry Jack's and McDonald's?

Yes.

Yeah.

If you're talking burgers, we really don't have a third option.

Whereas you guys might have a Wendy's.

Is it Wendy's you have?

We got a Wendy's.

Or like In-N-Out burger.

Oh, In-N-Out is shit.

I thought that was a good one.

Doesn't Shake Shack do them as well?

In-N-Out is the worst hamburger ever made and the shittiest fries ever conceived.

And then you've got Five Guys.

Five Guys, yep.

We also have a weird thing where we have Carl's Jr. on the West Coast.

And then, like a Burger King Hungry Jack situation, it's named something

completely different on the East Coast, but it's the same thing.

So who knows how that works?

Well, Carl's Jr. is in Australia now.

Oh, okay.

Is it?

Yeah.

And to me, it just tastes like Hungry Jack's.

And answering your question, Andrew, about the Hungry Jack's versus Burger King

in the U.S. thing, we tried Burger King in New York when we were over there.

And I would say it tasted pretty much exactly the same.

Just obviously all the logos were different.

But it looked more like the Hungry Jack/Burger King of the past,

and they had table service, and they would give you alcohol

at this particular one at the World Trade Center.

So it was kind of like a weird retro restaurant version of what we have

in Australia with different logos.

Was it clean?

Yeah, quite clean because they were doing all the table service thing

and being a bit more attentive.

Oh, Jack in the Box also is another one.

Jack in the Box, Arby's.

There's an Arby's.

I think it's technically food.

If you only want chicken, there's Chick-fil-A, I suppose.

We do have that, yeah.

Everyone's ethical favorite.

Moving on.

You've got White Castle as well, don't you?

White Castle?

Those, I think, I could be mistaken, but I believe those are more

East Coast than West Coast.

They may be kind of all over now, but--

Harold and Kumar recommend?

So, yeah, we just have those two, and then it's basically Independence,

your local--where you're probably going to get a better burger.

You're going to get a real thing that you really want to actually eat

and go back to get again, yeah.

There's Grilled, but they don't really do drive-thru.

They're more in shopping centers.

Before we turn this just into Lister Burger Joint Corner,

do you have any nice memories as a kid of going to burger joints

or fast food?

I do.

I do, yeah.

When I think of fast food as a kid, I think of going on road trips

and getting McDonald's breakfast, which was like--

Yes!

--pancakes.

Yes! That's what I was going to say.

It was like a horribly terrible foam, overly complicated foam container

that still hasn't biodegraded to this day from back then, 40 years later.

It's stronger, in fact.

It had a whole lid, and then it had little compartments,

and you had your pancakes and I think a hash brown.

Maybe there was some bacon or eggs or something,

but it was like a whole little self-contained--

Like a bento box.

Kind of, yeah, yeah, exactly, like with a built-in tray almost,

so you can eat it in the car on the go because that's what we do.

That I remember as being like ultimate highlight of stopping off

at some place to get a food at like a fast food kind of place.

Yep, I share that memory.

I have a memory.

My brother, his first job was working at Hungry Jack's,

and I remember sometimes he would bring home like leftover apple pies,

like the hot apple pies.

Oh, the apple pies in those little sleeves.

Yes, and they're kind of deep-fried, so they get a bit bubbly on the outside.

Yeah.

And I remember sometimes if it was a good day, he would,

for whatever reason, probably steal a number of apple pies and come home,

and I would occasionally get one.

He just has a pocket full of apple pies.

Still warm.

So you guys had the same pancake thing going on with the McDonald's.

Not bacon and eggs, though, no.

It wasn't bento box, though.

No, it was just a tray with like three hotcakes in it

and a little sachet thing, little tub of maple syrup.

And the whipped butter.

Was it made out of that horrible foam?

Yes, it was, yeah.

The Hungry Jack's that was a Burger King that I mentioned before,

up until the last year or two, had the same 1950s kind of themed pictures

on the wall with all the like old American musicals and pictures

of James Dean and Elvis and stuff from when it was a Burger King.

I was like in primary school and they still had it up on the wall

post rebranding.

Our local ones that were never Burger Kings, though, are Hungry Jack's.

Hungry Jack's here went through that whole style as well,

like trying to make it the '50s diner.

And yeah, I think it's only been cleared out in the last couple of years,

but it doesn't look any better.

Still looks trash.

I mean, the '50s diner thing, that's like a very US thing, obviously.

Was that ever actually a thing there, or was this just like

we're trying to pretend like we're...

No, Australia had milk bars and stuff and you would have them run

by people like Greek migrants and they would have maybe that

diner look to them.

Maybe like the sort of thing you'd see in Back to the Future,

but not like we had fish and chips.

Sorry, we had fish and chip shops, milk bars, that sort of thing,

but not so much burger places as you would have had.

Like the drive up ones with like the people on roller skates

and stuff like that was like very, because America's so car-centric,

it was just like everything revolved around a car.

Now, I think Hungry Jacks here just seemed to go through this phase

where they're like, we're just going to be like throwback

to a different culture and make people feel cool about it.

Hungry Jacks is always weird like that.

It's always a bit try-hard and they always half-ass things.

They're like, we're going to be '50s, but we're not really going to be '50s.

They're not going to really embrace it at every level.

It's going to be a veneer of '50s, but it's still going to be like

shitty 2000s when you try and buy something.

It's like, look, there's some checkerboard pattern over there.

We're totally '50s.

Totally. Yes.

Look at that triangular neon. See? Job done.

That's Hungry Jacks. That is Hungry Jacks.

Half-ass burgers that taste better, but might make you sick.

They just chose to leave that part off of the slogan though.

What if we just stuck with better burgers and we left off the sick part?

What do you guys think?

You think that's maybe the way we should go?

Yeah, I think so. Go get them, Randy.

All right, so McDonald's or Hungry Jacks, final question.

You got to go get a burger right now.

Which do you pick, Andrew?

Hungry Jacks.

I'm getting a Whopper with cheese, mine's onion.

The burgers are better at Hungry Jacks, but I would go for McDonald's

just because I trust their variety a bit more.

Fries? Which one? Hungry Jacks?

Hungry Jacks fries are also better.

They're thicker. They're thick-cut fries now.

They went away from the little fries.

They couldn't compete.

And now they're actually really good.

What would you get?

Hungry Jacks is worth the 20% chance of illness.

You're getting Hungry Jacks, okay.

Or Burger King.

Burger King, yeah.

I'll get my little paper crown from here, I'll bring it with me,

and I'll wear it to Hungry Jacks.

That would be very confusing.

We get the crown.

I don't think they still do them.

They've typically always done the crown here.

Wait, Hungry Jacks has the Burger King crowns?

Yeah, of course.

That doesn't make any sense.

What?

All right.

It's the same--

Honestly, it's the same restaurant with different logos.

I don't know if you appreciate that.

It's just a different name because of the pre-existing--

So is there a Burger King?

There was, but they no longer exist because they're renamed Hungry Jacks.

Oh, my God. That's infuriating.

In a crazy experiment, I've been using Firefox for the last couple of weeks.

The browser.

Yeah.

Not the fox that's on fire.

Clarify that.

Not Ice Weasel.

This is Firefox.

Firefox.

And it's been a long time since I've really ever used Firefox.

I've got to say, I'm quite enjoying it on Mac OS.

That was a very quick qualification there.

There was no pause between I'm enjoying it and the clarification of where.

Okay.

Tell me more about that.

I remember using it a while ago, and it seemed dog slow.

Just everything seemed really slow about it.

This time I'm using it, it feels really snappy.

The user interface seems kind of nice.

I'm enjoying it.

I feel like I'm supporting the underdog, which is also a lovely thing and very Australian.

We love an underdog story.

No, I'd like to see them crushed, frankly.

Got my extension set up.

Yeah.

I tried to use it on iOS, iPadOS, and all that.

And I know they let you choose the default browser,

but they really don't want you to change the default browser.

But even despite all that, the thing that just put me off, I couldn't use it,

was the way that the scrolling, it was a little bit janky.

And you would scroll off, and the Firefox browser there sort of hides the URL bar.

But the way it does it, I found that I kept losing my place on the screen.

It would sort of scroll.

It would hide the URL bit, but then the viewport would sort of change.

And so I would always lose my place.

It's hard to explain, but I experienced it about five times.

I was like, "Nah, I'm done.

Back to Safari."

So the downside is that now I don't have anything syncing.

So, you know, your history of sites that you've looked at

and all that kind of thing is not entirely in sync.

But cookies do a pretty good job with that.

Site-specific cookies do a pretty good job of keeping track anyway.

The other thing I don't like on the desktop is the two-factor codes.

If you still get SMS codes or email codes,

the way that Safari utilizes those and prefills it is awesome.

And I do feel that, weirdly, Safari has always been typically bad with extensions.

I feel like my ad-blocking experience in particular is actually better on Safari

than Firefox.

Despite having a piehole and an ad-blocker, what am I using here on Firefox?

I'm using uBlock Origin.

Is that the prequel to uBlock?

uBlock Resurrection.

But overall, overall, I'm enjoying it.

I'm enjoying it.

I have one question, but Jason has more.

I have a couple of notes that I could give you.

Sure.

Let's see.

Number one, I love the Firefox icon, for whatever that's worth.

Oh, I don't.

For two-factor codes, I think you use Alfred now.

There's like a little thingy that'll kind of suck in your two-factor code

so you can paste it.

Oh, okay.

I don't use Alfred anymore.

That was short-lived.

Well, that lasted an hour.

There's a basketball coming up about that,

or at least it's related, I can say.

The only other thing I was going to add was that Firefox is a browser,

definitely.

I just always get Windows vibes from it in the sense that you look at Windows 11

and seemingly every menu you go into, you get further and further back

into Firefox 1.0, it feels like.

It's archaeological.

Yeah, basically.

Yeah, syncing between stuff is not usually fun.

It's almost like iOS doesn't actually want you to use anything else.

It's so weird.

I know they would never do that, but it seems like it's impossible to use

fucking anything else on that goddamn phone.

Weird.

But I'm happy to hear you're using Firefox now.

So has it been, what, like a couple hours now?

No, this has been two weeks.

This has been two weeks, and I'm okay with it.

I'm very happy, very happy.

Arc lost me because they went to AI that didn't like their direction.

You didn't like their Arc, yeah.

Just a plucky underdog.

And Safari is just boring, so boring.

No, it's not.

It's reliable.

It's snappy.

It just does what you want, and it's integrated with everything Apple.

In fact, the question I was going to ask you, and then I was hesitating to even

ask it because I feel like it would just lead to a whole repeat of Episode 97,

Jewel of the Defaults.

Why do you do this to yourself?

Boredom.

Attention deficit hyperactive disorder, maybe.

I don't know.

That was more brief than I thought.

Have you gone into Vivaldi yet?

Are we in Vivaldi territory?

I have Vivaldi installed.

Yeah, of course I do.

But I don't -- too many tiny icons and like side panels and a little bit too

much going on.

And then you can almost do like tree-level, tree-style tabbing,

and it just gets overwhelming.

I think maybe Gopher?

You could just go back to that.

Maybe that would be just text only.

Maybe.

Yeah, maybe.

Is that still in the terminal?

If I fire up a terminal now, can I just get Gopher?

Do I need to -- I might have to grab that from --

Oh, you probably got to change your e-mails config.

It's like there's a hole, yeah.

Yeah, I just tried typing Gopher and it didn't -- come out not found.

Maybe links.

Good luck with your Firefox experiment.

I'm excited by it.

I don't think it's an experiment anymore.

I think I'm a Firefox guy.

Oh, good for you.

I'm glad we finally have a Firefox guy in our ranks.

We've been waiting.

Are you still a Beach guy?

Yes, I am still a Beach guy.

Okay.

I haven't been a Beach guy for a couple of weeks because I haven't had time.

Well, you've been testing Firefox.

You can't do both.

Yeah, and I can't test it on my iOS device.

You can't use it on your mobile device, so what the hell?

The lure of the sunny day wasn't strong enough to pull you away from Firefox.

No.

I'm an Edge guy when I'm at work, though.

Oh, Edge guy, yeah.

Well, we've always thought of you as an Edge guy.

Edge case.

How often are you edging?

Two or three times a week.

[Music]

Yeah, I was just going to bring up, is this follow in, follow up, follow middle?

Follow middle.

We'll call it follow middle.

We had talked about notes and reminders and photos and putting things from there onto the web

and how that like wasn't really a thing if you're using those.

And Josh wrote us a little email about the subject line is Anton's Things.

Okay.

And I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

And this are a few tools that looks like you can do things like publishing Apple Notes as web pages,

shoving Apple Reminders up to the web as a web page,

and then creating photo, I guess, gallery is probably the best way to say it from your Apple Photos.

So just kind of some interesting tools that I sure as hell didn't know existed.

The notes will be, or the links will be in the show notes, of course.

But, yeah, thanks, Josh Withers, for writing and letting us know that these exist.

Never had any idea that this was a thing, and that's super cool that somebody has figured out a way to do that.

Yeah, I'll put those in the notes, but that's your follow middle, middle follow, we'll call that.

I submitted a Mastodon poll about launch traps.

Jason, you mentioned earlier that I was a Alfred user, and I was for a few days,

until I realized that just certain elements of it did not match my brain.

And I thought I can continue to fight this, because everybody says how amazing Alfred is,

or I could just go back to what I know, which I kind of did.

So now I went back to LaunchBar, the one true launcher, which lets me do everything I ever want to do.

Wouldn't Quicksilver be the one true launcher?

Well, that's an interesting point.

And Quicksilver was one of the reasons I bought my first Mac,

because I saw Quicksilver demoed or something, and I was like, I want that.

And literally bought a Mac, and the first software thing I installed was Quicksilver.

And that rotating cube, oh my goodness, that was amazing.

Loved it.

So I've always been a launcher guy, always had some sort of launcher.

After Quicksilver, I went to LaunchBar.

Firefox guy, beach guy, launcher guy, just want to make sure I'm keeping...

That's it.

I just try to keep track of my own head. It's very hard.

I wanted to see what other people did.

So my poll was simply, which Mac OS launcher/Swiss Army Knife do you use?

And this is my most successful Master Dom poll ever.

Well, I'm getting to that.

266 people, plus one other guy, I think, who wanted to vote and didn't.

So maybe 267 responded.

That's a lot.

Responses were, in last place, LaunchBar.

App of choice.

Only 6% of respondents with LaunchBar as their preferred app.

Pretty sad.

I think it comes back to the community aspect of it.

LaunchBar, the developer just develops it.

He doesn't really promote it or build community around it.

And so it's struggling.

But it is a great app. Give it a go.

In second place, Robbubub's app, Alfred, 29%.

In third place, 31%, Raycast.

That one that I've been a little skeptical of because of its privacy policies and what have you.

But I think 31% of people are saying it's good.

So I should try it.

So currently I'm using Raycast.

I love it.

I love Raycast especially because everybody that rails against ARC because they've done anything with AI,

fall over themselves over Raycast, who does the exact same stuff.

So, cool.

I haven't touched the AI stuff to be perfectly honest.

The winner...

You don't have to in ARC either, but go ahead.

The winner, 35% of users.

The finder.

Tell me what it is, Martin.

What's that launcher that's won 35% of the vote?

Spotlight.

Thank you very much.

Correct.

People, why are you using Spotlight?

Do yourself a favor.

Like, these other apps can do so much more.

Get on it.

But there you go.

So, interesting insight.

The best app is not always the most popular.

Launch Bar, 6%.

You are still the granddaddy.

I love you, even though I'm using Raycast.

I will come back to you.

I know it.

But can we get to the most important thing, which is that Spotlight is the best name?

Best name?

Yeah.

I disagree.

Disagree.

Spotlight invokes searching.

That's what it is.

Yeah, and that's all it can do.

Exactly.

These other apps can do so much more.

They can search, but they can...

But that's why it's successful, because it's clear in its purpose.

They can launch, they can edit, they can append, they can prepend, they can move files.

It's like, who's Alfred and why is he in my computer?

Alfred's your little helper.

He's your little butler.

I could listen to you guys argue about Spotlight and whatever forever.

The most stupid name.

People download Raycast and they go, "I thought I was getting a podcast app.

What the hell is this thing?"

Raycast is a stupid name.

That is a bad name.

A launch bar, it's like...

It's a bar that launches.

Is this the launcher from old Mac OS?

A bar?

But we've got the menu bar and then we've got the dock.

What's this launch bar?

Launch bar is beautiful.

The hardest thing about launch bar is figuring out whether bar should be capitalized or not.

The B in bar.

Well, look, you're digging yourself into a hole with the name thing.

That's not a good name thing.

In fact, all of these suffer that problem.

Spotlight, should the L be capitalized and Raycast should be C?

There's never any confusion about that because it's just written as Spotlight, which is the word.

And Alfred, should the R in red be capitalized?

We don't know.

Come on.

So what I'm hearing is the thing that you use, you feel is the best one.

That seems about right.

Yeah, disregard the poll response, really.

Just listen to me.

Okay.

So basically, I put out a poll, didn't like what I heard, stuffy is all, I'm correct.

Yes.

Yeah.

It's democracy working.

I'm going to say a word and I want you to tell me if you've heard of this thing.

Okay.

Are you ready?

Is it Perth?

No, but it does start with a P.

Podcasts.

Have you heard of these?

Sorry, could you say that again?

Yeah.

Podcasts.

I know I don't.

I don't know where the name comes from, but if you have you heard of these there, so there

these like audio files that are somewhere up in some kind of cloud, I'm told and you

have a little machine that you keep in your pocket that you can then pull these audio

files down automatically.

You don't even have to think about it to this little device and then little voices come

out of it and tell you things crazy, right?

Voices in your head that yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

Go on.

Yeah.

So I wanted to introduce you a new segment called.

Here's another podcast that you can listen to in your podcast player of choice corner.

Sounds good.

Are you ready?

This little podcast that I'd like to introduce to everyone is called.

Let me make sure I say the name correct.

The Atlas Obscura podcast.

Have you heard of this one?

Very good.

Yep.

So many cool little stories in there.

There was one in there recently about a Big Mac.

So that ties in nicely.

Cool.

Some Australia stuff was in there recently, which was great.

So yeah, the other podcast that you can listen to in your podcast player of choice corner

recommendation of the week is the Atlas Obscura podcast.

So is this technically a media corner?

It's media corner.

Or other podcasts that you can listen to in your podcast player of choice corner.

Right.

Andrew will trust you to make a jingle for that.

All right.

Let's see what I can do.

Off you go.

Oh, you want me to do it now?

Yeah.

Like now would be good.

Yeah.

Okay.

You're going to have to say it Jason.

Okay.

I'm going to cut to you.

Okay.

I'm going to jingle it up.

Then you've got to say the line.

Okay.

We've got podcasts.

We've got shows.

We've got a special section for you.

It's called.

It's another podcast you can listen to in your podcast player of choice corner.

Ah, nailed it once again.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I don't know what to do after that.

I'm a bit disappointed that you didn't stick with the onion though because it would have

segwayed beautifully in with our earlier burger topic because you always put onions in, well,

most people put onions in burgers.

I minus them, as I said.

But you never get bok choy in a burger.

So the next one's a basketball.

Yes.

This has popped up in a hurry.

It says, "If I were a car, then I would be..."

And then in brackets, "But I can't be Toyota."

Damn it.

What's the point of this game?

Okay.

If I were a car, then I would be...

Who would I be?

I think I would be a Bensley.

Wow.

Because you have a little umbrella that comes out of your right arm?

No, because...

I was going to say, if you go for Lexus because it's like fancy Toyota, then you're a wanker,

but you went even beyond that.

He's like, "No, screw it.

I'm going out of the stratosphere.

I'm going well beyond."

Because to some people's eyes, I'm not that attractive and I'm a little bit ostentatious.

But actually, I'm just very fancy and worth a lot of money.

I purr like a kitten, but I can rev like a lion.

Lions rev?

Yeah.

I value comfort above practicality.

And I'm a person of the royals.

Really?

You're a monarchist.

You value comfort over practicality.

Do we really believe that?

The guy that's keeping track of grains of rice in a spreadsheet in his kitchen values

comfort over practicality?

I'm probably not a Bentley.

I'm probably more like a...

A Daihatsu?

Oh, I was going to say a Mini Cooper S, but yeah, Daihatsu.

I like that.

I was thinking a bluebird with a trunk held closed with an ethernet cable.

But...

It's just too hard.

I don't think I'm...

I don't know enough about cars.

All right, let's move on to the next one.

If I were a condiment, then I would be...

Should there be an ellipse on that?

Oh, there is.

It's just behind my mouse.

Okay, just checking.

I would go barbecue sauce, but I'm just picking that based on the fact that it is my favorite

condiment.

I don't think that's what the question is really driving at.

I think I'm going to go with Kewpie mayo because it's not really very good for you.

It's pretty weird.

And the container is terrifyingly scary.

So I think that's why I would choose Kewpie mayo.

Because you're unhealthy and scary.

Yeah, see?

Imagine putting a little bit of me on a Martin stir fry.

Oh my gosh.

See, if I were a condiment, I think I'd be Vegemite because it presents itself as fun

and easygoing, but it actually is a little bit salty.

Yeah.

And you just want to stick it in the back of the cabinet and hope that you forget about

it.

Eww, yeast.

Just one last one.

Is this a live show?

This is like a live show now, technically.

It's all just sort of happening.

Yeah.

Okay.

So if you were...

I'm really going to think about this one.

... a misspelled word, what would you be?

It looks correct to me, odor.

But you can adjust it as you like.

I'm going to go with a little bit of a...

I'm going to go with a little bit of a...

I'm going to go with a little bit of a...

I'm going to go with a little bit of a...

I think this is some of our finest work, you two.
