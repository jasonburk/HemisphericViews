I'm on a weekend or away, so I'm perched here in the unused children's bedroom.

And I have a bunny rabbit holding my microphone up.

Oh, that is actually holding it up.

Yeah. Okay.

I didn't take a screenshot of this for the listeners.

We'll pop it in the in the show notes.

Andrew, can you just give us a thumbs up with your bunny?

What's your bunny called?

He's called Tissue because he's actually a tissue box.

And I've shoved my somewhat microphone stand into the guts of the bunny where the tissues would normally pop out.

And it's holding microphones.

I've got a little bunny guy.

Is that the box for the microphone behind you?

Oh, yes, it is.

I've got a...

Yes, it's the Rode Podcaster again.

And then I've got this just in case, which is an iPad stand, but it has been used as a microphone stand in the past.

Because you can kind of pull that and trap it.

Very rudimentary.

I feel like we were better put together on episode two than episode 120.

What has happened?

And I'm sitting on the floor, so I've got a limited lifespan in me as well, because, you know, the hips and the butt, all that kind of stuff.

Speak for yourselves, though, because I'm in the same spot, in the same chair with the same USB microphone that cost like as a combo from JB Hi-Fi.

Like, I am pure, permanent amateur setup.

Has not changed.

Says the PhD of podcasting.

This is cheapo, massive cheapo, right?

Just avoid all the extra expense.

Well, sitting on the floor is good, though.

And that's your advice, Jason, isn't it?

If you can't fall asleep, like he sits on the floor when he's podcasting, but not when you tell him to.

I'm actually concerned that this is going to make him fall asleep now and he's going to fall asleep, bitch.

We'll see.

It's fine.

Keep it interesting.

Take a nap.

I have to segue to this now because I saw from Jason Robot in the notes, I have a special guest.

I did not know of a guest.

Were you told about a guest, Andrew?

I was not.

No.

That makes it all the more special.

Jason, who the hell is this person in our call here?

I like to keep things exciting, as you know.

I'm a big fan of surprises.

I like when you don't know what's coming.

So today, with flawless entry into our regular workflow, as if you never even knew something had changed, I inserted a new person into the episode, being 120.

There were no technical difficulties.

Everything worked flawlessly.

It's like you didn't even know they were here.

But here they are live to tape from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

The one and probably only, maybe there's two, we don't know, but we'll say one and only to get the numbers up.

Scotty Jackson is here.

Hi guys.

I, first of all, need to pick up on one thing.

Andrew, did you say that you were broadcasting from an unused children's bedroom?

Yes.

Why do you have an unused child?

They didn't serve their purpose.

So.

Are you referring to West Australian child labor?

Is that, is that the issue?

Like they should be put to productive work?

Yeah, they just sit around.

It's like, not good.

We need to get them cleaning chimneys or something.

So you're like, get out of here.

I'm going to use this room for podcasting from now on.

Fortunately, there are no children.

So, so it is an empty room.

Perfect.

Fully kitted out for children, if there were children with me, which there are not.

Well, it's very lovely to be here.

What is most remarkable, this is the first time that I've enjoyed the opportunity to

have a, a video call with Martin because we have never video called before.

And that's very exciting.

Thank you.

And I feel like now that I've been on the, this is my third opportunity

to be a hemispheric drop in.

So I think that we'll have to start calling me Scotty two Ts Jackson, because

I'm getting into like Rob territory.

Treaties shout out the two B's.

Okay.

You can, you can run with that if you want to.

Does that make you a Canadian ambassador?

Is that it?

Well, I would like that very much.

I mean, that's, is there documented expectation letters that come along with

that and what, what all is entailed in that particular role and responsibility?

Because so far, the only thing that I know about that role is to try and keep.

Jason on his side of the line.

And I've obviously failed because here he is broadcasting live to

tape from, Hey, Scotty, J's basement.

Yeah.

So what's going on here, guys?

You got to, this is very strange.

Explain yourself, Jason.

So it was late Thursday or no late Wednesday.

And I was in my house and then all of a sudden I woke up and I was in Canada.

Surprisingly, I came to the airport, you know, as you do, I landed at the airport.

I walked through the baggage claim area that's surrounded by hockey things.

Cause you have to talk about hockey when you're here or else you get beat up.

And then behold, you know, when you get to the airport and you, if you're fancy,

you have like a person that's waiting there for you with like a little sign.

Yes.

That says your name or whatever.

And they usually have like a little suit on a little cap.

Well, the big doors whoosh open from the secure to non-secure area.

Right?

So I'm now transitioning from safety to non-safety within the Canada.

The Canada.

Is that what they call it?

Yeah.

It's the Canada.

Like the Ukraine.

Yep.

Exactly.

Uh, very similar.

You know, I just got off a flight.

I'm kind of discombobulated a little bit.

I'm looking at my phone trying to figure out like, how do I get a car thing to get to

where I'm staying?

And I look up and there's a person standing there that looks very similar to

the person you're looking at right now.

And I don't immediately recognize the person, but they're holding a sign and I

see the sign.

There's words on the bottom.

I'm blurry eyed, you know, again, travel, stressful, but a giant icon on there of

none other than the bear beta icon with the big googly eyes.

And I almost died.

I saw it.

I saw it again.

I saw it a third time.

I could not believe my eyes and I looked at it.

I looked up.

I looked back down.

I looked back up and yeah, apparently my, my, uh, my driver for the day was none

other than, uh, than Scotty with, um, with the bear beta.

It was, it was incredible.

If I wish I had somebody following me around with the camera constantly, just

recording my mundane life, because it would have been one of the all time

greatest events.

So I'm in Canada.

It's, um, happy birthday to Scotty.

It's his birthday.

So I came here for his birthday.

Oh, happy birthday.

That's fantastic.

Best wishes.

Thanks guys.

I don't understand why Andrew and Martin didn't come, but that's okay.

Exactly.

Well, clearly the invitation was not extended from our us counterpart.

So, um, here we go.

It's probably still in the mail.

Oh, it'll never get here.

No, it'll never get here.

I was going to say, according to the postal service, it'll be there probably next

month.

I'm pretty sure though, that I did see an email from on track that said any minute

now, something to that effect.

You mean Star Trek?

Was it Star Trek?

Star Trek.

Yes.

Yes.

Star Trek.

Star Trek.

Oh, I blew the, can you fix that in post for me, please?

Whoever it's going.

I think it's funny.

I'm just cleaning.

Okay.

Thanks.

Yeah.

Um, happy birthday.

Thank you.

The name on the sign underneath the bear icon was first initial a middle name,

Cordy, last name on tags so that it would be like accordion tags, which is the only

way to tag.

Um, I mean, it takes having at least seven bear icons in your doc as, as Andrew would,

would attest to, because I mean, you can't be a hypocrite unless you say

hypocritical things, right, Andrew.

So I think, I think that having an opportunity to make sure that bear is greatly

embedded in the hemispheric experience is important.

Is the googly eyed version and app icon option yet?

I feel like it should be.

It is.

Yeah.

It was just for the, the actual beta, but then they made it an actual icon you can

choose, which is the only right option.

Right.

So there you go.

Yep.

So there you go.

That's why I'm here.

The next item says that, uh, Andrew is away, although he's not away.

So, uh, explain yourself because you were meant to be away, but you are clearly here.

Yes.

So I was meant to be away.

Thank you to all of you because I rescheduled this recording away from my normal time again,

after we changed it last week.

I was supposed to meet with New South, New South Wales Premier right now, but I had to

put that off for you.

So, no, this is good.

I'm on a, um, a little weekend getaway.

So I'm about two and a half hours South of Perth.

In the ocean.

Well, you know, right near the beach.

I can, I have beach views because as you know, I'm a beach guy.

So it was still a bit too cold to get in the water, but you can just look at it from a,

from a distance and go, that's the ocean.

Looks great.

So yeah.

So I'm in another weird recording studio, which is why I have the bunny

rabbit holding my microphone, but I wouldn't miss it for the world.

So I'm here and I'm hoping that this wifi holds out.

There wasn't much energy in that.

So I don't know if I can use the title of there's the ocean.

It's great.

Cause I have to put exclamation points at the end of every title.

So I'm not quite sure that I could use that.

There was not, there was like 30% energy there.

Could you use a question mark instead?

No, he can't.

I think that's a good idea.

Question mark.

Just break it.

Well, what if you had an interrobang?

Would you do that, Jason?

I like a good interrobang.

Of course you do.

I'm sorry.

I'm not enthusiastic enough.

I actually woke up this morning feeling just a slightly bit unwell.

So it's a little bit of a downer on the, um, on a getaway weekend, but I'm

hoping I'll bounce back.

So maybe by the end of the show, I'll, it summons more enthusiasm.

I'm sorry to hear you're unwell, but I feel that that's a better justification

because it's like I'm on holiday.

The ocean's in the distance.

Great.

That's exactly what he just did.

This is the best, this is the best trip of my life.

Wow.

Ocean weekend, whatever.

Um, okay.

Well, Andrew's here.

So we've got that covered.

Yeah.

Um, we, we could strike that through.

Do you want to, do you want to.

Strike that through, uh, Martin, can you do a strike through?

I'm the strike through guy.

Yeah.

You're a strike through guy.

Do I have to come up with a page that makes it's just, I'm a strike through guy.

That's it.

I think you have to.

Yeah, I'll do it.

I'll do it for you.

Thank you so much.

You're welcome.

Rob can maybe add it to his RSS feed.

Maybe he can have a guy, a guy feed and a, and a defaults feed and, uh, another,

you know, expanding universe of the ways in which we define ourselves and what

things out there are the most, you know, mirrored to the best selves that we want

ourselves to be.

It was inspirational.

Thank you, Scotty.

Never again.

When did we, how did we get followup?

Where did this come from?

I put it there because there's a foot and it's a followup from something.

Oh, it's followup from you.

Yes.

Not from someone else.

Oh, okay.

Got it.

No, no, I, I'm not in the habit.

It's like, Hey Scotty, you have followup.

You didn't know.

I put it in there, but it's under a foot surprise.

Ha anyway, no, it doesn't work that way.

Ah, okay.

That's a Jason move for guest management.

Yeah, exactly.

Just keep on your toes or feet.

Keep you on your feet.

Actually, that just sounds stable.

Now, um, follow up.

Right.

So you may remember, and listeners, you may remember that, uh, recently I discussed

the issue of my name never being understood at cafes.

Right.

And Jason put it out there that, Hey Martin, maybe you're just not saying your name

properly.

Maybe you're an idiot Australian who can't pronounce an R the way that an American

would.

So that's your problem.

Well, I'm here to tell you that it goes beyond the oral or the oral.

It actually goes into the written sphere.

I experienced a very perplexing issue with my name in written form that I'd like to

share with you all right now.

And then there'll be an extension to another mini story.

But first, uh, recently had to go to university library, borrow some books.

They did not have the books that I wanted, but they could do an interlibrary loan.

They could bring it down from another university in Sydney.

I was like, fantastic.

Thanks very much.

Let me know when it arrives.

So a week passes, the books arrive and I get a little notification in my inbox saying,

Hey, come pick them up.

There's a little shelf next to the normal, you know, uh, borrowing machine and you can

come get it.

And I went there and they had the three books and I have right here, the three handwritten

slips from the university library with my name on it.

The first one says Martin Feld.

Fantastic.

Spelt correctly.

I was most pleased because it's actually in my record.

You can see it on my library card, all the profiles.

It's there.

The second one says, surprise, surprise, Martin Feld, as you would expect.

Then we reached the third one.

Can I, can I guess what the third one says?

Go for it.

Does it say Martin Feld?

It does not.

Ah, would anyone else like to have a guess?

Is it Morton?

That would actually be close up.

This is Mark Field.

Who the hell is Mark Field?

Mark Field.

Did you just take somebody else's book?

You sure it was yours?

Mark's wandering around the library.

No, it is exactly the one that I wanted.

All three books are by the same author and they were brought from another institution and

they're next to each other.

And for some reason they're like, you know what, bugger it.

We heard hemispheric views.

We're going to piss off Martin and not tell him.

All right.

And he can walk up and see this.

So I just wanted to put it out there that for some reason people have some sort of muscular

spasm or distracted moment when saying or writing or listening to my name.

And look, I'm not offended.

I'm just perplexed.

And I want to get to the root of the problem.

What is up with my name?

Were all three of them all on the shelf next to each other?

They were.

I am led to believe by the handwriting that someone else wrote the Mark Field.

I don't know if it was the same person, but it's.

Ah.

But for some reason someone has looked at the name that is on the borrowing request on the

profile that I've had with university since I enrolled as like an early entry person in high

school. And they went, you know what?

Screw it. He's someone else today.

So there goes your theory of my not being able to speak properly.

Jason.

Mark Field.

I think those forms, you need to frame them and hang them on the wall.

I think I will.

Yeah.

Yeah.

The three of them in a triptych.

I know I wasn't invited and I know that this wasn't the plan, but I'd like to take this

opportunity to share a story because in case you were worried that this was some sort of

like American or Australian phenomenon, I can share with you that it is not.

I called our pizza place.

This was a few months ago, but we've been ordering from the same place like forever,

forever, but their churn is probably very high.

And she said, can I get a name for the order, please?

And I said, sure.

It's Scotty.

And there was long silence.

And she said, sorry.

And I said, Scotty.

And there was a long silence.

And then she said, okay.

And I thought, uh-oh, but I, but I figured we've got a phone number that we can fall

back on and I know what I've ordered.

So when I go to pick it up, I'm sure, I'm sure everything will be okay.

So I go into the pizza place.

I said, I have a pickup order for Scotty.

And she said, what's your phone number?

So I told the phone number.

She said, oh, this, this, this one ending in these four numbers.

I said, yes, that's the one.

And she said, look, I'm really sorry.

I didn't write down your name because I didn't know how to spell strutty

strutty.

And I, and I said that that's okay.

Like no one does because, because that's not a name.

Like that's not a thing that anyone calls another person.

That's just, that's just bizarre.

Oh my goodness.

I just figured, no, just let her off the hook and she can go on, live her best life

and feel like there's, there's someone out there named strutty who's okay with

his name being misspelled.

I feel so much better that you've shared that.

Thank you.

Strutty.

It's the Canadian way.

You're happy to be referred to that way throughout the rest of the episode.

No, I am not.

I'm not happy about that.

In fact, I am actually in the process of dealing with the archives of the

Institute and the government and all of the admin necessary to complete a legal

name change because I am having my name legally changed to Samantha.

No, uh, to Scotty.

I'm having the Y put on, I'm a legal Scott and I'm going to be legally Scotty

because I've gone by Scotty for like over 30 years and I was in a hospital

office and they had to call me like three times and came out like saying Scott.

And I just didn't respond at all.

Cause I've no one calls me that.

That's just not, it's not my name.

It's not my identity.

So I'm going through the legal challenges of buying a Y.

You're really actually doing that.

That's amazing.

Wow.

Yeah.

I'm, I'm really doing it.

Wow.

It's, it's a, it's a neat experiment.

Hey, strutty J.

This is just something that I thought might be interesting to share, particularly

from the perspective of hemispheres.

Right.

And I don't know this about this so much in Canada, Scotty, but I know that in the

U S the word sir is used quite habitually or much more normally or usually, or, you

know, in a more common way than what it is in Australia the other day, or maybe like

a week or so ago, was it?

Yeah.

A week, a week ago, we were out for a, uh, for a dinner with some of Natasha's

extended family.

And when we wrapped up and we were walking back to the car park, this was an

interesting experience for me.

We were walking just the three of us, me, Natasha and Mac, and I was holding Mac's

hand as we were approaching the car park to leave.

And there were these guys in front of us.

I reckon that would have been around kind of like 18, 19, 20.

And they kind of had the, I'm going to sound very old saying this, but this is

kind of the point of the story.

They had a kind of hoodlum vibe to them, right?

Not bogans, not criminals, but hoodlums.

And they were actually wearing hoods.

So I feel justified in using that word.

Not sure about the lum bit, but definitely the hoods.

Okay.

And as we approached, um, they like we're walking behind them towards the car park.

They stopped in front of us without warning and just kind of decided to

congregate there for a chat.

But then one of them instantly noticed that we were coming and knew that they were in

the way and turned and went, "Oh, sorry, sir."

And then moved out of the way.

And it was like, "Huh, that's interesting.

I've never been called sir in any kind of situation like that outside of maybe a

formal like hospitality or retail situation."

And I thought, "That's interesting."

And Natasha said, "Hmm, that's an interesting kind of sign of age."

Or they've habitually kind of said it because that's what they say to their teachers.

So I was like, "Wow, what kind of echelon of society or recognition have I now

achieved by holding a three-year-old's hand among these hoodlums?"

Yeah, because now that you're Mark Field, you gained status.

They could feel you're Mark Field.

Yeah.

I just thought it was very fascinating.

That's weird.

I felt kind of respected, but also significantly aged at the same time.

I don't know.

What do you all think of that?

Is sir a normal thing?

I don't think the youth here...

Well, I'm in a different place now, but at home, I don't think it's used extensively.

I use it a lot regardless of age, but I think that's probably due to military

ingrainedness of sir and ma'am being drilled into you every day forever.

So I could see that being part of it.

But I don't know.

I don't see sir in the US being a real dramatically formal thing.

Just more of a, "Hey, I want to have some kind of respect shown in a way that's not

just like, yes, or thank you."

But it's just a little addendum, a little top hat on the being nice, if you will.

It is a top hat.

You're right.

What about in Canada?

Is sir a thing?

Kind of like what Jason said.

I think that's the sort of thing that I would say to a stranger as a way of

signaling like, "Hey, I come in peace."

And like outside of hospitality, it's just be like, "Hey, can I get the door for you,

sir?"

Or not like indifference to, and I don't think it has anything to do with age.

I think it's just a little way of adding a tone of politeness to a stranger.

Like, uh, like that.

Although I see that also as the term that would be like really easy to dig in with a

sarcastic spin and be like, "Oh, sorry, sir."

I think, I think it would probably be used in that context more frequently, but

the tonality would give it away.

I think this is probably just a kid, um, reacting just more to the

situation than to your age.

I think he was just signaling like, "You might think I'm a hoodlum, but I'm actually

all right.

And I'm on the right track and I've been raised okay.

And my parents love me.

And I just, I just wear, I just find this kind of clothing comfortable and it's all

right.

And I'm not going to stab you or your family and it's all going to be okay, sir."

Yeah.

And look, I took no offense to it.

I think it was nice.

I just was not used to receiving that title.

Refreshing to have that kind of authority recognized.

I feel very uncomfortable either using or being the recipient of sir.

It just doesn't feel, I feel very uncomfortable when I say it and it feels a

bit overly performative.

I'm much more comfortable with what we use here is that mate.

So, "Oh, let me get the door for you, mate."

"Sorry, mate."

You know, mate is the stand in for, because it's more egalitarian.

But funnily enough, we've discussed it on the show and it's like, "Don't you mate me."

We don't have like an, I don't have an equivalent to that.

I'll say that sometimes because I feel like, like I'm not Australian, but I have

friends who are and it's okay.

Like I know it's okay.

All my, some of my greatest friends are Australian.

I, and so I feel like I have a, I have like an inroad to being able to

appropriate or borrow it from time to time.

But then I feel like when I'm chatting to them, they, I like, sometimes I worry

that they're like, "Is he making fun of me right now?"

So then I like, now then I'm overthinking it.

I'm not even referring to you two lovely gentlemen.

I have some mates of mine around here.

See, I have some friends of mine around here who are Australian.

And I want to borrow that because I feel like envious that I, that we don't have a

term like that where I can just like, "Hey Holmes," or "Hey, buddy."

I've tried on a couple of different, they feel like, like ill-fitting gloves.

It's not quite the same at all.

And even if I could pull it off, it's not like a cultural norm.

It's not like a thing that people say to one another.

I, and I wish we had that.

Cause I think that's just a really, it's just a really neat way of referring to a

stranger in a friendly way of giving them a little, giving them a little title like that.

Very handy.

Have you ever tried comrade with a bit of a Russian accent?

I don't know, just kind of throw that out there.

A little bit.

But then, then there was like this black sheath went over my face and I woke up

five hours later in the back of a van and I had a new tattoo that took a while to get

off.

So, I don't think, I don't think that's safe.

Well, that took a dark turn.

Anything else on that, Mark?

Uh, nah, should be right.

Thanks, Jeremy.

Quick PSA for you.

I know this is like top, top of mind for most people.

I just wanted everyone to know that I have found what I consider to be the trifecta of

focal lengths that are perfect for me, which means it's very important for everybody to

know.

So, those three focal lengths.

Can we just, just for those who have no idea what you're talking about, focal length.

What is that?

So, you may have heard of a show called three by two, no, I'm just kidding.

I'm not going to do that.

Photography would be the thing.

We don't, we rarely ever talk about it here.

Almost never.

So, sometimes we need to bring it up from time to time.

Pictures, photos, cameras, things of that nature.

Focal length.

How far is the lens letting you extend your vision without moving your feet

effectively?

And for me now, I have found the golden trifecta of 35, 50 and 90.

And I just wanted to make sure everybody in both hemispheres was aware of this.

If they have further questions, please follow up at focal length at hemispheric views dot com at any

time. And I will answer any questions that you have.

That's it.

I have thoughts.

Oh, sorry.

Go ahead.

Oh, no, it's very quick.

I just think it's very interesting because you have shared this separately, I suppose.

So, I'm just slightly distracted.

Listeners can't see that Andrew's entered a very kind of seductive pose in his bedroom studio.

And the bunny is just kind of, I don't know.

It's interesting.

If anyone has ever seen the picture of like George Costanza, like lounging on the, it's kind of like

that, only possibly a greater state of undress.

Yeah.

Is it a bunny or is it a kangaroo?

It looks like a kangaroo.

This is the chillest podcast recording I've ever seen in my life.

Lounging on a bed with a microphone being held up by a stuffed kangaroo.

My butt was getting numb.

It's also very important for listeners to understand that this is not a euphemism.

There actually is like a stuffed rabbit or kangaroo.

And that's not like, OK, I just wanted to make sure you clarified that for later consumption.

Well, I'm glad that we have this focal length because any closer and it could get a little bit steamy in here.

Anyway, on focal lengths.

No, I just think it's interesting because one of the things that I love about photography is something like a telephoto or a zoom lens that gives you that reach that you can't get out of something like a phone.

But I accept that that's not what everyone's all about.

And this 35-50-90 thing, Jason, you're really into exploring on the street and that sort of thing, right?

You're not out there for bird portraits or that thing's way too far away.

I want to get that. So this is really, I mean, what are each of those?

Can you kind of sum up briefly because I get the vibe you wanted to do a different segment.

Can you sum up briefly what each of those things is for?

Like because they're close, but they're not all the same.

Yep. So 35 is going to be when you are.

I would equate it to if you started in the middle of a city and worked your way out towards the suburbs.

So I would say middle of a city, 35.

You've got tall structures all around you, very close to you.

You've close proximity to people.

You want to have an entire frame of information there.

So 35 is the winner there.

50, you start getting towards the edge of town.

And now you have some things that are lower to the ground, further away, potentially places you can't physically walk to.

But you still want to get to without having to digitally zoom in later.

And then 90 is the least used, but important for when you are getting out now towards suburbs and beyond

into, say, the woods or something where you have an infinite landscape to where at 35 or 50, everything is tiny.

But you want to capture detail of individual objects that are in this huge landscape.

So you have your 90 for that.

So that's my 35, 50, 90 story.

How does that do you?

Good explanation.

I have equivalent lenses like of those lengths, those focal lengths.

But I'm interested by the discipline or the limiting to those three.

So good explanation.

I'm just disappointed that you had what was it, a 35, a 50, a 90, but you didn't have a...

I've written here spouse or spouses enthusiasm for the Mac.

And I wanted to put this in here because people may remember.

In fact, I think she's been a guest on the show before or lent her voice.

My wife, Natasha.

She is someone who I'm proud of the Macness that she's adopted in her life.

And look, I'm going to own up here.

I'm the problem.

I started that.

I'm the Mac fan or tragic, you know, since primary school age and entering this relationship with me.

It was great.

Here's a reality that I have to grapple with.

I feel sorry that she's had to listen to all of this crap over the years, but I'm grateful for it.

But the extra length that she's gone to as a school teacher and is essentially like the IT or iPad administrator for the school is impressive.

And I kind of wanted to, it's probably would have been great if...

Sorry, I just need to interrupt.

I need to do a little translation there.

School teacher, also known as school mom for you in the Northern Hemisphere.

What? I don't think that was a word.

What did you just say?

School mom.

Isn't that what these, you know?

No.

No.

No school teacher would be the one.

Yeah.

In Little House on the Prairie, they had a school mom.

I'm sure they did.

You're aware that that took place like 70 years ago, right?

I'm just trying to help.

I'm just trying to cross all the references because I know sometimes language can be confusing.

I'm sorry if my reference is a little dated.

I think this, I think this conversation is confusing.

I don't know what.

Was that marm, M-A-R-M or mom, like M-O-M?

No, like marm, M-A-R-M, like school mom.

I'm looking at Jason right now.

He's looking at his screen.

And I think all of us, I think we just need to carry on.

I'm sorry.

I'm going to go back on it.

I'm sorry to interrupt.

I was trying to be helpful.

Clearly, all of them.

It's one for the show notes and the Discord, I think, and we can get to the bottom of this linguistic mystery.

I think if you look back to 1865, that may have been a term.

The marm.

Somewhere in the lexicon.

Well, so I just wanted to throw it out there.

Thank you, Andrew.

That there are moments where Natasha comes home with a story or something that happened at work in the realm of the Mac or managing iPads.

And I just go, wow, brilliant.

And I wanted to put it out there after this little example, just to see if you had any examples of where someone in your life or brought a family or a partner like impressed you with their tech skill or knowledge.

And it was something, sounds relatively simple, but concerning preview.

And I think some people like a preview, take it for granted, just open PDFs, JPEGs, whatever.

But she was just telling the story about how people were trying to print things and different grids and all this stuff for schools and displays.

And they were like trying to do things weirdly on a Windows computer.

Or how would you do it on a Mac here?

And she just like walks in.

Let me take care of this.

Boom, boom, boom, print, shortcut, everything perfectly arranged in a grid and then all printed out.

And I just thought I would never, ever have come up with that.

First of all, because I don't have the same working context, but two, I would never have even thought about how to print something using the commands and stuff that she did through preview.

And I was just impressed.

So are there any people in your lives, whether it's a partner, extended family member, whoever, who took some element of your tech interest or something you pushed onto them and impressed you in return?

I'm trying to think, like if I look to like Valerie or something like that, like she's incredibly brilliant and everything.

So there's not really anything I think I could teach her.

Everyone else that I've ever given any kind of Apple stuff, it's always pretty basic items that they're performing.

But I am usually pretty impressed with, and this sounds probably negative, but the ways in which that they find things within the operating systems that I'm like, what is that?

How did you even get to this thing you're talking about that I seemingly have been using for 20 some years and have never seen?

Like, how did you find that?

And they usually don't know how they got there.

So it's incredible to me how, I guess, narrow we get on a lot of stuff.

And even if it's not the maybe best way to do it, it's like, that's kind of how we do the thing.

But then they're like, oh, I just do this other thing.

It's like, oh, shoot.

Wow.

That's okay.

I didn't even know it could do that.

So it's usually things like that that they come up with, I guess, just through not knowing a previous way to do it.

So you're just stuck with, here's sort of a blank canvas and they just find it.

So not really one specific thing, but more that they just find things that they can do in ways that I didn't even know existed, but I'm doing it another way.

Yeah.

I don't really have an example of it, but I'll just say that anybody that can understand and figure out the preview interface is doing better than me.

Because every time I load preview on the Mac, I have NFI what any of those buttons do.

And I'm always like, if I'm trying to edit PDF anyway, I end up with like random text boxes scattered everywhere.

I can't figure out how to remove them.

So I just want to insert my signature.

How do I do that again?

That UI is the most befuddling thing I've ever seen.

So anybody that can use preview, you're doing it better than me.

I'll let her know.

I've only been using it for 20 years.

I can't figure it out.

You know, Stacey told me this story like a few weeks ago that I thought was just so awesome.

I mean, you want to criticize Apple about stuff that's very easy to do, but holy smokes, work in a Microsoft environment.

And that's like next level bonkers bananas.

And she was talking about how the team has had this issue with this thing and it's gone on forever.

And she like hopped on Google, started doing some research, found these obscure forum posts, and then a bit on Reddit.

And she figured out a setting that totally fixed this thing that has been plaguing the team for years.

Like, and it wasn't like one of those like big deal things like, oh, this gets in the way of my work.

It's one of those things that's just sort of constantly annoying.

And it's funny how many people will live with something that is annoying and how few people will just be industrious enough to bother to try and do the research to figure it out.

And I was just super impressed.

And she said, well, it's not that impressive because all I did was search and find the thing and then share it with people.

I said, yeah.

But your whole team of however many people has been irritated by the same thing and none of them did that.

So I think to me, it's not even a matter of necessarily tech savviness.

It's a willingness to consider, hey, how could I move past the I don't like this and into what could I do about it?

And I think that that's a very special trait and characteristic.

And it's super impressed me that she's unsurprising, but it was just super cool that she did that.

And then did that awesome next step too, which is, and then I also shared it with everybody because now she's helped fix the problem for a whole bunch of people, not just herself.

And I think that that's a really wonderful thing to do.

I just want to make another announcement that I have a new best friend.

And I wanted to tell you about it.

It's Taylor Swift, just in case, you know, I don't want to bury the lead here.

Scotty's looking deflated.

I am now one degree of separation from Taylor Swift, which means we are basically best friends.

What is that degree of separation?

Wow.

You're looking at him.

It is not Mark.

It is Martin.

Martin, who is also a photographer, uses an Olympus.

Oh, M dash D space.

E dash M 10 space.

Mark four.

Everybody knows that already.

I didn't even need to go through all that.

Everybody knew that Mark field.

Yep.

Coincidentally or not.

Coincidentally, a certain Taylor Swift uses the exact same camera.

Therefore, I know Martin.

Martin uses the same camera as Taylor Swift.

Roundabout way of saying Taylor and I are best friends now, so you can expect her to be on an episode in the future.

So there you go.

Thanks, Martin.

Yeah, look, I mean, Taylor and I constantly on, you know, subreddits and Instagram discussing our favorite filters with the OMD E M 10 Mark field.

It's it's a great experience.

And look, right now I'm rocking the E M 10 Mark field with my 45 millimeter F 1.8.

Jason, I can tell you're getting a little bit.

It's getting hot over there because that is a 90 mil equivalent and micro four thirds big.

Loving this kind of shorter telephoto reach that I have here.

And look, it's a nice one as well.

Oh, click reverse.

Look at that.

Loving it. And Taylor and I talk about this lens all the time.

So.

So cool.

Yeah. You know, just hop online, become best friends, join micro four thirds or nerds as a community.

That's what we are.

And yeah, besties with Taylor.

Thank you.

And plus, Andrew was asking for a type 45 lens.

And that's what you have right there.

So full circle.

Perfect.

Love it.

Oh, it is tight.

It's exactly what that is.

It's a tight, tight view.

OK.

Before we get flagged for content.

Thank you, Scotty, for joining us on this exclusive super secret Canada edition of Hemispheric Views.

What do we say?

Like, where could people find you on the Internet?

Oh, I like hanging out in the Hemispheric Views discord.

That's some great people over there.

That's pretty great.

Or hey, Scotty Jay dot com is a micro blog, but mostly the Hemispheric Views discord, actually, because I've quit all other forms of social media.

That's less fun.

Excellent.

Love to hear it.

Yeah.

Everybody, if you've not joined, join right now.

It's great.

Lovely people over there.

Andrew, anything else from Studio Bed?

No, Studio Bed is, um, I'm getting a bit sore.

You did get a screenshot of this already, right, Martin?

Just just quickly.

You have it in bed, like fully.

OK.

OK, thank you.

Yeah.

OK.

Yeah.

So my butt got numb.

I've moved to the bed.

I've been lying on my side.

Now my back and elbows getting a bit sore.

So I'm going to tap out in a second.

OK.

Thank you, sir.

Thank you for your service.

Martin, anything else from Studio The Same?

Yes, from Studio The Same.

I'd like to thank Scotty for his surprise appearance.

It's been an absolute pleasure to have you and good to see you like moving, you know, footage.

How about that?

I'm actually here for that now.

And I have one question to ask you, which I think is pretty important in the context of

hemispheres. Scotty, being from Canada, as I know you call it, how does it feel to be more

northern than our regular northern hemispheric representative?

It makes me feel a little bit more qualified, actually.

Thank you.

And three, two.

Your British ambassador is norther, norther than me, isn't he?

We've also got Firsty, who's in Norway, so you can't be any more northern than the country

that actually has nor.

Oh, that's true.

That's yeah.

He's even got nor in the name.

You still got some work to do.

We'll try and push those latitudes higher.

Connell Drift.

I think you can count us down officially now, Jason.

Here we go.

And three, two, one.
