Okay so Jason you tried to vote yourself out of the podcast because Andrew was being me.
I took my little tiki torch candle snuffer and put it over my tiki torch and I have been banished from the island that is the world.
As you know the votes counted are final the person voted out will be asked to leave the trouble counselor immediately I'll read the votes.
Okay.
Jason.
Go ahead.
Jason.
Jason.
That's three votes.
Well, that was unanimous.
I don't recall running Jason.
Jason, time to go.
Well, it was mediocre knowing you both.
And next week on Hemispheric Views, the two Australians go at it.
They did.
And then they don't even get through the whole episode and they both quit and that's it.
(upbeat music)
- So I think someone's put pressure on us here.
Perth Bandits, One Prime Plus member,
he brought up wrestling entrances.
Now I don't feel qualified to actually bring this up,
although I've segued to it.
I think there's a particular man in this show
Who's into wrestling. Jason, you're into sport. Oh, wait, sorry, Andrew, it's you.
The guy we didn't vote out. Yeah, Andrew.
Yeah, you couldn't vote me out because you know I'd chokeslam you both.
And then at the end of that.
I'd triple H you in the face.
Wrestling entrance music.
I don't know, you don't, might not know much about wrestling, but let me just set the scene here for a moment.
Wrestlers, wrestling is performance, entertainment and a sport combined into one amazing show.
But to build the tension, the excitement, wrestlers don't just sort of quickly head
out to the ring.
They have music that sets the tone, sets the scene, tries to say something about the wrestler
as well, their persona or what they're about.
And they will saunter to the ring while this music is playing.
Gets the crowd amped, gets the wrestler amped.
So you need the right kind of music.
Can't just be your favorite song, because your favorite song might be a ballad or something,
that's not really going to work well for wrestling.
- You don't want that.
- You need to have that right kind of music
that just amps everything up
and gets you ready to smash the other guy.
When we think about this,
it's about what works for you and your persona,
who you are.
If you could walk into an office environment
and you just need to be owning that meeting,
you need some entrance music.
If you're walking in after,
walking home after a big day out,
You're coming into the family and you want to say, yeah, I'm here.
Entrance music.
All right.
It's got to fit.
It's got to fit all the things.
You can't pick different music for each one either.
It's got to be the one song for each entrance.
So.
Do you think when like a new wrestler comes onto the scene and they hire the
consultant, they bring them in to do the talk that you just gave, do you think it
goes exactly like that?
Cause I kind of feel like maybe you are a consultant for this space.
I mean, you do consulting for other things, obviously, but.
it kind of feels like this may be a new adjacent thing for you to take on.
It would be new wrestler pep talk for picking their entrance song.
Well, I'm just going to say it up front.
Andrew's always said that he's into, in inverted commas, "business", right?
But he's never really said what that business is.
So maybe he's just been doing wrestling consulting the whole time,
being super modest about it.
Or perhaps Andrew "The Business Canyon" is his wrestling name,
That he does backyard wrestling with people who are in the wrestling industry will often call it the business
It's just an inside term coincidence. I think not there you go there we go
Perth bandits has asked us
To have a think about what our entrance music can be I I put some thought into this and it was it was tough
It was really hard. I went through libraries of songs
I probably spent an hour or so on it and I think I got to a pretty good answer
But I don't know where we want to lead off with this guys.
Well, my first question is, is, are we, do you think it's going to be possible for us to put,
because obviously the length of this I would imagine is not more than 15 to 30
seconds, something like that, right?
Or unless you're triple, if you're triple H, it's a good four and a half minutes because he really worked.
Oh, okay. So the more kind of popular you are, the longer it takes.
Yep. Yep.
Okay. So we can't obviously put whole songs.
So mine's going to take like 30 minutes.
Martin's music has several movements.
Yeah, Martin's entrance album.
Consider it my opus.
Yeah.
So, we could probably put like little snippets in, I would imagine, into the podcast, right?
Once we mentioned them, do you think?
But I think Andrew actually needs to use his wrestling announcer voice to lead into each track.
Oh, my goodness.
Wow.
Okay.
Pressure is on.
He's really putting the pressure on.
So so who wants to leave should I leave with my choice or do you guys.
Love for you to leave off because I am dying to know this feels like a question that you personally have been answering for yourself your entire life.
Multiple times a year you come across a song and you think that's the one that I would pick.
Tell me I'm wrong right you you've been there's been a lot of thought into this your whole life has and there's a big crossover between.
Wrestling and basketball fandom as well so there is there is no limit of that to say I'm sort of in sconce someone in this universe.
Sorry without further ado what I'm going to do I'm actually gonna give you a couple the options that didn't make the cut before I tell you the one that I chose.
Okay I've got three that didn't quite get there for me they were close for the be fun but given my current persona wasn't right so we had first one was I'm.
Boom Bastic by Shaggy.
Wow okay yeah.
Bustic with the fun does it you know you know the one.
I see Andrew I think Shaggy.
My chest hair glistening.
From sweat or chicken grease or soul glow.
Yeah weirdly my zoom plays that as soon as you join the call so.
I guess that one didn't make it and the second one that didn't make it was magic carpet ride.
But by Philip stair so this was a Steppenwolf song I think originally but this one is a different version.
So that is a was another option is pretty funky got a good beat.
I like to be.
Yeah something like that that was the actual sample yeah yeah that was the sample.
I'm realizing now the failure of this whole conversation is that if we don't know the song is really not gonna do it.
We should have just played them live for each other.
But anyway, please proceed.
I should have hooked up my Ferrago soundboard.
That's what I'm saying.
We really should have got those hooked up to the soundboard.
That's unfortunate.
No, I like it this way.
And the last one that didn't make the cut is House and the Rising Sun, House of Pain by House of Pain.
Wow.
Now that one I would sing to you, but I've actually forgotten now how it goes.
But I know it would fit as a wrestling entrance.
Okay.
Okay.
So the first two were not didn't make the cut third one was the that's the one you're going with?
No. So now that. Oh these all didn't make the cut. They all didn't now I'm up to the one
that got it would make the cut. Okay. Okay so I needed a banger. I needed to actually like the
song. Yeah. And it needs to amp me up while amping the crowd up. All right so a few boxes that needed
to be ticked there. Yeah, that's a tall order. Let's see if I can do this. And now introducing
at 190 pounds, six foot four, the phenom Andrew Canyon!
It's dreamer by Voyager.
Of course it is.
Of course.
Okay.
Wow.
That's fantastic.
I don't know what I'm allowed to start talking or what's going on, but I suppose that's it.
I ran in.
I got no other paper right here.
It's got like 80 synth.
Has the big and as that hits you have pyro.
And I give it the big fist up into the sky.
I'm going to order Bieber right here.
Let's do this.
Dreamer by Voyager.
I'm fired up.
I'm ready.
Yeah.
I think the podcast can finish at this point.
That's like the grand finale to all episodes.
I was just waiting for somebody to come through the door and have you just level them.
But I guess that we didn't get that far.
Give me the chair. Chair shot.
What would be your weapon of choice? Would it be a chair? Or would you go with more traditional,
like a two by four? Or would you go like the thumbtack route where it's more complicated,
and a lot of setup? What would be your choice there, you think? Or would you just go no,
nothing, just pure the business canyon, you think?
I love the chair right now there's a classic I'm also partial to trash can.
Yeah the trash cans good.
Okay but I think given that I'm the business I think I need to be a stapler.
Oh wow and just try that you're going to say briefcase but.
Oh that could work to you a briefcase could work.
See I reckon since you're a businessman you are the business it's a great opportunity for you to devise your own signature move called the hole punch.
Nice
Yeah, that could be your thing. Actually you come out you got a tie
So already you got a weapon with the tie you could choke somebody out
Yeah, you got a briefcase full of office supplies that are unto themselves weapons
So you've got you've got a letter opener in there. Maybe that's questionable. That could be probably illegal
Yeah, you've got your stapler going on in there. Yeah, I think there's a lot of room you could get binder clips
Just cover somebody with binder clips. I'm gonna laminate you. Yeah. Oh, yeah hot laminator. That could be good
Stick their hand in there or something.
Then when you've done the hole punch, you pick him up and you throw them out of the ring, at which point that's called the outtry.
Oh, I like that.
Look at that.
Can we fix in a paper cut somewhere in there?
Ooh, yeah, you get them stuck up in the-
In the ropes.
In the ropes.
And then you just paper cut them.
Thousand cuts.
Yeah.
I like the outtry, though.
That's good.
Thousand cuts canyon.
That's what they call them.
Wow.
There we go.
I like that for Andrew, because it's his passion, we've gone beyond the entrance to actually just devising.
The whole thing, we've just-
The whole thing.
The whole match has been scheduled.
I don't have this material for myself.
No, mine will be much shorter.
I will name a song and then we'll move on.
The last good thing about that song is I reckon I could wrangle it so I get the actual rights
to use that song as well.
I was going to say, you have an in for-
Yeah.
Yeah.
At least discounted.
I bet he would give you at least a 10% discount.
At least.
Yeah.
Friends and family.
because we've just devised Andrew's career. I think Andrew needs to introduce each of us,
unless you had more to say, Jason. We'll jump to our things.
I do not have more to say. No, I'm good.
Do you have a preamble like I did and some options or do you just want me to introduce you?
I would love to hear Martin's song is, I think, what I would love to hear next.
Or do you want to intro him?
I'll intro Martin and then-
I will not be introing myself, just to be clear.
I'm happy to be intro guy.
Okay okay feel free.
So after the intro my music will just start.
I think that's the best way to do it.
Yeah let's do that.
Let's do that.
Yeah.
Here we go.
Introducing now the legend of verbiage, the talker of the gong, the wise, the thoughtful, the Eastern European menace, Martin Baaaaaald.
*whistling*
*snort*
*laughter*
You have really been practicing this?
How the f*** did you just do that off the cuff like that?
*laughter*
I'm terri-
And what you just heard, what you just heard was the only song that I could think of which Discord users would have seen already, which is Magic Mamaliga, which was used in Borat.
Magic Mamaliga.
*singing*
I like a disco dance.
Thanks, Andrew. I think you did me justice.
Any menace that was created with the naming of who you are just destroyed by that music.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. They're like, oh, this guy's going to be- Oh, maybe no.
I think-
Why is he wearing a mankini on the right?
Can I change my bet to the other side, please?
I'm a little bit worried.
Man, you just got- I mean, that is quite the introduction.
I have to say.
Yeah.
Thank you.
I'm flat out honored.
Now I feel like I need to figure out where you can get custom action figures
created.
Articulated.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Multiple points of articulation are going to be necessary, but I feel like we need
action figures now.
So if anybody knows where to make action figures that look like your likeness, let
me know.
All right.
Moving on to Jason.
I'm terrified.
See what I come up with.
The challenger into the ring next.
The master of the military.
The strong American hero.
We have your friend, but he's not your friend because he doesn't like people.
We have Jason.
He's your friend, but he's not.
(both laughing)
- Wow.
Excuse me, I'm a little choked up, literally,
from that intro.
So in typical fashion, I have three songs.
- Three songs.
- Because one is not good enough.
And I have it on a rotation based on venue
and based on opponent.
- Ooh, I like this.
- So I have three songs that are different
in respect to the environment.
So first song, if I just need to get hyped,
Slam by Pendulum.
Great song.
- We've spoken about Pendulum before, haven't we?
- Now.
(upbeat music)
There it just went.
See, you're hyped now.
Second one now is when we're gonna do an outdoor event.
It's gloomy.
It's kind of close to Halloween.
So we got that scary vibe going on right now.
It's going to be "Gray" by the 69 Eyes out of Finland.
And that's playing now.
(upbeat music)
- I've never heard that song.
- No, I figured you had not.
And then the third one is just going to be on rotation.
It may be my exit song after I win,
which is 100% win rate.
So we do it.
- Fair enough.
- Take that, Undertaker.
- Yeah, you got nothing.
The King of Rock and Roll by Daniel Lyon,
which is an offshoot of another Finnish band as well.
[MUSIC]
So those are my three songs,
all of which you've heard now.
Yeah, that's it. That's all I got.
I have no other wrestling information.
I have no idea what my thing would be.
I would be curious to know other people's answers to that question.
Yes.
Or if you've even thought about it or if you even know what wrestling is at all,
Because I feel like that's a valid option also.
And just on the last little bit of wrestling entrance music,
the best wrestling song entrance of all time is probably "Sexy Boy."
I... we're hearing that now.
I'm just a sexy boy.
Sexy boy.
I'm not your boy toy.
Boy toy.
I'm just a sexy boy.
I completely agree with you, Andrew, based on what I just heard.
This is killing me.
Edit number two. I'm not so sure about that answer, Andrew. That could not actually be the best one.
So, you can just use whichever one works there.
Hot break kid showing Michaels.
Oh, yeah.
Now, we have some rapid fire announcements.
Rapid fire.
The first one is, this is a year in the making.
Actually, we didn't really do much. It's just a year since it happened last time and it's coming up.
Arcadia June.
Arcadia June.
Who remembers this?
Has it really been a year?
Wow. Isn't that wild? We've been doing this for a year.
It's coming up. For the uninitiated or people who've come more recently, last year,
we had the fantastic game app as a focus for an entire month, Arcadia, which was discovered,
I think Natasha brought it up, and how much she enjoyed it on watch, phone, iPad, all that stuff,
Apple TV, Mac now, it's everywhere. Fantastic app, which is actually developed in Italy. We had one
of the co-developers or co-founders join us on the show. And Jason came up with the idea of turning
it into a competition. You can participate through things like Twitter and micro.blog,
but really all the action is on Discord. And we'd love listeners to contribute again,
take part in the full suite of games that make up Arcadia. And Jason, am I right in saying you
can submit your high scores? I think this time we're going to have a specific channel as well
under games to actually submit scores, and there may be a prize at the end.
There's always a prize at the end here, ladies and gentlemen.
Also, the interesting thing is since last year,
I think there are two, possibly three additional games added to the library.
So it's not even that it's just the same games from last year.
There are new ones.
So we have no scores for these new ones as of yet.
Everybody can compete against last year's scores, which
that's not where the prize is coming, but that's something you can work toward.
But also, there's just more games this time. So I think even more people will find cool games to play.
It gives you an idea of what people were capable of last year, which was insane in a lot of
accounts. I don't know how people got some of the scores they got, but it's all in a shared note.
So I'll put that back in the channel at the top once we open up the new channel and you can see
what happened last year and we'll track it for this year. Yeah, and we'll try and reach out to
developers again of Arcadia and see if we can get their endorsement.
Well, they're in the Discord as well. So we can see if they can pop in as well.
Yeah, Raphael and Irene, thank you for your support last year. We'd
love to have you involved again, talk to some of the different players out there. Of course,
I could say their names with a more Italian accent, but I'd butcher it. So I just went
to the lazy Anglo thing. I apologize. But look, for anyone who didn't take part last year,
or isn't sure what the links are, where the game or the app links could be, check out the links
and show notes, you'll see the app store link for Arcadia. Also join the Discord, contribute your
scores, see if you can win, because I know Natasha has really been looking forward to trying to beat
everyone at Bricko again. She's been practicing all year, right? That was her aim, probably. Yeah,
I think so. She just disappears and comes back and I just see like her watch battery is depleted.
That's the wild thing is she was getting some of these scores on her damn watch,
and it's like, what? How? And Eric was a machine last year too. Eric was at a girl.
Yeah, he abandoned his family for a while and was playing Arcadia like in the woods or something
while they were camping. Like where's Eric? He'd say I'm going for a run,
but really his run was getting on his phone and playing Arcadia.
Exactly. Yeah. So check out Arcadia June, join in, send in your scores. We'll have some fun.
Next announcement. Those who are One Prime Plus subscribers or who have heard of
oneprimeplus.com. It's in the long game. Oneprimeplus.com. Long game. You can make topic
and theme suggestions very much like what Perth Bandits did for the Wrestling Entrances segment
of this very show. We are also extending that for some time this year in 2022 to our Hemispheric
News. Generally, if you follow Hemispheric News, we have different articles that come up. We write
one thing each month. It's kind of like a newsletter extension through craft of our blog,
but personalized. Normally we write about different things, but this time we're opening it up to topics
from listeners. So if you're a OnePrime+ listener and you want to know our view on something or to
see how we might engage with it, send us a topic suggestion in the OnePrime+ Discord members
channel and we're going to tackle those topics. How would I find out more information about
said OnePrime+, where would I go for that? Just in case. There's a URL I think. Is there a URL?
oneprimeplus.com.
That's the one.
Okay.
Just checking.
It works every time.
And can I get to that via hemisphericviews.com?
Yes.
I believe there's a link from there as well.
What if I went to hemisphericviews.au?
Yes, that will work.
Everything's taken.
It's just taken care of.
What all roads lead to oneprimeplus.com.
What about hemisphericviews.us?
Yet again, you're landed right there in the correct location.
Wow.
It's as if this were extensively thought out.
- I think the only one we need to take care of now
is Hemispheric Views.Kazakh.
That would be the only one left, really.
- We tried to get it, but we were banned.
They were like, no.
- It's a very long kind of extension,
like a way to finish a domain.
It's very odd.
- They like a long extension in Kazakh.
- Next announcement, please.
- Anyway, last one, another one Prime Plus thingo to mention.
Of course, we also have our monthly episodes,
sometimes some extra bonuses in there as well.
Keep an ear out for the next One Prime Plus episode
later this month, which is gonna be about journaling.
I think one of us might have a lot to say about this.
The other two may not, but check it out.
So this is gonna be a dedicated topic.
If you're interested in hearing
what we have to say about journaling,
whether that be written, audio, video, love it, hate it,
what do we think?
Check it out there at oneprimeplus.com.
- There is one additional announcement
that is not in the notes that I'm realizing.
I know this is like, here we go. Another announcement. We get it. Principal.
The live watch of severance is going to be happening.
We had a little bit of a scheduling issue on the last one,
but I think we might have a date now.
So yet another one prime plus.com benefit.
Fun thing is a live watch.
We did the live watch of crocodile Dundee at one point.
Now we're going to go through each episode of severance and rewatch all of those
with everybody and break it up with commentary and discussion.
So that'll be coming along as well.
So keep an eye out on,
I think discord really is like the best place for quite literally anything that
we do because it's the most real time, I think.
So check that out. And that is just yet another one prime plus.com benefit.
And I have done good authority that the goats are now ready.
Perfect. Perfect.
Martin I recently made a note referring to Apple products backlinked to music backlink to dreamer by Voyager and the ultimate.
Link that I was back linking everything to was this product called the iPod.
I then had to put a little emoji cemetery next to it because it's dead what do we think.
Very sad can I preface that real quick everybody says the iPods dead now I would argue it's been dead for a while I don't think the iPod touches an iPod.
Discuss well I put in name but not necessarily in physical click wheel style but does that mean would you argue.
We don't want to cut down a huge tangent here, but does that mean that you would argue that
something like the touch versions of the iPod Nano models weren't iPods?
No, those were iPods. A dedicated music player, and that's all it did is an iPod.
Shoving an iPod functionality into another device does not make it an iPod.
Sure. No, I think that's a fair view.
I just think there's all this like, "Oh my God, the iPod's dead." And it's like,
it's kind of been gone for quite a while, and no one's cared about it in quite a while,
even though there's been an iPod Touch.
So yes, in name it's now gone, but I would say as a product it's been gone for quite
a long time.
So you think ClickWheel represents iPod?
Is that kind of where you're going?
I don't even think the interface matters.
I think it's just the functionality of the device.
I mean, when it stopped functioning as just being a music player and it was quite literally
just a screen that did what an iPhone did without the phone part, why is that an iPod
any more than an iPad being an iPod.
It's the same thing.
It's just a smaller iPad.
So I don't know.
It's like, and I'm not saying that like,
I don't like the iPod.
I'm just like, I find it interesting
that it took this for people to be like,
oh, the iPod's gone.
When it just feels like it's been gone for a very long time.
- Yeah, I think it's more wrapped up in nostalgia
and the name and the fact that it was generally in the line.
But yes, technically, and in terms of design and use,
you're right, the iPod is like a tiny iPad or vice versa.
Yeah, I think it's, saying a sad time is maybe a little bit dramatic, but you know, you can't
help but kind of think, you know, we all had good memories with this product and it's probably
one of my favourite, if not favourite, product lines that Apple's ever done, purely because
of the focus.
As you said, Jason, it was a dedicated music player.
I like the fact that, you know, with the HomePod now, also discontinued, so we'll say HomePod
There's a degree of focus that you get from it.
It's a device that's about pleasure
and consumption of media.
Whereas, I love the Mac and the iPhone and all this stuff,
but work can kind of interfere in a way,
different things, expectations, social media, and so on.
These are the things that are now,
things of the past carry more of a nostalgic
or media consumption angle,
a kind of focus that you don't necessarily get
with other things.
So I think that's what we're kind of saying goodbye to
in a way.
I didn't I didn't allow you all to prep for this but I was curious if you had to pick your top three iPods
Was that something you'd be able to do off the top of your head? Yeah. Yeah, Andrew go top three iPods. I pod with video
Hmm number one iPod touch number two. Sorry Jason. Hmm and
iPod shuffle. Oh, just a little clip little clip one like the first clip one or the one that was more
rectangular with the aluminum colors.
Not the gumstick one.
No, no, you're right. The aluminum colors.
The aluminum one. OK.
I had a green mint, sort of a mint green one.
I really enjoyed it.
And Martin, what would be your top three?
I know they're sitting right next to you, obviously.
Yeah, I'm looking at things on the shelf right now.
I like all of Andrew's answers because I like iPods and I continue to use my mod pod and love that kind of iPod video.
Oh, right. - Version.
I love, the iPod video is great.
I suppose that's the realization of the extent
or the potential or the maximum use
of a classic kind of iPod.
- Which one is your Mod Pod again?
It's like the fifth gen or?
- I've got it here just one moment and we'll screenshot it.
- Is it the iPod video?
I forget which one it is.
- Yes, so it's a modified black iPod video.
- Right, okay.
- Which had a new back put on it.
It also has like a third party click wheel on it,
which is rough to the touch rather than smooth.
And it's had the full hard drive replaced by a 128 gig SD card.
So the whole thing feels light.
It's bizarre.
- Oh, that's weird.
- It's this sort of...
- Did they do anything different with the battery
or is it the same?
Is it a 30 pin?
That's a 30 pin, right?
- Yeah, 30 pin, they replaced the battery.
So it's an iPod,
but there are enough little modifications
and third party elements that it feels like a kind
of bizarro world iPod,
but obviously without an HP logo,
'cause that's unacceptable.
(laughing)
- Oh yeah, if anybody said the HP logo,
I was gonna kick you off the call immediately.
- Anyway, the three that are probably my favorites,
even though I love all of them,
I think Andrew, you're right, the Shuffle's cool.
To me, the ones that are most iconic
or that I like the look of the most would be the iPod mini.
I love the iPod mini.
I love the way it feels in your hand,
that curved aluminium around the sides.
That was my first iPod.
Second of all, I love the look
of the first generation white iPod Nano.
I think that's classic and just pulling it out of that pocket that apparently had an
unknown purpose for decades prior to its filling with the iPod.
Yep.
But to me, the most classic iPod, the one that defines the look and everyone's memories
of it is the fourth generation iPod in white, which was the first one to get the click wheel
after the iPod Mini's introduction.
So this was before you could include iPod photo and this one went to color LCD, but
This is the square-ish shape iPod screen
without the kind of enhanced wide version.
And we're talking like the Chicago font.
- Yep. - Got it.
- That's probably my favorite look.
- So wait, Andrew, was one of your favorites
your first iPod or no?
- Yeah, I was late to the iPod train
'cause I was never hugely into music.
So the iPod with video was my first one.
- Oh, wow, okay.
- I just kept holding off.
- That's like about 2006, I think, '05, '06.
You would have got it '07.
- That sounds about right.
Yeah, I could just remember, I can remember my life. I remember going to work with it.
And I listened to podcasts a lot with it as well, because I still wasn't into music hugely.
A lot of Adam Curry podcasts, Leo Laporte, I think I listened to.
It was probably my first great toilet device.
Had the Brick Breaker game on it, right?
Yeah, yeah, it did.
I never really played the games.
Since you talked about it being a toilet device, I have a very specific question for you, Andrew.
Let's say you were- - now, this sounds like a hypothetical, but I want to know a genuine answer if this happened.
You're busting to go to the toilet.
Could be number one, could be number two.
It's going to have to be number two, actually, because you're sitting down with the iPod.
Did you ever have a situation where you were busting?
It was, you know, right at the door, but you were waiting for a podcast or something to sync to the iPod before you could go to the toilet?
No, I don't recall it.
I was always pretty well organised, so that thing would have been synced overnight.
Yeah, sure.
So, you were planning your podcasts for your next day number two.
Yes. You got to plan ahead.
Wow, that's intense.
Nothing's done on improv basis around here.
Wow. So, your bowel movements follow a planned work calendar.
That's very impressive.
Yes. They're always 45 minutes apart.
As long as time is the only thing you're blocking, Andrew, that's good.
That sounds very healthy.
I'm happy to hear that.
Now I have an announcement to make.
I have just bought an iPod.
Like while we were talking?
No, not while we were talking prior to this episode.
But yeah, I bought an iPod.
Oh, OK. What did you buy?
Wait, can we guess? Can we guess?
Let us guess. You bought the OG
first iPod, like the Firewire original OG one.
You're half correct. I already have that, but I didn't just buy it.
Damn it. Was it 2002?
It's the first gen, but the slightly different storage capacity.
And you're doing a guess young and I guess you bought that stupid one with no buttons.
All the one with voice over the silver shuffle that looks like yeah I forgot to do some buttons like a weird little space missile that everybody hated because there's no way to control it.
Both good guesses I actually bought the last ever iPod the iPod touch 32 gigabyte blue back white front as a semi nostalgia but also for Mac.
You bought it for Mac. Correct. I bought it for Mac. Thought so. I hadn't planned to do this,
but Natasha was like, well, you're going to buy an iPod now, aren't you? And I went,
hmm, that's a good idea. I was given the excuse to buy an iPod. So thank you, Natasha. But I
thought, look, it's already kind of old. Who knows what the operating system updates are going to be
like and support in the future. But I thought the value of the iPod Touch, despite Jason's
correct point that it's kind of more than just music, is that it is this kind of all round
pocket computer when you don't want to have a phone. Great for people who are kids or don't
want all of that overhead or happen to be a waiter and want to carry that around with them to take
orders or something. I don't know. But I thought, you know, kids these days, they constantly end up
taking phones from their parents. Kids these days.
Kids these days. And it's like, how do you manage that when it's your own device? I'll give it back.
They break things. Get a little iPod. It's not that expensive, really. You know, if you can afford
it's fine. Stick a case on it. And when he's that little bit old enough, it's a bit of a controlled
parental guidance or kicking off digital literacy. So, I thought I may as well get it. And even if
it's useless in the future, it's something for the collection.
You can put Arcadia on that.
You can.
Exactly.
Get him started now.
Yeah, get him on the leaderboard.
Anyway, I don't know how shocked you are that I bought one, but I appreciate the guesses.
I'm not shocked.
No, in hindsight, obviously, I'm not surprised. It just didn't occur to me. Because I know they
they sold, they kind of sold them all out pretty quick,
which was interesting.
I don't know if that means there just weren't that many
to begin with, or I assumed everybody bought them up.
Like you said, people use them for like point of sale
and stuff like that.
So it was probably like, oh crap,
we better get like a bunch more of these as backups
just in case so we don't have to change
our whole infrastructure that's built around iPod touches.
But cool.
All right, there you go.
You got a new iPod.
Do they still have the little pop out thing
where you put the little wrist strap on it.
Is that still a thing?
- No, I think that was the sixth gen.
'Cause it moved to seventh, I think they might've got rid of it.
- That was a really satisfying button that you would push,
it would pop out to have the little loop thing go on it.
That was nice.
I always wanted that on my phone, on the iPhone,
'cause I thought that'd be nice to have
to attach it to things, but never got it.
- Tim Cook's excited 'cause another skew has bit the dust.
- Yep, there you go.
In his never ending quest for supply chain optimisation.
Goodbye, iPod.
I kind of feel like the base iPad is now the slot that was filling what was, or the iPad mini.
Yeah, that's fair.
Fill the slot of what the iPod Touch was at this point.
Yeah.
I imagine eBay prices for iPods probably skyrocketed after that announcement, just from people remembering that iPods were a thing at some point and thinking, I should get one of the old ones.
And I'm sure the prices went way up.
I think old iPods on eBay actually took the record for the most number of blurry
preview photos.
Definitely.
Especially when they have the Chrome back, just so you can't see how incredibly
scratched they are.
They're like, oh, there's your photo.
Just shake the crap out of the camera.
I just had a spasm the moment I took the photo and I cannot take another one.
One photo per device.
Sorry, can't do it.
Yeah, I can see that.
So speaking of devices small handheld devices the iPod was one there's a new one on the scene the Zune
Microsoft Zune yes in poop brown. I love that one favorite. No this one's in hemispheric views yellow
I hate you. It's made by panic a company based in Portland Portland, Oregon. Yeah, Jason
I think you which went down to the panic office
You changed their sign and while you were there you picked up a play date. Is that right? Yep. Yep went down to have
Coffee and lunch with my good friend close friend cable down at panic very close
We've been known each other for more years than I can count
He may say differently, but yes, I have a
Playdate the long-awaited
long-anticipated
Weird quirky little yellow square device that quite literally has no
Nothing you could compare it to I don't think there's really anything like it
and it sucks that they are so hard to get and I understand that so I'm
I'm sad that not everyone can just get one when they want one
But I know there's a lot of people that are still on the list and they are shipping I can confirm because I do have
one and I don't want to do a long you know Verge article on it or anything like that
but is the Verge is this little thing actually am I dating myself? I think it's still there. Okay. I
think everybody left all the all the people who you used to know from it left but it's still there.
They're at Google now yeah. Oh okay well you know one of those things that writes long blog posts
about stuff. Yeah the playdate I just wanted to touch on a couple of things regarding the device.
First of all, the experience, the out-of-box experience is magical and delightful, as you
would expect from a company like Panic.
Every single detail was thought through, from the packaging to the presentation of the device
in the packaging.
I think I posted pictures online, I can put them in the show notes too, of what that looked
like.
But it's just, it was an overly fun and exciting thing to open.
I did get the little flippy case on it as well,
which is delightful.
The couple of things that I wanted to just touch on
real quick were a couple of games.
So if you do happen to have a Playdate,
well actually I should do this in reverse order,
side loading, I know that's a big hot topic
for everybody right now in terms of devices.
The side loading experience on the Playdate
is really, really cool.
What you do is you have your Playdate account online,
you know, play.date, you sign in,
and you have all your stuff that shows what devices you have,
what simulators you have if you're a developer and so forth.
And then there's side loading through the web.
So you literally just drag your little files on there,
which coincidentally are .pdx files,
which is like the most genius thing ever,
because pdx, for those that don't know,
is basically Portland.
The airport code's pdx.
Everything's known as pdx in Portland.
So there, I think it's basically Playdate,
I assume it's just Playdate X,
so it's .PDX is the extensions,
which is just like, it's such a nice little
appropriate touch for a company like that.
But anyway, you drag your little files in there.
It does have Wi-Fi, the device has Wi-Fi.
So as soon as you turn it on and go to your games library,
it checks for new games that are available
because they're released on a seasonal basis.
So every week you get two new games in the season.
and it'll also check for your side loads
and then you can automatically download
your side loaded games and then they're on your device
and you're ready to go.
You don't even have to plug it in to side load stuff
which is just, it's super cool that the side loading
was thought of something ahead of time
not as an afterthought which I think is very cool.
Bloom is the first game I wanted to mention
which is a, it's kind of a storytelling life simulator thing
that's done through like text messages
with friends and family.
You basically left school, you ditched school,
didn't tell your parents,
you're starting this store on your own,
and everything's handled through text messages basically.
And it's done very, very well.
It's a third-party thing, side-loaded,
it was 10 bucks, 10 bucks well spent.
It's just a really high-quality game.
I was super engaged with this thing all the way through.
I just finished it the other day.
So, definitely get that.
And then one of the games that was included,
casual birder, which is just hilarious and fun to play. So that one just comes with it.
Sounds right up Martin's alley. I wonder if Babs is featured.
Exactly. Yeah. It's everything about it is just joy and fun. There's been nothing about it that's
been bad. The screen is unlike any screen I've ever seen. It's not backlit, which I know. I
think that's been the main, I won't say complaint, but thing that people have talked about is it's
it's not backlit.
I think it's fine.
I don't know.
I don't really have an issue with it.
As long as you have adequate lighting,
it's completely usable.
Makes the battery last a lot longer too, I'm sure.
But the screen is just so cool.
It's almost like E-ink crispness, but not slow.
- Oh wow.
- So I don't know what this little screen is.
If I remember right,
the reason that this device even exists
is because I think they found the screen first
and then it was like,
we need to make a thing with this screen.
Something to that effect.
I don't know if I'm getting that absolutely correct, but I think the screen was kind of like the main component that everything else was built around.
And of course, there's.
That adds to the quirkiness of the whole thing.
That's great.
It's like a weird widescreen.
Maybe it's 16.9, maybe slightly shorter.
The elephant in the room is the crank, which every game I've played so far uses it very, very well.
It absolutely seems like a gimmick, but it completely works as a game mechanic.
It's not something you would expect.
And that's maybe one of the best things about it is it's just so unexpected.
Speakers, awesome, great sound quality.
I'm very much looking forward to the little dock that it attaches to.
And it has like a pool.
The pen holder.
Pool suite.
Is that what it's called?
Pool suite.
Pool suite FM.
It's going to have that on there.
So, you just put it on this little dock thing and it becomes like a Bluetooth little desk speaker thing with like a pen cup.
Pool suite, great for the 80s vibe with the music.
music yeah it's just really really good the Tokyo station or whatever it is if
anyone hasn't tried pool suite FM you have to do it even just the logo I yeah
all of it it seems like a match made in heaven it really does so it's just it's
a delightful device it took a long time to get here given all the things that
went wrong I don't think they made a single sacrifice in the build quality or
materials the question I had about the build quality because it looks
delightful on screen on their website.
It looks amazing.
Is it, does it really feel that amazing?
It feels so incredibly premium.
This thing, I don't see one single area where a corner was cut and given the
price, which obviously like it's not, you know, it's not $20, but I honestly,
I'm sorry, I don't remember exactly how much it was now, but given the price,
I am actually shocked that there were no corners cut
because like the crank is like milled aluminum,
which is super high quality.
The plastic is perfect.
The screen is gorgeous.
The tolerances of everything fitting together, amazing.
I know not everyone's a gamer,
but a big thing with game devices
is like the tactile feel of the buttons.
And a lot of times they're squishy
and just kind of mushy and gross.
these buttons feel perfect.
And I think a lot of that comes from the people
that made this appreciate games
and understand what it takes to be a good game system.
So I can't say enough about it.
The little case is great.
The little flippy case, magnets shut to protect it.
It's smaller than I thought.
I guess I would say that.
I thought it was bigger.
- Does it feel like the love child
of a Game Boy and a Fat Nano?
- Kind of, yeah, I could see that.
Ironically, I did put something on there
that lets me play Game Boy ROMs.
That was a third party side.
I actually have Game Boy games.
- Really? - On here.
- I'm very excited to hear all of this
'cause I ordered it really quickly like you did,
but I was stuffed up by the address issue.
Anyway, no hard feelings.
They really fixed that up.
So good on you, Panic.
I think mine's coming sometime
before the halfway point of the year,
but I'm hearing all of this from you.
It's great.
Very pleased to hear.
- I'm very pleased to be able to tell everybody
that the wait is absolutely worth it
'cause I know it's that much worse
when it takes, because I think it was originally 2020
when this was supposed to happen,
I think, if I'm remembering correctly.
So it's been a while.
And so you kind of think, oh, geez,
like the hype has gotten so high.
Can it match that?
And I would say it absolutely does.
I mean, just the other day.
- And look, they've communicated about it.
They've honestly put care for their customers first
because they've said, look, we tested stuff.
There were stuff ups and we're not gonna ship that.
So hold your horses. - No, I think that's fantastic.
Good things come to those who wait.
- If I would have received a unit with a battery
that was crap and didn't work, that would have sucked.
And I also would have not had a unit that worked.
So I would have been no better off.
- That's right.
- Just real quick, the last thing I noticed,
I had it sitting on my desk the other day
and the little power button on the top,
I didn't even notice has a little LED in it.
And when I got my two new games for the week,
it just did this little purple flash every so often.
- Oh, that's nice.
- Letting me know that new games had arrived.
And it's just like every little piece of it.
- Like a Blackberry.
Yeah, exactly. You have a new message. So, here you go.
So, I can't remember what your rating system is, Jason, but what do you give it?
What is my rating system? I think, let's see.
It's eyeballs, isn't it?
I think it's, is it eyeballs?
Oh, yeah.
It might be eyeballs, yeah. I would give this probably like 85 eyeballs.
Out of?
Out of 5.
Wow. That means we need a Cyclops.
Okay.
That's an odd number of eyeballs. We need a Cyclops to help us out.
play date, it's really good. Is it a conversation of like,
do I get a switch or a play date? No, it's not.
That's not what we're talking about here. So it's,
I think it would be unfair to say to like put it against other consoles and say,
should I get this or that it's in a different league of its own in terms of what
it does. And the fact that it is so pocketable,
I love that.
Should we ever go outside again in the future that I can just throw it in a
pocket or throw it in my bag and just play on it a little bit and then shut it when I'm
when I'm done. So it's really cool. And oh, also when I said it was like E-ink, the screen
stays on and shows you things the whole time. So that's where the E-ink comes in. I don't
know if it's like a crazy refresh rate thing that it can go down to like one frame a second
or something, but highly recommended all around 85 eyes out of five stars.
Media Corner.
I reckon we can get through this quickly. Sure.
Yeah. Andrew, have you seen it yet? Nope.
No intention.
You're not going to.
No intention.
Okay.
No interest whatsoever.
Batman.
Uh, I'm sorry.
Spoiling it.
I don't like it.
Don't like Batman.
Don't like the character.
Oh, just flat.
Really?
You don't like Batman?
Don't like him.
It's the only superhero I find palatable.
Wow.
No, never liked it ever since that camp.
This is why we have hemispheric view.
Camp 60s TV show ruined it for me forever.
Oh, love it.
Why doesn't Batman dance anymore?
Freaking hate Batman.
Simpsons? No? Okay, move on. So, Jason, you added this to the notes.
Yeah.
Are we spoiling things? We're just speaking generally, maybe not? We'll be kind to listeners?
Yeah, I think mostly general. I don't think there's going to be any real
spoilers that I can think of, mostly because I don't remember things that I watched. So,
it would be mostly vague.
Well, it was also long.
It was very long. Yeah, so it was three hours.
Another reason not to watch.
Two hours, 50 whatever, which immediately I was like, "Oh, do we even hit play?"
because I'm telling you a three hour movie, that can be dangerous.
But we did watch it.
Andrew had planned his toilet breaks for sure.
We watched it.
I don't know. I guess it was last weekend, maybe.
I don't remember.
I think I texted you guys or maybe I texted Martin.
I don't remember. Yeah.
Where do I begin?
So, yes, it was three hours, which was scary, I have to say.
But I was actually refreshingly
surprised at what I thought a good job they did with this movie. First of all I
was really happy that it was just something different in the back. Let me
back up real quick preface I'm not like crazy hardcore I love superhero stuff
I'm a nerd but like I'm not gonna be the one that's gonna like nitpick oh this
doesn't meet canon or like I don't care honestly I just like I just want a good
entertaining movie. So I was super thrilled that they like somehow went
back in time and were able to get Trent Reznor to play Batman in this movie. I
thought that was really cool. But the whole movie was just not like any other
Batman. So it wasn't this like super buff, I have a bajillion, jillion dollars and
like everything is just like I buy my way out of everything with tech. I guess
what I would say is it was like a superhero movie as if it were quote
Real life as close as you could get to that where the people felt real
You know when you look at characters in Batman like the penguin you got this like guy
Waddling around like he's a penguin going like where where where like it's like comical bullshit
Where this was just kind of like he's the penguin but like he's just kind of this
gnarly dude that could just be a normal person and
And everybody in the movie was basically like that,
where it was just like, it was superhero meets real life
as much as you can say, yeah, of course,
you know, if somebody got hit like that,
they're gonna die and they're not gonna just get up
and walk away, but it's a movie.
So you gotta give it a little bit of that movie credit.
- It had a bit of a DIY angle.
It was a bit grittier.
- Yeah, yeah, it felt more,
I guess true to life is the best way I could describe it,
just in terms of you're like,
oh, that could, given a little bit of latitude,
that could sort of almost maybe be a thing
that's possible, maybe.
So I thought that was really cool, the way they did that.
And I thought the story was actually good
in the sense that it wasn't a three-hour story.
It felt more like a bunch of little stories
kind of built up into a whole overall narrative,
which I think helped, I think for you,
especially Andrew, and for me as well, like I'm not a three hour movie person,
but the fact that it wasn't,
we're going to tell you one thing over the course of three hours,
it was more like we're going to give you a bunch of little slices of what's
going on over the course of three hours.
It didn't feel like three hours at all to me, honestly.
So I thought that was really cool as well. I don't know.
Maybe I'll stop there and see what was your take on that?
Was any of that kind of in line with what you're thinking, Martin,
or are you coming from a different angle?
I won't spoil it for people. I suppose I'd say it in a brief list of pros and cons. What I really
liked about the film was its presentation. I thought I would probably say that my favourite
Batman era would be the Christopher Nolan stuff. I think that was probably my favourite Batman
representation. People can disagree if they want. But this was really, really dark. There's almost
no sunshine but for a bit of sunrise or sunset that peaks through just before they cut it out
of the edit. Everything is really, really dark. Villains feel truly evil. There's that kind of
real aspect that you were saying, Jason. It feels more like serial killer vibes in this than
theatrical, you know, pantomime person. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't scary. The movie wasn't scary,
but the thought that these people could be more closer to reality was like, oh, wow, that's like.
Yeah. And I think the villain being the Riddler in this film, the way that they did that and all of
the people who follow him or become involved with him, the real life element you have there is
troubled youth or people with serious kind of issues. You can look at it and go, wow,
we've seen this with internet culture or social media and live streaming stuff and people who
develop these sick manifestos. It's like, wow, I could see that happening. So presentation,
visually, I thought the music was pretty engaging. Those themes and the realness of the characters,
very good. I think the things that were maybe cons or negatives were it did go for a bit too long,
and I like long movies, but there was just a bit too much padding or silence between things. And I
like silence if it builds tension, but you could have easily shaved 20 minutes of this film and
still had a very engaging story. It was slightly convoluted at points, not to the point that it
was hard to follow or difficult to understand but kind of I found meandering or trying to do a bit
too much so shave it off a bit maybe add a little bit more sunlight here and there just to show that
the sun exists and yeah that would be good. I thought Andy Serkis was quite good as Alfred
he seemed like a kind of concerned father figure more than a butler that has been the case in some
previous films but yeah I think overall it was good I'd like to see them make a shorter sequel
if they continue. However, with all of this review, I would kind of wrap it up and say,
this film, as with others, isn't really necessary. And maybe Hollywood should explore some different
avenues or themes because the superhero thing is getting a little bit tired in my view.
I'd like to see some comedies again, if Hollywood can bust that out.
Yeah, a romantic comedy even.
Because I grew up on comedies. I just remember all of these funny Hollywood films that came out.
And now I see more comedy coming out in foreign language stuff than the US.
Everything's been so Marvel crazed.
And now DC is trying to cobble something together to make it the same.
Let's just have something different.
So good film, some pain points, but I would just like the industry to do something different.
Yeah, I think to your point of cutting stuff out, there was one scene that,
you know, I said that it felt very real in, you know, air quotes of superhero stuff.
But there was one scene, and I'm pretty sure there's not a spoiler, but he effectively
flies off of a building as Batman does, and kind of just gets wrecked, like hits a thing,
bounces off another thing. It added absolutely nothing to the movie,
except for the fact that it was the one place where it just made it feel so incredibly fake.
Everything felt like almost achievable if you're just the right kind of special person.
Yeah.
Then you did that scene, it was just took me completely out of it like, oh, we're back in
Wile E. Coyote hits the brick wall kind of thing and then walks away. And it was just like-
I remember that scene and I agree with you. And I'm not a CGI specialist or a visual effects
supervisor, but it was that one point in the film where they had to rely heavily on something to do
with CGI and the motion didn't seem quite right. And yeah, it removed me from the film as well.
And it felt like you spent a half a million dollars on that scene and felt that it had
to stay in because you spent so much or something.
Delete it.
But other than like it served no purpose because I thought that scene was going to lead up to
he is human and now he's like in the hospital or something and like has like broken neck or
like has to heal. He just walked away and I was like oh I thought this was going to be like a
life lesson of you know you think you're superhuman but you're not.
Oh no actually you are superhuman yeah go ahead just keep going so I was like.
If you're going to do a scene like that, then the movie has to be more Nolan style or Val Kilmer, rubber nipple.
Exactly.
You know, oh, he's got the tech. We believe it. We've accepted the premise.
If it doesn't have Arnold as Mr. Freeze, you can't be doing those kind of scenes. Okay.
We got to cut it out.
So.
Oh, now, just you saying Mr. Freeze there. I feel like that's a nice segue into Andrew's wrestling world.
Honest thoughts on Mr. Freeze, Andrew. What do you-
Just leaving the Batman for a second. What do you think about Mr. Freeze?
Well, I've never seen him because I've never watched that Batman movie.
I failed big time I thought he would have seen it damn it I thought if anything if he's gonna see any Batman stuff it's gonna be Mr Freeze because he has like discs.
I think the only Batman movie I have seen was that one with Christian Bale that was good.
Was that Batman Begins because that was the first of that Dark Knight trilogy.
Those are the Nolan ones right.
Yeah that were Nolans.
I think I watched the first I definitely watched the first one I think I watched the second one and didn't bother with the third and that was about the only probably the only Batman movie I've ever watched sorry.
Don't like Batman.
That's all right.
Don't take offense.
Do your kids like Batman?
No.
No.
Is that because you forcibly made them not like Batman?
Yeah, I don't allow it in the house.
You keep it away.
Okay.
Yeah, that's fair.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I think it was.
I thought it was a pretty good movie.
Actually, I was pleasantly surprised.
I went in with very low expectations.
So.
Same.
Yeah.
I would give it three feet out of five.
Okay.
Wow.
Loses two for length and convoluted presentation, but yeah, three for visuals and creativity.
I will say that I will watch whatever the next one is, because it's very clear there's going to be another one.
I mean, it's Hollywood, of course, there's gonna be another of everything, but I would give the next one a shot.
Well, we were just saying in our family that there needs to be another Simpsons movie.
And I think I think it should be and maybe they call it the Batman.
And then I would watch it.
Why not?
We could do that.
Well, El Bato rises.
If there's one thing that Hollywood likes to do, it's to shove the word rises into the name of a sequel film.
Like a phoenix, it will rise again.
[Music]
Look at that! We've done the whole thing within the time that I have to go.
Now just get, gotta edit this down to half the length it's actually taken.
Woo!
Oh shite. Anyway.
