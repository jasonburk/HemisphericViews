So here we are, episode two.
Yes.
I'm changing this whole setup, by the way.
This is all getting ripped down and changed.
I hate all of it.
What's wrong with it?
I don't like this microphone.
It's way too sensitive and it just picks up...
A spider could be outside three houses down and I'm hearing it on the recording.
It looks a little bit like if you took a microphone, turned it horizontal and made it into like
a, you know, the Men in Black deneuralizer or neuralizer, whatever it's called.
It looks like some sort of weapon.
It's pretty intense.
Pretty much.
It's like that, but instead it's for picking up all audio on the planet at once.
Jason, I've invested far too much time over the last little while reading about microphones
and all that kind of stuff.
And so you have a condenser microphone and what you really want is a dynamic microphone
with a cardioid polar pattern?
Yes, and it's coming in the mail tomorrow.
Oh, is it?
Yeah, everything's coming the day after we're recording this week, which is perfect.
So this podcast is costing you a fortune.
Pretty much, yeah, but it's worth it.
So are you going to tell us what you bought or is it a secret?
Until next episode.
Well, let's get it all in and see if any of it even was remotely worth it, and then maybe
we'll go from there.
I don't want to divulge too much too soon.
Well, the question that I have, all these deliveries that you're having, they're driving
through fires.
Is that the case?
Fires at the moment surrounding you?
Yeah, so a lot of fire.
The West Coast is basically fire right now.
It's been really bad.
It was really bad even when we left California months ago and we came north and it was seemingly
fine and then everything kind of caught up to us.
So like last week we had just terrible, terrible smoke and fire everywhere.
It seemed every county around where we're at was being evacuated.
I know I saw a bunch of people even on micro.blog that are in the Oregon area getting evacuated
and just fire everywhere.
We didn't have to, fortunately.
But the smoke and the air quality here,
I'm guessing AQI is a worldwide thing, or maybe it's not.
I don't know.
But normally, our levels here are in the 20s.
And during all the fires, everything--
our high, at my house anyway, was like 560, I think.
So really awful like where the scale just stops but the number keeps going so
not ideal for
Breathing or uh living in general, but it's been better now
So there's no imminent danger or you know threat threat to your lives your family lives
Anything like that do you never say never I guess but as as of right now, I mean we keep watching all the the various
sources of information which
honestly aren't that great. It's making me kind of come to realize that our systems of
the internet, you know, giving information and disseminating stuff to everyone is really not
that great and kind of horrible actually, considering all the technology we have.
But so far, everything says, nope, you're good, no need to evacuate, nothing like that. So
just got to keep an eye on it. We had the same sort of horrible fire situation at the beginning of
this year and end of last year in Australia, at least on the east coast. You could jump in
Andrew and say what it was like on your side, but in Australia I know that we've always relied on
the ABC, that's the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, radio for really timely updates.
So I'm not actually sure how many people would rely on the internet here in Australia with the
the intense bushfires that we have, we've always just relied on the radio. Do you do
the same, Andrew, on the West Coast? Yeah, the radio is generally considered to
be the peak or the primary source of information and they will, because it's a government funded
organisation, their mandate is to inform the public in situations like that and so they
have a whole range of different warnings that they will push out on a regular basis depending
on how catastrophic things are getting.
Um, yeah, and people rely on that.
And I think because so much of Australia, the fire prone areas don't
have the greatest internet anyway.
Um, and radio waves will get through when telephone poles and stuff have been burnt
down.
Yeah.
I remember the bushfires.
That was crazy.
Uh, and I even remember when it was happening, it felt very much like you
fall into that certain scenario where you're like, that, that, that's a crazy
that could never happen here and well here we are. Yes unfortunately climate
change, global warming, is a international problem and we're all
suffering. Yeah I mean it's like with this kind of stuff happening I'm not
gonna get into that thing right now but wow it's just seems pretty obvious but I
But I guess obvious things are hard to see sometimes for certain people.
Yeah, it's just that extreme variation and how far the weather can go.
Because where I live, we've always lived on a narrow coastal strip right next to the sea,
sort of with a border of mountains that holds all the wet weather in.
And all the dry stuff is generally over those hills, over those mountains.
And now to see orange skies, smog, horrible stuff from bushfires in summer, which we never
really had in our area before, you think, yeah, there's definitely a bit of a global
shift happening.
Now, you guys are on opposite ends of the country.
Was it pretty equal on both sides or was it more prevalent east-west in the middle?
It was much worse on the east coast of Australia.
We had a few spot fires and outbreaks but certainly nothing too far out of the ordinary.
We kind of expect something every summer.
So for us it wasn't catastrophic but for the East Coast, more in Martin's region of the
world, it was disastrous.
Yeah, and to be fair Andrew with the way that Australian news bias goes it could have been
five times worse on your side and they still would have focused on Sydney.
And so it goes.
Yeah, but well, I'm glad that you're, I'm glad that you're relatively well, that you're
breathing, uh, smoky, but yeah.
Yeah.
That is able to keep you alive and that you're not in any immediate danger.
That's that's good news.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Like I said, when we left California, we were, we were worried about everyone there, uh,
with the fires when we were heading out and then it kind of quickly reversed to everybody
saying, you know, wow, you just moved in and now you're on fire.
I was like, yeah, well, you know, that's how things go sometimes.
So I reckon we get stuck into the news at this point.
How were the coffees that I sent you this afternoon?
And I'll take that silence as you didn't have a coffee because I wasn't able to send you
because apparently, little known to me, Apple Pay Cash, not worldwide as I thought it was.
Yeah, I think we were bragging last episode how great Apple Pay is and how, you know,
we're so far ahead of the curve in Australia with our Apple Pay adoption, but they haven't graced
us with Apple Pay Cash in terms of being able to send and receive money between individuals. We
Just don't have that facility. It was the first time I've ever seen it sort of come up in my
my
My messages somebody trying to give me money. I was like, wow, this is exciting
Get the little black logo the Apple logo. It looked very fancy. It's cool
I clicked it and just nothing happened. You were lucky to receive it
Yeah, I sent it to both you and Martin's just it just said he he won't accept this
And then Andrews went through and it just perpetually says pending now
Which I'm wondering what that's gonna do on my side because now no it just has this this
Constant flashing thing that says pending but no way to do anything with it. So I'm assuming at some point it'll just
Give up. I don't know. I guess we'll find out or when you guys finally get Apple pay cash
You will have money on day one that pending just represents some poor soul and Cupertino calculating the exchange rate
Exactly. Yes. Yeah. There's probably some horrible bug now in the system where they're like this one transaction is just never gonna die
Yeah, one day our continent will be lucky enough to have real imaginary cash, whatever that is. I
Hope so. I hope we do get it one day
I hope we do because it it's it sure works
Well better than anything else because I tried other stuff too. Like so PayPal is I mean, it's awful
overall, but just trying to do the actual transaction through PayPal, you know, you
finally get through all the menus and the, the, the, the grossness of the UI.
And then I couldn't believe the number of fees that they tried to put, like,
let's say I was going to send $5.
There was like a dollar 20 for this, two 60 for that.
And then the exchange and all that.
And by the time I was trying to send $5, it was like $15.
Like what? No, I just wanted to give someone $5.
Like it's crazy.
And then on the iMessage side, I just typed five send and it was done.
Like it was so easy.
You know, the worst thing about it, too, is I really could have done
with a coffee today.
It was super generous of you because I needed one.
Yes, and much appreciated, Jason, even though I made one myself this afternoon.
I mean, look, the morning I had my coffee down the road
at a cafe called the White Rabbit where the purveyor is also called Martin.
You can imagine what that's like when the universe sort of folds on itself,
worlds collide, so maybe one day I can go there and buy my coffee off the other Martin with your money.
And I'll tell him where it came from and he'll be amazed.
So clearly in the last Apple event they didn't announce Apple Pay Cash for Australia,
So we know that now, but they did announce other stuff and I'm wanting to know, did either
of you buy anything or everything and why or why not?
I spent money.
I bought two things.
I bought, one of them new, one of them was, one of them was newly announced.
So I bought a new Apple Watch.
I bought the series six aluminum, not aluminum, but aluminum.
I thought we might get to that.
I bought that in the blue, um, 44.
Um, millimeter.
That's how they measure it, isn't it?
44 millimeters.
It's a big one.
Yeah.
It's like, it's like the one area where we actually use the same
measurements and it makes sense.
Yeah.
That's what just threw me there for a moment.
It's like, how many is that?
How many inches is that?
55 inch TVs and 44 millimeter watches, makes sense.
Yep, exactly.
So yeah, I bought that and I got it with the standard sport band.
Which is a new style sport band to me because this is going to be replacing my Series 1
Apple Watch.
Wow.
So I'm pretty excited because I think it'll be a massive upgrade.
That's going to be huge.
Everything's different.
Screen is different.
Always on.
Much bigger if I fall over somebody will know about it potentially. Yeah, I can I can swim with it now
It's actually gonna be a massive massive upgrade for me. So I'm pretty excited about it haptic crown. That's a big one for me
I love the haptic crown old ones feel broken. I hadn't even thought about that
See, look at this. This is this is gonna be amazing for me. It's like a whole new product for you
It's like not even really an Apple watch. It's like a Apple watch
Gen - yeah, and so I'm really excited because most people tend to upgrade, you know
No, I consider myself an Apple fanboy
But I'm I'm also a cautious spending Apple fanboy and I like to fully depreciate my assets
So I feel like rather than being a person who upgrades every year
I'm sort of I try and spread it out a little bit more and I really wanted to upgrade last year
And I thought no I could just get an I reckon I can just get one more year out of this thing
How was the series one holding up was it still working pretty well, or were you kind of already up against the wall with it?
I have to say apart from a few random days where the battery would die at 11 a.m.
Most days it still does really well. I I will still get to the end of the day and have a quarter of battery left
It's super slow though
I never you the only sort of features I can use on the old one
Workouts when I do a bit of gym work not enough gym work, but a bit
and
like play controls for podcasting, you know, just and
Literally just play/pause. I will sometimes use Siri to set a motion to set that to set a
Timer or something like that, but essentially that's it
And notifications, that's still pretty good though for a series one. I mean, that's that's a print in least in technology
It's pretty old. Yeah. Yeah, so it's I think it's done. Well, I'm really it's been a good product for me
but I'm really looking forward to getting a new one and just being able to um
See what all this what all the new stuff that's not that new is like
Is there a particular feature that was mentioned or something about the look or the design of the product that convinced you in the end?
Okay. Yes. This is the one that I want now. I'm gonna buy it. I was pretty ready going in to be honest
I think whatever they had released I would have bought
I
I don't like the the oxygen blood oxygen reading thing doesn't really didn't move the needle for me
Don't see that. I don't really think I need that
I'm more interested in the things that they that came out in the series 5 which will be the the always-on display and that
And the yeah the extra the altimeter is nice, but we live in a flat low-lying area
So I'm probably never going to use that
Now it's really just
Just the time just the combination of things
I'm really looking forward to the this the waterproofing which has been around forever except for me
Being able to swim in a thing will be really good, especially as I've last year
I started taking up sort of a bit of lap swimming
So it'd be nice to be able to track myself doing a bit of that
Well, I don't know if you're gonna be the sort of person who wears their watch in the shower because I wear my watch
Into the shower every single time and there's always that fun moment at the end when you turn off the water lock and you hear
That buzzing as the speaker injects the water. Have you two seen slow-mo videos of that happening and what's going on? It's awesome
I love it. Yeah, it's crazy. Yes. So you're gonna have to have a go.
Yeah, I'm looking forward to all those little features. I've got to make sure...
Do you have to turn that thing on, don't you? You have to tell it you're getting in the water,
right? Yeah, but that's only... Like if you're swimming, for example, or you're in the shower
and you don't want random input on the screen, because the water would sort of do a chaotic
simulation of your finger just stabbing at the screen. And one time I remember when I got the
series three, that's because I went from I think zero to three to four, so I'm on four now, but
when I had the three and I had the cellular and the waterproof capability, I was in the shower
and I accidentally called Natasha and she was on the phone and she said, "What are you doing?" I'm
like, "Oh, I had no idea that I called you." So you can have a random phone call or send messages
from the shower if you're not careful. So it's just about stopping that stabbing of the screen.
I have to admit I do live dangerously with the Series 1 sometimes.
Like tonight actually I took it in the shower with me.
Yeah you're fine.
You're honestly fine.
I had the Series 0 and I took that thing in the ocean and it was fine.
I don't think you can go down very far but it's fine.
And now with the 5 and the 6, you could do anything with these.
So that was my main purchase and then I also thought well I'm in for a penny in for a pound.
So you got a new iPad Air?
No, no, that's an area of conflict for me.
That's a whole other discussion.
But no, I bought a new set of AirPods Pro to replace, replacing my first generation
AirPods that only last for about half an hour.
Another big upgrade.
You're going to love that.
Yeah, so really looking forward to that surround sound capability that they've integrated.
Have you tried it, Martin?
I look, I mean, I could be completely crazy, but I tried it on a couple of movies that
I had purchased through the TV app, you know, iTunes or Apple TV or whatever we're supposed
to call it now.
And from what I could tell, it simulated that idea that the audio was coming from the phone.
It sounded boosted and a little bit bizarre, but it did make it seem much richer.
You haven't tried it yourself?
I have not.
No, I don't know if I have anything that it will, because it's only really with like content
that you get from iTunes or does it simulate with everything? I'm not really sure. I haven't
looked into it extensively, but it seems pretty awesome.
Yeah, yeah, I was impressed. I stuck on a couple of sci-fi things, you know, things
with soundtracks or effects that would have a whooshing past you or something. So it's
not exactly like being in a cinema or a home theater setup, but it does. I can only explain
it as a kind of TV or movie or an oriented semi surround sound take on what someone like Marco
Arment would do with voice boost for podcasting. It just gives it a lift and makes it seem like
it's coming from a certain direction. That's super cool. I like that. Yeah, I don't want to
oversell it, but give it a go. I have tried the auto switching and that actually works
amazingly well. Now, the thing that we've kind of always thought that they were supposed to do,
It's actually working now where you have your, you know, if you have your phone and
your iPad sitting there and you're listening to something on your phone and
then you go over to your iPad instead of having to pull down the control center
and then switch manually, it seems to just wherever I want to be listening.
It it's almost like it knows it and just is there.
Couldn't explain how it works, but it's sure seems to be working really well.
Haven't tried it with the computer yet.
So I'm a little weary of that because that's always hit or miss.
It seems like, but in terms of just iOS devices being connected, like if I'm listening to a
podcast on my iPhone and I look at the iPad, it still has the little microphone icon up in the
corner, but it's not actively sending me anything from there. So I don't know. And I'm sure this is
gonna be one of those things where it works great for me and works for no one else, but
currently it's been awesome. It's funny how that was an assumed feature. It was kind of like
I messages in sync or through the cloud. And then they said, yeah, we're bringing this and everyone
I went, "Oh, I thought that was the idea using the internet."
So yeah, we'll have to see how it goes for others.
- Yeah, I thought the audio thing,
I kind of just thought we already had it
and this was just as good as it was gonna be.
'Cause it works pretty good
when you try to switch back and forth.
Sometimes it's really fast when you say,
switch to my phone or switch to my iPad.
Sometimes it's like, just takes forever.
So I thought we already had it,
but it was just not that great.
Turns out we didn't,
and now it actually works really awesome.
- I'm looking forward to that feature.
That'd be cool. And to answer your question Jason, I did not buy anything from this and I went in 100% expecting to do so.
I have a Series 4 watch and I was thinking yeah I could do with another Apple Watch but as I was watching it I thought this looks really cool.
I love the red, I love the blue, the finishes, the bands, the blood oxygen thing.
Yeah it's not 100% what I would think to use but it's a nice feature.
thought you know what let's be sensible someone like Andrew has made a series one last all this
time and got great value out of it I should be a little bit more responsible and step back and I
think in our discord chat I also mentioned the fact that I'm quite attached to the idea of a
moving second hand so the fact that the always on display I don't think allows a moving second
hand even though it's brighter that is 100% not really anything wrong with the product but
something in my head that I would feel weird not seeing instantly. Yeah no it still still does not
not do that.
It's in the always on thing.
Uh, okay.
So, and I know Andrew, you just got to watch, I'm not trying to bum you out on
this, but for me, the only thing that I don't like about it is the weird
animation that it does.
And now that I'm saying this, I hope I don't ruin it for you, but it does this
like little, when it's in always on mode, it's almost like it shrinks the UI or
something.
And then when you wake it or when it goes back to like active, it kind of grows a
little, I don't know, it's got an animation thing and I don't really
fully understand why, but I kind of wish it didn't do that.
And I think the new one, cause the new one's brighter, right?
So maybe it doesn't do that now.
Cause the current five that I have, it actually does dim, but it sounds
like maybe it's not going to do that now.
So I don't know about the six, but in terms of the second hand thing, it doesn't
do that, but I could see that being a really cool thing to be able to just
see it constantly spinning around.
It would make it feel very much more, I guess,
like organic, almost like a mechanical watch or something.
- From what I could see in review videos,
I think the animation you're talking about
has been lessened because there were some demonstrations
that I saw where the watch was not in its active mode,
it was dormant, and it looked really quite bright.
So I reckon it's gonna be a really cool experience
for you, Andrew.
This is how tempted I was.
But it did sort of come to life a bit more.
For me, I mean, I agree with you,
The spinning second hand does lead it to feeling more organic, but really it's, I mean, I suppose
it's not really that important to my mind.
For some reason, I do spend a lot of time waiting for a minute to tick over.
I don't know what's wrong with my life, but I'm like, wow.
And then, you know, whether it's a meeting starting for work or, uh, you know, meeting
up with a friend or a relative or something, I, maybe it's just a bit of OCD, but it's
like, Ooh, on that.
I just like that.
Not a problem with the products just with me.
Don't worry.
It's not just you.
I do the same thing.
- When you were a little kid,
did you used to stay up till like too late at night
to watch your alarm,
bedside alarm clock flick over to midnight?
You know, watch it go from 1159 to 12,
the little red numbers changing.
- Yeah, and trying to time it with my mind
to see if I got it correct, absolutely.
(laughing)
Well, not so much clocks,
but the big thing that my dad would always do in the car
when we were driving for family trips
was he would note where the odometer was
he would say right we've got this long till we get home kids where do you think the odometer is going
to be or where do you think the clock's going to be and we'd have to guess the distance all the time
and it was like this family game i suppose that was our weirdo take on iSpy but looking at one
point of the car as a parent i can appreciate that okay so no no ipads all around i was kind
of surprised i i honestly thought one of you was going to pull the trigger on an ipad air since
it's basically an iPad Pro but much cheaper.
Yeah, I need some counseling here on this one.
I have an iPad Pro...
Is it the first?
I lose track of this.
There's so many these days.
You have the 10.5, right?
You guys both have the 10.5?
It's the 10.5, the 2017 model.
I think it was the first of the 10.5s.
The non-square edge one, right?
Yes, that's right.
And it's still fine.
It does everything I need.
I never feel like it's too slow or anything like that.
The only thing that I'm noticing all of a sudden is drastically reduced battery life.
Like it just drains.
You will sit there doing nothing and battery just drains down and I've tried all the voodoo.
I've tried deleting apps that I thought may be doing it.
I've looked at the battery management and trying to see what's sucking the juice.
It seems like it is just, whatever's going on in the background services, I can only
presume, is just causing the battery to drain really quickly.
To the point where I'm thinking, I need a new iPad just because I need a better battery.
But, and you've got this iPad Air now, which looks amazing, and better than my iPad Pro
in all ways except probably one, which would be the ProMotion display.
That's the one.
So I've got the, I've got the, it's an old iPad series one pencil, but does have the
120 Hertz.
And now I'm confused is a series two pencil at 60 Hertz a better deal?
Or do I just suck it up and wait and see what the iPad pro a 14 version will deliver?
Because there's got to be one.
There has to be.
I think that it's really, I feel like it's mostly a price thing at this point,
because I think the promotion is great, but I have to imagine for the stuff, at
least for me, you know, I'm not in procreate for six hours a day drawing.
Things or anything.
I'm mostly kind of poking at the screen with the pencil and doing some handwriting.
So I can't imagine.
I don't know.
I would actually like to try it for myself and see if I can even tell a
difference, but if other than the promotion storage size, and I feel
like there was one other thing, but it's so close that the next pro just has to
be, it's gotta have something crazy because if it's just kind of the same as
now, then I'm just confused as to like, is promotion really a quote pro feature?
I guess so.
There has to be some, like you say, there has to be something amazingly
new coming with the next one.
Yeah, something to justify that, like, cause it's like full,
it's 599 and it jumps up to 799 or 899 or something.
It's several hundred dollars more, which I think for most people,
you're not going to notice a difference.
You're just going to save 300 bucks and have a really sweet iPad that actually
comes in a cool color instead of boring gray.
So for each of you, what, what does, I mean,
other than the fact that pro generally means nice,
what is the iPad for each of you
and what convinces you to get a new one?
- For me, the iPad is essentially now my laptop.
I converted to an iMac just before COVID-19,
which seems like a stroke of genius
because I've been able to base myself at home
and have a really comfortable computer to work at.
I like working in this at-home environment,
but if I was having to do it like with a laptop,
oh man, I'd be totally over it.
So yeah, having this iMac has been great,
but my ancient MacBook Pro became a Roblox machine
from my kid.
And so I don't have a laptop at the moment.
And I thought, well, do I need one?
And I look at the Apple Silicon ones coming up
and think, oh, I'd like one of those.
But for the moment, the iPad has basically been my laptop
as well as my around the house,
do everything, read, consume kind of machine.
And it's done really well.
I have the cellular, um, iPad as well.
So, and I think that's almost a non-negotiable for me, um, is having that.
Um, but yeah, it's, it's really is, it's probably my most used
device for non-work activity.
Yeah, it's the same for me.
It's, it's the, it's my do everything device.
Um, it's mostly, I think screen size is what makes it kind of pro, I guess, in my
mind, uh, because you can, you know, connect it to the keyboard folio thing.
And then it's kind of more like a laptop or just rip it off of that.
And then it's actually a tablet.
Uh, you know, I think a lot of stuff I'll sit down at my, at a Mac book and do
whatever, but I can't rip the screen off of a Mac book and, and just kind of, you
know, turn it 90 degrees and then read a long article on it.
It's just, it's, it's to do, it's the do everything device for me, where if I had
to just have one device, it'd be really hard to give up a Mac.
I don't think I'll ever give up a Mac fully.
I don't, I really subscribed to the, like, you have to use iOS.
You have to use Mac iOS.
It's like, just use whatever makes sense at the time.
Um, but if I had to just do one thing, it would probably be the iPad pro.
And just cause I think it can do many of the same things plus a lot more.
And I don't think adding like a touchscreen to a Mac is going to fix that either.
I don't even think that's a good idea personally, but yeah, I think the pro
aspect of it for me is kind of taking it from that tablet experience, kind of one
step further where now I have USB-C and I can plug in a thing if I need to.
Not everything really plugs into it at this point someday, maybe, but those are
the kinds of things I think that make it pro, uh, for me and I know the whole
pro moniker, I know it's never going to go away.
It's been there forever, but it's just kind of a misnomer at this point where
it's like, what does that even mean to anyone?
No one cares about the word pro.
It doesn't distinguish that, you know, you make movies, you buy the pro and I
don't make movies, so I buy the regular pro does just mean more expensive, nicer,
more features, more stuff attached to it.
So I think that's just my thing is that I go pro
because it can do more generally.
- It is kind of nonsensical because professional,
I mean, it's not really professional, anyone can do it.
And if it means prosumer, like prosumer,
everyone is technically a prosumer these days.
If you upload anything to the web
or anything on a social network,
whether it's a TikTok video or some sort of professional
in inverted commas project that you've done
on your iPad Pro or your Mac, everyone's producing.
So I agree, it's, it's a bit of a nonsensical name.
It's kind of annoying too, for, for, you know, just cause a lot of it is tied
to price that, you know, if you got a, an iPad air or an iPad pro it's, you know,
if, if, if an iPad air is, is your max budget and that's what you can get into.
You can do everything that anyone else could do with a pro, but it's kind of
like this, like, well, you know, you do things, but you're not like a pro at it.
It's like, what does that even mean at this point?
But I don't know.
I think it's annoying tying price to the status of the, of your work, I guess, is
what it sounds like, where you're saying, you know, you can only be a pro if you
can spend $900, but you can't be a pro if you can only spend $700.
I think if I'm being totally honest with myself, I am, it is an ego driven thing
for me.
I don't, I want to think of myself as needing the pro the best.
If you actually looked at what I did with an iPad, I'm certain an iPad Air would
be just fine. But there's something about it where this is my passion, this is my hobby,
I kind of just want the best. But I think if you benchmarked me using an Air versus
a Pro, there'd be zero difference in reality. Oh, for sure. I think that'd be for most of
us. That's the same across... I feel like it's the same issue with why I have, you know,
6,000 apps on my phone. It's like, it's a just in case kind of scenario. I feel like
the same with things like the iPad Pro where it's like ProMotion. Well what if I don't have it?
What if there's that time where I need it? And it's like, okay, we use it to justify the purchase,
but a lot of times I think you're totally right. If I had a green iPad Air, I'd be thrilled.
But look, given what you said, Andrew, about the way that you've waited to upgrade your watch
and also seemingly the way you're going to wait to update your iPad, I think it's perfectly fine
to splurge on such a thing if you're going to get that pride or sense of passion out of using it
and you're going to enjoy using the product because and this sort of comes to the point
that I thought was most impressive or that I enjoyed the most about the presentation. It might
sound a bit weird but I was really happy to see a segment that was devoted to talking about the
environment with Lisa Jackson. Do you both remember that bit? Yes absolutely and it really,
it's really, keep talking about it but it really struck home for me and it reminds me of something
I'll tell you after. Yeah, yeah, I mean it what I think is really important is you know we want to
upgrade these devices, we want to move to the latest and greatest thing, but it is Apple's
responsibility to actually discuss these things where their resources are coming from, how they're
using their energy, and she did make the point, that's Lisa Jackson, that I think she said that
Apple's corporate headquarters and retail stores already run on 100% renewable energy but they're
shifting to carbon neutrality by 2030 throughout the supply chain and that's really interesting
to me because yes Apple pushes all of this stuff like recycling programs and trade-ins but then
what's the energy consumption in recycling that? Yes you're giving over a device but
what you know how intensive is the energy consumption and actually transforming this
old product into a new one or a new material? So I'm not saying that Apple's perfect and they
like a lot of companies have a long way to go, but I felt better watching this presentation going
yep this is really the only company of this size with this technological focus that's
talking about this in the middle of a massive product showcase. So I was quite happy with that.
Uh yeah same here. I actually really was happy to see the charger go away. I think you know there's
people are going to be how they are about things like that. I uh my personal anecdote about it
it though. Um, so we, every time we buy anything, we save the box that it came
in, whether we need it or not.
We just kind of have like a box of boxes, you know, in the basement of, and
generally because we, we hand stuff down to other people or we sell them or
whatever.
And when I give something to somebody, I just, I think it's a nice touch to just
say like, you know, yeah, you're getting my old phone, but like it comes in, in
the original box with the original stuff, just kind of a nicer experience for
whoever's getting it.
And so when we moved, I was going through this kind of box of boxes just to see,
like, do we even have some of this stuff still?
Do we need it?
And of course there was a bunch of different Apple boxes.
Uh, in there.
So I started going through them cause I was going to get rid of a bunch of them.
And I just want to make sure nothing was left in there.
Lo and behold, many of these boxes had not only all the original paperwork stuff,
but a lot of the chargers and cables, because, you know, as you upgrade,
you don't need a new cable every time.
Some people seem to thrash their cables,
not sure how that happens, but for me,
I was going through, I took note of this.
So in there were four Apple Watch chargers,
the little puck things, five of the five watt chargers,
which is the one they just said
they're not gonna put out anymore,
so that seems to make sense,
and two of the 18 watt chargers.
So in boxes, in a box, I realize this is not the norm,
but I had a ton of chargers that I just don't need,
And if, if I don't need them, you know, they're just going to sit in a box
somewhere.
So I, I have to think that this is not as bad as a lot of people are making it out
to be.
I think less chargers out there, the better.
And honestly, the five watt chargers, I mean, they kind of suck anyway.
They're just, they're slow.
So everybody has bought a charger off of, you know, XYZ store, or they have one in
their car already, or they have one in the house.
So getting rid of the charger, I think it's a really great thing.
You know, and I think it's under this, this idea of, of lessening stuff in the
environment, because you have to think the number of phones and watches that go
out the door every day with a charger.
That's a hell of a lot of chargers that are just not getting used.
And they're being created.
So all the materials in those chargers are now not available for
other devices that could be used.
So I think that's the other half of it is that there's a lot of stuff in those
chargers that is not getting, you know, removed from the pipeline to be used for
other products that people will actually use.
That that's a really good, that's a really good point.
That that's the classic opportunity cost argument there.
Um, and I think, uh, and I think the other thing is that all these devices now are
really smart about managing power inputs.
So it doesn't really matter if you use a big boy charger on something that, you
It wasn't the device wasn't necessarily designed for that. I think they can all manage you know the so it doesn't yeah
Oh, yeah, I use the 90 watt charger for everything. Yeah, so it's not like you need to have one of everything or you know
Match match the charge voltage with the um or the wattage with the the device
So yeah, it's just whichever one you happen to find and have lying around use that so do away the dinky ones. It's fine
Yeah, I I keep a 90 watt MacBook Pro charger at my desk to plug in
Everything from my phone all the way up to a MacBook Pro just one charger, which is great
The one thing I think would have been nice for Apple to do and this is purely just a goodwill
Measure would be of to just reduce the price just a little bit to offset to to
Logically offset the cost of or the price of not getting something
Because yeah sure for them. It's probably ten cent
Include, you know in terms of the cost of production and all that
But I think for a customer if you just knock a few bucks off the price and you can point to that and say that's
The cost that you're now not paying. I think that would make
People who don't care about the environmental stuff sort of say, oh at least I'm saving a few bucks
Yeah, well talking about the costs there
This is where I'm really interested to see what the company does when it comes to eventual announcements of Apple silicon Macs
are we going to see a
Kind of price reduction giving that given that they won't be
Giving that money to Intel for chips or are they just going to keep those margins up?
So I think we're in quite a period of transition at the moment with all of these things
Yeah, I mean, unfortunately
The way of the world is Wall Street. So I think we know where that's gonna land
Wall Street doesn't care about the environment Wall Street doesn't care about customers Wall Street cares about Wall Street
Yeah that quarterly earnings call you got to be showing you you got you got your margins covered
So if anyone needs an Apple charger, just let me know
I'm actually short a lightning cable or two if you could fire a couple of those over. That'd be good. Sure. No problem
So next up on the list, I'm curious to know because I can see both of your faces against it in our nodes default mail clients
What's the deal here? Yeah, that is confusing to me a little bit. I you know, we got that in iOS 14 is
We have the ability to now have a default mail client that is not Apple Mail and a default browser, which is not Safari
That's fine. I think that's great choices is good
Um, on the Safari side, I use Safari anyway, so it doesn't really bother me
there, but I see that being valuable.
The mail side is the one that I am curious what you guys feel about this.
You know, I, I, it was a new feature.
I was like, Oh, cool.
I'm going to set a default mail client.
And as I started thinking about it, I kind of came to the conclusion that I don't
care with a mail client because I don't understand, like with a browser, people
are, I messaging you links, you're on the web, you're getting links all over the
place and when you click a link expecting it to open in Firefox, but it opens in
Safari, I, yeah, that's, I could see that being annoying, but for mail, if I'm
going to write an email, I'm already in the mail client.
So that's covered.
If I'm going to reply to an email again, already in the mail
client, don't need to do that.
The only scenario that I'm coming up with, and maybe I'm just really
glaringly missing something here is if there's a mail to link somewhere.
And I just, when was the last time you ever clicked a mail to link anywhere?
And nowadays everything's a form on a webpage.
So that's pretty much taken care of.
No one really has, you know, send me an email mail link.
I guess we do on our website.
So that's one place that's not about thinking of, but other than that, does
the default mail client really matter?
It seems like the browser was the big win for everyone.
And they just kind of threw mail in because it was like, yeah, here's another
and to make it seem like there's choice.
- It almost placates the nerds, I think.
It's a little olive branch, a gesture,
because like note-taking apps,
various different things that we want to try,
email tends to be the thing
that tech enthusiasts are still talking about.
Hence, we're talking about it right now.
So personally, I'm happy with the default mail app.
I don't think it's horrible.
Yes, there are things that could be improved.
The big thing that I turn off is that conversation with you.
I actually can't understand it.
maybe I'm stupid, but the way that it groups things together,
that would be, if I couldn't change that,
that might be the thing to make me try something else.
But the fact that I can turn it off
and have things work in a way that fits my brain logically,
I stay with it.
I don't know, what about you, Andrew?
- That is such a good tip,
because I too feel a bit old with that conversation for you.
I think I've got to do that.
Something changed in email a few years ago,
where suddenly you got your sent messages threaded in
with the ones being sent, you know, the inbox sort of threaded in with the sent mailbox.
And I live in this slightly permanent state of stress these days whenever I delete something
and I have no idea if I'm deleting the entire thread or an individual mail.
And I honestly don't quite understand what I, how to manage email anymore in that regard.
It sounds pathetic, but I don't know how.
No, no, no, I agree with you because you've tapped on a thing called inbox and you expect to see the messages that came in
But if you're seeing messages that went out, it's trying to simulate a chat, but it's not a chat
It's two separate folders mishmash together and I can't negotiate that. Yeah
Yeah, I don't like it either and and especially when everybody replies and the thread always gets like, you know
Quoted back at you in in its entirety each time
So you you can kind of one minute one the latest email in the thread basically contains everything anyway
And at least then it's one distinct entity that you can delete move whatever. I never know what I'm doing
Am I moving a thread or removing a mail message? I don't know so that's my old man whinge of the day
Default mail clients well yeah, I thought it would be something I'd get into as well
But because I don't like I don't like mail on iOS from version 13 onwards
IOS 13 before that it was fine. They did all those changes in 13 and they said he you know
They hid all the buttons behind that
reply
The magical reply. Yep
Slash, you know forward arrow or whatever it was. You don't click reply to print. That's seems pretty normal
It could have even just been one of those little share sheet arrows, but it wasn't.
Anyway, so that put me right off mail.
I generally bounce between either just the, on iOS I have tended towards using just the
Fast Mail app for my purposes.
I use the Outlook mail for work because I have to.
Um, and it's, it's actually better.
So, but again, I'm split personality.
So a default email client, I don't want it to be either of those one things.
Cause I've got sort of two lives living in it.
So I don't think it's actually going, I don't think I'm ever going to play with that one.
If you, if you could, if either of you could pick a category that you would want the most,
I don't even think, I mean, for me, browser is Safari, so that doesn't really matter.
But if you could pick a different category, music or to-do lists or whatever, what would
be one that would actually be useful to you day to day?
Or would none of them, because again, with the multiple personalities on a device, it
doesn't really make sense to have a default anything.
I would say, I don't even know if it's relevant.
The only thing I can think of is default notes app.
But I don't think there's such a thing anyway.
The way it ties into iCloud at least maybe avoids the need for that.
I see what you mean though.
If you couldn't tie in something like IA Writer to iCloud that would make it painful.
At least for me.
I would like the pencil feature like where you tap the iPad when the screen is off with
the pencil and it immediately opens a new note.
I would like that to be able to be changed.
I think that's the one thing.
Because I'm not currently using Apple Notes for my actual notes.
So every once in a while I'll tap the screen and that'll come up and I will remember what
an amazing feature that is that I can't really make use of.
That's a good one.
What about default calendar apps?
Have they changed that?
No, it's still just the two.
I think I click calendar links probably more than I do, absolutely more than I do email
links though for sure.
So that would actually be a nice one.
But I guess that one, that one's kind of weird though,
because most calendar apps kind of just piggyback
off of regular calendar anyway.
So they're kind of just giving you like a viewport into that.
I think Fantastical now,
because you can actually put your accounts in there,
it's a little different, but for the most part,
I think they all just kind of add a layer
on top of regular calendar.
So even that one wouldn't matter entirely.
- How many people do you reckon are out there
who would love to set Google Maps as their default?
Oh, probably most people.
I think most people still use Google maps from what I can tell.
Anyway, it seems like much of the internet is still doing
Google maps over Apple maps.
Um, I don't know.
How is it for you?
I think it's very location dependent too, though.
It seems like, of course, when I was in, you know, living down the
street from the donut, you know, it works great there.
Um, and I've, it works great here too, for me anyway, but I don't
know about other countries.
I'm sure Apple maps is, is maybe doesn't have as many features as
Google Maps? It doesn't. I actually use Apple Maps probably more often than
Google these days but I'm doing it knowing it's not as good. It doesn't
have, certainly doesn't have the density of business location information. Probably
the one thing that I like Apple Maps for is that Google Maps has actually become
bloated. It's starting to get too confusing because it's not really
just a mapping app anymore. It's a rate and review the place you just went to
And tell us if the doughnuts really good you know it's tracking your moves as you as you go around you know
Did you take photos that they're at the burger joint put them on?
on the on the Google site and leave a review and
It just I don't like that
So are you trying to tell me that you feel like Google is creepy. It's just a little
Yeah
So I just feel I just feel that Apple. Yeah, it's it's it's route. It's routing routing is
Good enough gets me where I need to be
Doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but if I am going somewhere slightly out of the ordinary
I will do a double check on Google because it does know its directions better
Yeah, I'm a real Apple Maps fan. I accept the Google Maps is
Better generally in terms of how much data it has because like you said Jason the creep factor is there
But I remember the first time that I ever started using Apple Maps for Sat Nav and then
I compared it to Google.
I mean UIs change, things get improved, but I found that Apple Maps had a much nicer turn
by turn navigation experience.
I felt like you had a better sense of warning about when to turn and it seemed to line up
better with when you were actually supposed to go in a different direction.
Google was a bit, the timing was off, so as far as I was concerned with Apple's at least
first out of the gate vector mapping and the general niceness of the whole thing.
I've used Apple since. That's just been my thing.
It kind of leads into another topic of the ecosystems that you had brought up
Martin about things that are tempting from,
or I guess products or services that are tempting from other ecosystems that
we're not maybe fully in or not in at all.
Yeah, I'm glad you segued to that. And look, I mean,
I'd be happy to kick it off, but given that we've been talking about Google,
I think Andrew had something noted down about Android.
Is that right?
Did you want to kick us off?
- Well, yeah.
I've never owned an Android device
and I have friends who have them
and they will use them and I look at them and think,
I have no idea what you're doing there.
And there's things about the Android I don't like,
like the scrolling always puts me off.
It just seems to be janky.
But at the same time, I look at it and go,
that looks intriguing.
just be and I'm curious to know how it works in detail and it's just the nerd in me wants
to know like how these things actually hang together and I've never really bothered to
buy one because why would I?
Yeah, happy with iPhones.
So that's one area and then the other area of sort of going on still sort of I guess
somewhat Android related is I'm slightly interested in a Chromebook. After just
saying how creepy Google is, I'm just curious to know what life is like having
a laptop that is purely a web browser. You know, I just wonder how useful is
such a thing and are they, could I find a particular purpose for that? So that's
probably the thing, the two things that I find somewhat tempting, but obviously not
tempting enough for me to throw my money at them. I don't mean to be a smartass with the
Chromebook but are you looking to be punished or how? Are they that bad really? I've done both.
I've used both. I think the Chromebook personally is a product searching for a problem or a solution
looking for a problem rather. It's a cheap computer and that is the number one reason that
that it's made, I think, uh, you know, I I'm sure people will, will say otherwise.
It's again, I think it's a, it's a tool where if you literally only need to look
at Gmail in the web and maybe do browsing and like Google docs, if you're a Google
person, it's great.
As soon as you want to do anything else, I just, I don't know.
And again, I just, I don't, I don't trust anything they do personally.
So I, I cannot put my whole life invested in them.
A lot of people do and that's, and that's okay.
As long as they understand that.
But I think the Chromebook, it's a, it's a cheap way to get a browser when, and I
think in some instances, that's a really good thing if, if that is your means to
get to the web, then that's your means to get to the web.
Well, I don't use Gmail.
I don't use Chrome.
Um, I'm using primarily Apple maps.
Um, I don't use Google calendar.
I don't think this thing's for me.
- You're just driven to flirt with the devil.
Is that right?
You just wanna see what it's like.
- Yeah, I think so.
It's like the grass is always greener, right?
Where it's kinda, what you have is,
you don't know how great the thing is you have
until you try to go look at something else.
And that's exactly what happened to me with Android.
It was a while ago now, but it was after the 3GS.
So a while ago, I switched to Android after the 3GS.
And then when the four came out, I went back to the iPhone and then it's, yeah,
it was iPhone up to three GS, then Android, then back to on the iPhone four.
And I just stayed on that train ever since, but I Android, it seems like it's,
it's fine.
Uh, I, it's really, it's the Google thing.
I don't want anything to do with Google.
It's the same thing.
You know, if it's like Oculus now where they're owned by Facebook.
Unfortunately, it's the best damn headset there is and I don't want to use it anymore
because it's 100% Facebook and I don't want anything to do with them.
And so I have to get rid of it.
I can't be hypocritical and say, "Oh, well, it's not really Facebook.
It's, it's, no, it's Facebook.
You know, it's, it's the same with everything else they own."
Well, it's Instagram.
It's not, no, it's Facebook.
So you either go all in on Facebook or you completely cut it off.
There's no in between.
They don't have an in-between, they don't look at it internally as a company and say,
"Oh, we can't put our horrible policy on that.
That's Oculus."
No, it's Facebook above all.
And the same goes for Google.
So I was gonna say, are you tempted by anything else?
Any other brands or types of product in general?
I don't think I'll actually ever buy it.
But the one thing that has come out recently that I really think is a really cool device
is the Microsoft Surface Duo, which I guess is a phone sort of?
It's like a wallet phone, isn't it?
It folds in half?
Yeah, it's like a phone tablet thingy.
It's a folding phone, I guess you can call it that.
Not in the, I guess, now traditional sense of like the Samsung, wow, help me out here,
Z-fold flip cube, whatever it's called, or the razor.
- Is that the one that broke before they even released it?
- Yeah, that was the first one.
And then they put out a re-released one.
And now I think there's a second one.
They're cranking them out left and right.
But that's the one where like the screen is like plastic
and actually folds in half, which I see no value in either.
But the Duo is, it's really just two separate screens.
So really on the surface, it doesn't really seem,
on the Surface doesn't really seem like that big of a deal, but it just,
it's an intriguing device.
They're very, it's a very thin device and I could see it being kind of useful.
And it's also weird because all the Microsoft phones are Android now.
So maybe Andrew, you could get a Surface Duo and that helps me out and you get to
use Android.
Well, I'm just looking, I'm just looking, I quickly Googled it.
And one of the first articles that came up, I didn't Google it.
Sorry.
I should say that.
I'm trying a new search browser, i.e. Ecosia.
- I don't even know what you're talking about.
- Wait, whoa, whoa, hold on.
You did what?
Is that legal?
Can you do that in Australia?
- Doesn't roll off the tongue.
But before I get sidetracked,
apparently the Microsoft Surface Duo
isn't coming to Australia yet.
- Oh no.
- So, link in the show notes.
Yeah, Ecosia, sorry, Ecosia?
It's a search browser that as you search,
Apparently they plant trees on your behalf.
- I have never heard of this.
- I have a feeling it might be a Bing driven.
- Oh yeah, Bing.
- Remember that thing?
Yeah, I've just tried, I've always,
I've sort of been a DuckDuckGo user for a long time,
but I saw this and I thought, I'll just give it a try.
- So how did they calculate that?
How many web pages equals a tree?
- Let me see, I've got 46 trees at the moment.
- That's a lot of search history.
Hang on. No, that's the number of searches.
So I've only been using it for a short time, 46 searches,
and I need 45 searches to plant a tree.
I just planted a tree, everybody.
- Wow, congratulations.
- Searching for the Microsoft Surface Duo
planted me a tree.
- Well done.
And did they specify the kind of tree that's being planted?
- No, palm oil or something.
- We'll send someone out to get a picture of your tree
at some point, and we'll put that in the notes as well.
I could just picture it now in my little tree out there. Suddenly, you know, it's just a little just one leaf
I can see it. I need a webcam on my tree. Well given that discussion about the environment good on you for actually doing something Andrew
It depends on the search results. It gives you if it starts going pear-shaped. Maybe it plants pear trees
What random thing are you buying Martin? That's not something you actually need. Well mine is sort of
Weird and boring, but they come down to the idea of I suppose
Focus in technology so something that I've never owned and has been around for years is it and it and is incredibly boring is just
The Kindle and I've always been fascinated because I have Apple books right on my iPad
And I have lots of printed books on my bookshelf, but I've never been part of that
Amazon ecosystem and like you Jason with the Google stuff
I've always thought I don't really want to go all in on Amazon because
Well, that just doesn't seem like my thing and I've already got all this other stuff
but whenever I see someone with a Kindle or a Kobo or whatever the other K products are and the fact that they just have
This one focus device with all of their books on it, which is away from notifications and glossy displays. I always think
Is it worth it? But I've never pulled the trigger. I don't know. What do you two think?
I have one sitting on the shelf that I haven't touched in a year. So yeah, that says it then
Yeah, it's it's a really they're really cool. I really like them. I just never
Remember that I have it or that it's a thing. Yeah
It's the e-ink the product itself is, you know, whatever. It's fine as Kindle as a product is okay
It's just the fact that it's the e-ink. That's that's the feature that matters on a Kindle and it's great
But you know, it's another thing you got to carry around
It's another thing you got to charge when you have something that already has a screen and you know
I don't I don't personally read for you know, four hours straight
So like I strain on a on a tablet is not really a big deal for me when I'm on a computer all day
Anyway, but it is it's a nice thing to have
I think if you were super into reading and just like that was what you did
I think it makes a lot of sense to get one. Yeah, I don't know. Do you have one Andrew?
I'm holding it in my hand as we speak. Are you a fan? I am this would be about my third Kindle. I think I have now
It's just the paper white, you know that was released last year or whatever
So I've been I remember by I bought
Wasn't the first one that had that giant
Keyboard and it was kind of looked like a Soviet era
Contraption with the angles. What was that called Kindle Vostok or something or Kindle Sputnik? Yeah. Yeah, it totally did
Yeah, it had like the big
Slider thing or something down one side. Mm-hmm. It sort of looked like a Fisher price kind of toy
I thought that looked amazing
I wanted it so badly, but I think the price and availability in Australia ruled that out
I bought the second one though that came out and then and I've I
Use it quite often and I think for reading fiction. That's where it really is perfect
If you just want to get a book be on a holiday or be you know sitting around in bed or whatever just reading a book
for
recreation
Highly recommend it the price is obviously pretty cheap to buy books. So that's good
The hardest thing is like getting getting beyond the truck and trying to find you know
what is a good book and that's where publishers and
you know bookstores and all that still have their place because you don't have the
Extended long tail of the Amazon self-publishing world
So I still you know try and get a list books if you want to call on that
But I enjoy reading from it. Oh if you're reading it for research purposes though Martin, I wouldn't wouldn't recommend it
Just too too clunky. Yeah, I tried to use it for school books in the past and it's too slow
to like if you need to go from page four back to the index back to
You know the some glossary in the back of the book. It's just not feasible
I think like you said Andrew, it's really like if you're gonna read a fiction book just back or front to back
That's the best place for this
Yeah, and and I like reading it on I don't like reading
Extended time on the iPad. I just find it
It's it wears my eyes out too much, but a Kindle now you can go for ages and the paper
Why this isn't my actually my first paper white one?
I had the the older one before this that didn't have that and it's excellent the backlighting is not brilliant
You know, you can sort of see where the lights are a little bit, but it's fine
So, yeah, I'm
Pro Kindle. Okay, that's a good summary. I feel that's pretty balanced. I don't know if I'll get one
But yeah, it's always just set in the back of my mind whenever I say that looks light and that's easy to carry
But just to quickly mention the other thing that I had in my brain
I don't know if either of you are familiar with this product
I'm all in on Apple watch obviously
But this is a watch that I saw years ago prior to the Apple watch have either of you ever heard of the clock - I?
Don't think so. Don't think so. Yeah, it's spelt
It's the CLOCK2W and it's this German made watch which is simply a grid of letters and
it illuminates the time in words from those letters.
And you can choose the language.
Oh that's cool.
Yeah it's awesome and it's really expensive.
They have a big wall one.
Yes and they have one that looks like it's rusty and it's just really awesome design
but I've never been able to justify it for the price and the fact now that the Apple
watch exists you go, "Do I need this?" But I remember seeing it years ago and going,
"This is outside of my watch ecosystem and budget." It's pretty cool.
That looks incredible.
Oh, we need this. This looks good.
If you had an architecture studio or something and you just had that on the wall.
Yeah, huge talking point.
I can't find a price.
That looks fancy.
Oh, it's only $13,000.
Is that the wall one?
Oh, I might as well get two.
Yeah, I'm looking at the wall one because I don't need a watch, but the wall one is
pretty cool.
Yeah, well the watch you can even get in, I think you can get in English, German, French,
and now even Arabic.
So it's pretty fascinating.
Good find.
This would be such a cool piece to have.
Yeah, yeah.
So I bring that up with a sense of bittersweetness or melancholy.
Like maybe I won't get that.
Cool dimension.
Yeah, I don't know if I need it $8,000 worth but it sure does look cool
Well, if you could send Apple pay cash to someone in Europe to get it for you and wait for that little man to do
The euro conversion then maybe they can send it back to you. Ah, good point
That does remind me that it reminds me of something that I would love to have and they don't do you
Are you guys old enough to remember back in when air porch used to have those?
Ticker boards where the letters would flip over to ship. Oh, yeah, like it and like train stations, too
Yeah, and it would make that big clunking noise and there's that I remember reading an article about these things
There's a certain name that they have a camera off the top of my head
But yeah, I would I just love those things and the saddest thing about the digital era seeing them go away
And I'm sure there's probably a digital version out there that sort of flips over in the same way
If you could combine that with a watch
That'd be pretty cool.
Well my digital version was in the old Mac OS X dashboard widget section and I don't
know if either of you two were Lost fans like the TV show with the 108 minute ticker.
Oh yeah.
Yeah and every 108 minutes my computer would make a screeching sound and I had to put in
the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42.
That was the closest I got to having something like that at home.
Push the button brother!
Yeah that's Desmond isn't it?
Brilliant.
(laughs)
Love that show, except for the ending.
- Oh, really?
That's another podcast, I liked it.
But anyway, I suppose we should keep things moving.
Jason, did you wanna,
now what's all this with domain and file sharing?
- Oh, that was Andrew.
So I had shared something with you guys at some point,
or shared something, I don't remember.
I sent some link to someone.
Was it you, Andrew, that I sent?
I sent you like a file or something.
Yeah, you yeah, it was because I was I was really impressed because you sent me a link to a file and
The kind of thing that you would normally get from somebody that would be a dropbox download or something like that
and it was a
Linked from your website. So you had a I think it was get dot
Bert dot IO or something along those lines camera what the the prefix was? Yeah
But yeah, and I thought well, that's really cool. And I was just curious as to
How you were doing that? Are you was it? Are you literally just uploading it to a file storage?
you know to your web server space or and
How are you getting that to all hang together? And is it something that is you have systematized or is it kind of a
You know stuck together with chewing gum and it's a little bit stuck together, but it's pretty straightforward actually
Um, it is, yeah, it's get.burke.io.
And I just, I got tired of sending, um, well, I don't really use Dropbox anymore.
So that didn't, that wasn't an option.
Usually you would just throw something in there and send somebody a link, but
I didn't, it wasn't using Dropbox.
Um, iCloud sharing.
I don't think that was even a thing yet.
And then there's just so many different random websites where you can upload
stuff and send people links, but it was like, I don't, what am I,
where am I putting these files?
It seems kind of weird.
I'd rather just kind of know where I'm putting stuff
and control it myself.
So it's all really built on top of an app called Dropshare,
which is, it's just a, it's a Mac app.
It's an iOS app.
I really mainly use it on the Mac,
but you can use it on iOS as well.
And they have like cloud accounts now
where you can just share it directly using their stuff.
Oh, it's on Setapp also.
- It's on Setapp.
- So if you have Setapp, then you already have it,
which is great.
Setapp is really, I was really skeptical at first, not so much in the idea of it, but
I just didn't think it was really going to work.
But given the number of apps that keep showing up on there from pretty prominent developers
and a lot of indie developers too, I have to assume it's working to some degree for
them.
Otherwise they wouldn't be on there.
But anyway, Setapp, I feel like it's a really great service.
I hope it's not terrible for the people that are on it.
I haven't heard that it has been so ignorance is bliss, I guess.
But anyway yeah, Dropshare.
And then the nice thing about Dropshare is it allows you to use kind of any
backend that you want.
So you can use like Amazon S3, which again, I don't use cause it's Amazon.
Trying to get away from that a little bit, but I use something called Wasabi,
which is like an S3 compliant alternative.
Um, it's cheaper than.
Barebones use that for their you Jimbo sync a few years ago. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's fantastic. It's super fast
It's cheaper than s3 and it's not Amazon which if that's important is a good thing
But anyway, I just use that as a back end and then it makes it super simple
I drag a file up to my menu bar it
Uploads it to that
automatically copies a link to my clipboard and then I can send it and you can also create really cool like like I haven't
Done this yet, but you can make a custom landing page
So that thing that I sent you I can make it look like whatever I want and have you have the file kind of nicely
Presented so if you were using it for like a business type of situation, you can have a nice landing page
And then you can use custom domain. So I just set one up for get dot my domain
So now everything I send is get dot
Burke dot IO slash and then the file name
so it's it's just like it's a nice way to know where you're sharing things and
Just know that they're there and then also be able to just get rid of the file
Entirely if you need yeah
So it has an audit trial you can kind of see who's
Whose access to download the file that kind of thing? No. No, there's no like logging of you know
Andrew downloaded this file 14 times. It's nothing like that. If you needed something like that, you'd more want to go with
You know one of the many file services out there
This is really I think more for for a personal use type of thing or just like a small business, too
All right, but it's just it's nice to be able to send somebody a link. That's not you know
Oh now you need to go get an account because I sent you a you know
A Google Drive link and you don't have Google Drive or whatever. It's just it's very simple back to basics
Normal download off the internet. No, they don't need anything special. Mm-hmm. I was really impressed by it and
Maybe that's a sad reflection on me. I don't know
But I thought was cool. So I was just interested to know how you'd done that. So thank you
I think I have a blog post on it somewhere so I can link that too
That'll be good. And then I can then I'll have a project over the next week
Yeah, you can do that and YouTube DL and you'll be set
That's it's still on the list. What have you got for us next Martin?
You've been you've been sort of been a bit quiet over the last little while and you're I'm looking at the list here
Oh, well, I mean, I don't know if you want to because I know Jason had the thing about test flight
You had the screenshot here. So I have more to contribute. Don't worry. Well, look, I mean, I don't know
Did you want to say anything about those two things first because I was quite fascinated by the addition of the new segment
Oh the thing I found in my house
Yeah, yes, what did you find in your house? You've added something in the notes there
So one of the great joys of moving is you get to rediscover?
Everything that you own
For for better or worse and this is I think for better, but I'm finding a lot of old
Stuff, you know, it's making me realize that
I'm a collector. I like to collect things. I think a lot of us do
But I thought this one was particularly interesting. Maybe not super
Interesting to everybody that listens to the show but what something I found
in my house or in a box rather that I find to be pretty cool is a
Gameboy micro
Famicom 20th anniversary edition
That's a mouthful. What's all that about?
Probably nobody knows what that is
I think everybody can probably know what a Gameboy is that seems like a pretty easy one and I remember something about the super
Famicom or something like that that was kind of legendary or something was it? Yep. Yep
So like in Japan it was called that here it became the NES or the Nintendo Entertainment System
So this was a Game Boy Game Boy micro so small
Released in 2005 both in Australia and the US so you guys had it too
But it's just this tiny tiny Game Boy
that is horribly uncomfortable to use,
probably would cripple you
as soon as you start trying to use it,
but it's just adorable.
It's the smallest little pocketable Game Boy.
Oh, it has a charging port that is super predatory.
I can't even find it.
Can't find one online at this point that is reasonable.
So I still need to find that so I can charge it up.
But I just thought it was this--
- Game Boy micro USB, huh?
Yeah, exactly.
I need to find that.
Um, but it was just this super cool little thing that I found when I was looking
through stuff and it kind of made me think like every once in a while, I think I go
through this phase of like, why am I collecting old crap?
You know, like, why do I have 15 different iPhones on a shelf next to my desk?
Like that's so stupid, but.
I don't know.
I just think it's kind of cool to keep stuff from the past every once in a while
and kind of look back at it from a technology standpoint and a, see how far
we've come, but also I think more intriguing to me is just some of the
ideas people had in the past for what was a good idea versus a bad idea.
And this is one of those ones where it was like, they could do it.
So they did it.
And I'm just not sure there was really a reason to do it.
Um, it's just so small.
There's like shoulder buttons.
There's a volume rocker.
Screen brightness.
It has a little speaker, it has a headphone jack in it,
which when you look at it is huge
compared to the actual size of the thing.
It's got, yeah, it's got L and R triggers on it.
The resolution is 240 by 160.
So super high resolution.
The screen--
- Are we talking something about the size
of this Playdead device that's coming out?
Or is it bigger or?
- It's similar to that.
That's kind of more of a square.
This was maybe be like, if you took two of these and stuck them next to each other,
it would probably be about the, I haven't seen a play date in person, but I've
kind of seen like the little AR thing.
I think it's about that size.
So probably about two of these stuck together would be the size of the play date.
The screen size is like, is 51 millimeters, like two inches.
I've been a cozying a cozy art in for an image of the, uh, this thing.
I think I may have found it amongst all the different, there's a trait.
My old technology is building trees.
I love it.
(both laughing)
- I think I found the right one.
I put this in the links, but it's,
so it almost looks like a miniature.
It's a horizontal sort of, this thing's silver.
The picture in this is silver.
Does that sound?
- Yeah, the original one was just, was all silver.
- Right.
- This one, this one is a special one.
It's this gorgeous gold and like dark red.
It just looks good.
If you're a fan of Nintendo or Game Boys
or anything nostalgia in general, you would like this.
- My first ever one I just wanted to add in there
was the Game Boy Color with the ice design,
which was undoubtedly a ripoff
of the whole iMac translucent plastic thing,
but I loved it.
Yeah, and I'd sit there with the little IR blaster
with some of my old friends playing Pokemon.
You couldn't really move away from each other,
but my goodness was that cool at the time.
- I know, wasn't that amazing, the IR thing?
Like that just seemed, that was like space age technology.
That was so mind blowing back when that was a thing.
Like doing this wireless.
- But the fact that it was instant.
It was instant, there was no waiting or anything.
- No more sync cable connected up, none of that.
(laughing)
- And this Game Boy Mini, did it take the Game Boy cartridges
Or was it its own thing?
Uh, it uses the Game Boy Advance cartridges, which is also funny
because the cartridge itself is like two thirds the size of the actual unit.
Oh, and it's slotting to the bottom.
I'm just found another image here.
Yep.
Yep.
It's, it's totally a weird, just some, some engineer was like, Hey, I could do
this and they're like, all right, go for it.
So what games did you have for this?
So the one I have in here right now is Super Mario 3, and that's the only one I can actually find.
I think it might be the only one I kept for this particular system.
And do you remember playing it much or was this like a short-lived?
No, this one was strictly just bought because it was kind of a novelty.
You really don't want to play anything on this for any more than, you know, five minutes.
It's just so uncomfortable to use.
But it's so small it fits in your pocket so it's like it was just such a nice thing to be able to
have a full Game Boy with you at all times before there were phones or anything like that. If you
wanted to play a game you're either dragging around a you know a full-size thing or this
in your back pocket. So it's a it's a weird thing that they'd made and I just I just love it because
'cause it's just so out there.
- You don't get that anymore, do you?
The weird one-off devices.
Everything is a platform now
and everything has so much riding on it that,
apart from maybe that's why the panic game,
what are we calling it?
The yellow thing with the crank?
Playdate.
I think that's probably why that's so fascinating
because it's the only sort of thing
that is being randomly made on a whim.
- Yeah, well, it has to come from a company
that has that kind of risk-taking
and vision to do something like that.
You're not gonna get that from many of these companies now.
They just can't.
There's no--
- It's just too hard.
- It's too driven by, again, the bottom line
that we were talking about before,
to be able to take a risk on something
that might or might not work.
- Now, this will derail things a little bit
from technology, if that's okay,
But after seeing your note there about this new segment,
finding an old thing in your house, Jason,
I did actually stumble upon something
which may challenge your device for pure obscurity.
Would you like to know what it is?
- Oh, absolutely, yeah.
I wanna know about everything old in your house.
- Beautiful.
Well, this is the first old thing,
and I didn't go purposely looking for this.
I actually stumbled upon it when looking
for old Sydney Olympic tickets for a recent episode
of the rumination that I do, and Natasha was on it.
And I found this and it's the Centenary of Federation Medallion for Primary School Students
from 2001.
Do you have any idea what I just said?
I don't, but I'm going to guess.
It sounds like a participation medal that you got at a school sporting event during
some kind of special holiday.
You know what's great about what you just said, you actually assumed even more effort
than what was required to get this medal.
So you're correct that it's a medal, it was given out to everyone, but it wasn't for a
sporting event.
Federation in the context of Australia was when all of the Australian colonies came together
to federate as one nation in 1901.
So in 2001, a hundred years afterwards, after all the brouhaha of the Sydney Olympics, every
Every kid in primary school was hyped up and given this medallion, which I'm holding right
in my hand right now.
And it's hilarious.
It's this circular gold colored medallion with a bunch of kids piecing together the
Australian map and on it is printed, Australia.
It's what we make it.
And it's in this plastic collectors thing.
I'll have to send a picture so we can link it.
But it's even got a little blurb on the back to inspire all young Australians.
What do you make of that?
Oh, so you, you really did nothing for this.
No, no.
We were purely citizens.
We turned up to school, we got a medal,
and just so you know, it was designed by John Skillington
and produced by the Royal Australian Mint.
So they put all the effort in, we did nothing.
So that's what I bring to the table today for this segment.
- Do you know that that brings back a memory?
Now, I was a bit too old to still be in school
when they were giving those out, but--
- Sure.
- I still was given a coin when I was a young boy,
and it was for the, I still remember it,
I remember the folder it came in.
It was for the Bicentennial of Australia.
- Oh.
- So yes, in 1988, that was 200 years post,
what we were educated as the founding
and discovery of Australia in 1788,
when basically white people arrived.
So, and in 1988, we were given a coin
to commemorate the Bicentennial
'cause it was a really big deal.
Wow, you guys are really, really into time-based coins.
- Yeah, it was a lovely coin in a display folder.
And I kept mine, I think I could probably still find mine.
I know my wife has one too.
We're both at school, but yes,
I think basically it was the,
well, probably the conservative governments
trying to maintain the status quo.
- Oh, for sure.
- What are these coins made of?
Are they like a stainless steel or are they kind of an unknown material cased in plastic?
Mine was encased in plastic.
It was a shiny silver, which I don't know.
I don't know about metals very well.
What would that be?
Would it make it nickel plated or something?
I don't know.
It wouldn't have been expensive because they had to produce a few million of them for every
child in school.
So it looked fancy, but I don't think the street value of the coin was very high.
See, I knew bringing this up, Andrew, that you would have to have something similar to
this.
I didn't know what it would be, but Australians just like to hand out stuff like this.
Good on you.
Like whether it's rosemary on Anzac Day, so you can whiff herbs off your school uniform
shirt, you're going to have something.
I probably just confused all the Americans again.
Here it is.
I found a picture of it.
I've got a price on it.
I can give you a price.
- On gumtree.com.au, which is a classified site
here in Australia, you can buy a Bicentennial Memento coin
ranging from $15 up to maybe $25.
Oh, here's one, $5, that must be trashed.
- 15 bucks, I gotta say, that's about $15 more
than I would have expected.
(laughing)
- But it's a real thing, Jason, seriously.
If you go to any Australia post office,
Typically, at least to the ones that I've been to, to the right of the entrance, before
you go up to the counter, there will be display cabinets full of commemorative coins.
If you want something with the Queen's face on it that's different from usual, you can
find it at the post office.
I think Australia has way too much metal.
You guys need to find something better to do with that metal.
This coin thing is really not...
The gauntlet's been thrown down.
You started this segment and you've just been outdone by coins.
I know.
is that that's it I'm stepping it up I'm my challenge is you have to find the
oldest thing in your house that's original oh wow oh okay like not part of
the house just like a thing you have could be given to you could have been
something you bought doesn't matter and it cannot be either of these coins are
we done I think so I think so I feel like like I took this in a weird
direction thanks for that. I don't feel like there's anything better than the coin at this point.
That just kind of...
[MUSIC PLAYING]
