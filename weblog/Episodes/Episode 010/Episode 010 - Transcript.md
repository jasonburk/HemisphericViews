So do we have a time check?
Time check in the hemisphere in which I am in is 4.59am
For me in beautiful Western Australia, a lovely day today, 8.59pm
And for me in the glorious city of Wollongong, 11.59 for another 30 seconds. That is at night, my friends.
Tuesday where I am, Martin, you're about to turn to Wednesday
Yeah, I'm about to travel forwards in time in a truly amazing way.
That's so cool. You get to be in the future all the time.
I watched a thing about Ferris Bueller's Day Off the other day.
It was a reunion show hosted by Josh Gad,
where they got all the cast back from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
And wow, everybody's gotten so old, but what a great movie.
I love that movie and one of my favorite sequences in that is actually not one of the funny sequences,
you know, in the art gallery when they're walking around.
I think that's a great piece of film and they're walking around.
I think it's, uh, please, please, please let me get what I want, but it's covered by dream
academy, but it's instrumental only.
So if you want to hear it, you have to go to YouTube.
And yes, I've done too much, uh, too much accidental research for this moment that I
didn't know that was coming because I'm from the future.
That is totally off the cuff.
We should clear it.
There's been no pre-warning.
This conversation just launched into it and Martin has suddenly just copious amounts of
knowledge.
Incredible.
It does make me very much want to re-watch it though, just for that one little tidbit.
Do you guys have chance?
I mean, I don't watch regular TV anymore in the sense of like cable television or over
the air or whatever, but that kind of stuff would always just be on randomly and you'd
be flipping around and all of a sudden it's like, "Oh look, I'm, you know, four-fifths
through Ferris Bueller. I guess I'll just finish watching this now." I'm assuming that's
just kind of a universal everywhere thing. Oh, definitely. Yeah. I miss that actually,
that sort of that happenstance and the luck that might come from what you might just come
across. And that was so many movies that I have seen, I would not have seen if it hadn't
been for just flipping past and saying, "Yeah, okay." Or just the inertia of whatever I was
watching beforehand and you don't change the channel. That's all gone now.
Yeah, you had like eight channels and if there was nothing on the eight channels,
sorry. Go back to channel six and you're going to watch the thing you thought,
four minutes ago you thought that was a terrible thing to watch. Now it's looking pretty good.
That happened kind of, well, sort of recently. There's a movie that I watch all the time,
called Trading Places. Not sure if either of you have ever seen or heard of it. But
I think I have always seen it in the past on, you know, TV when it would just
be on. So it'd be set, it'd be pretty heavily censored because there's some
there's some stuff in that movie that's it's not all age-appropriate. And a
couple of years ago, we somehow, we always end up watching it at least every year
around Christmas time. It's just kind of like a Christmas movie now. But we ended
up watching it with my mother-in-law, my wife, myself, and my mother-in-law. And I have,
I guess, like the real version on, I think it was just on Plex or something. Somehow
we had it, it must've come off a DVD or something. And wow, was I surprised at all the stuff
that was in there that I don't remember being in there. And of course she's there with us.
I'm just like, oh, okay. Don't remember that happening. But, but, you know, sometimes they
do change things or syndicate it for TV because I know that we had a certain copy of Dumb and Dumber,
which is a family favorite, but then on TV, depending on the time slot, you would see
things removed or added. And I had seen that movie many, many, many, many times. And then it was on
TV. And I went, I have no idea what the hell this sequence is. And I have never ever seen it.
Oh, yeah. So sometimes it actually depends what is showing and talking about serendipitously
Stumbling into different movies one of my all-time favorite movies is the fifth element. You know that Bruce Willis mili of a bitch
Yeah directed by Luke Besson
I'm seeing shaking of the head. It's terrible. I'm gonna disregard that maybe it's not it's great
It's very quirky. If you like blue opera singers with tentacles coming out of their heads. It's good stuff
And all the time whenever I visit the in-laws they have free-to-air TV on and when we don't really do that
everything's just through the Apple TV still free-to-air, but internet driven and
It's on all the time on the Australian Network
SBS and we just find ourselves sitting there staring at the same sequences of the fifth element repeatedly
And it's good but other times like I think I've become known in that house for walking in and they're just
Sitting down watching some movie and I go. Oh, is it X or is it Y and they go? Oh, yeah
How'd you know that? Is it a good movie? And I'm like, nah, I've never seen it and they just go
How the hell do you know these movies that you've never even seen? I saw it on the poster somewhere
So I don't know if that's an almanac knowledge, but you know, I'm an expert at
Identifying films that I've never seen so you guys have over-the-air
TV that they then pipe through the internet to you via Apple TV
Yeah, yeah, so the two main apps worth watching here
If you're regarded as a leftist by the mainstream Australian media media
ABC iview so Australian Broadcasting Corporation or SBS on Demand which is the special broadcasting service or to anyone who doesn't watch it and
Follow stereotypes it stands for sex before soccer
Because you always see raunchy French films before English Premier League comes on and they have apps so that you can watch the free-to-air
Livestream or their programs. That's pretty much TV for me now. I'm assuming that's related to the BBC iPlayer
Yeah, they licensed they licensed the technology from BBC as it's essentially the same
[Music]
Jason seems to be just drinking a little bit of mud there out of a mason jar.
A lot of coffee at 4.45 in the morning.
I'm really, I'm horrible at mornings. I'm a terrible morning person. I don't do mornings
at all. I don't really do nights either anymore, I guess. I just don't really do.
Yeah, barely. I'm just like hanging on by a thread, just existing.
Hang on, he's done a switcheroo.
He's just pulled a...
Oh, yeah.
That's something you should probably know.
I don't know why, but I will always have no less than two
and usually no more than four beverages going at any given time.
I just like to have variety.
I like to know that at any time, I can pick and choose which path
I'm going to go down from a beverage standpoint.
So I may go coffee to water to something else.
we don't know. For people who can't see he's gone from a mason jar as Andrew said to a can of
something. Is this some sort of palate cleanser? Are you going between dairy sips here? Yeah
basically so I've got my standard ball mason jar of coffee and then a... Is that hot coffee or cold
coffee? This is cold brew coffee that I made yesterday. So your standard sit in a cup for 24
hours kind of thing. So it's really old brew not cold brew. It is old brew it is
but it's just it's you know it with age just it really gets that extra depth.
That's a good way to put it. I love cold coffee. I don't know what is your stance
I know we're very different in the coffee realm anyway you don't consider
this to be coffee but in the summertime which it is there now I assume cold
Cold coffee is like acceptable because it's 3000 degrees there?
Not really.
No, wow.
You're crazy.
I'm just thinking like American coffee because it wasn't bad enough already.
We're going to serve it to you a day old and cold.
Cold brewed coffee is the best.
So you don't like cold coffee, Andrew?
At all?
Not just cold brew, but all varieties?
Not in a big way, unless it's one of those ones you buy from the deli out of the fridge,
You know, it's got like a, you know, it's like cold with milk mixed through, you know,
like a...
A US Santory sort of...
Oh, the Japanese.
I think I've mixed up the...
The Japanese stuff.
No, I've had that from time to time.
I'm talking about the stuff that's in like a plastic bottle, you know, and it's predominantly
milk and sugar and a little bit of coffee flavor.
Are we talking oak and deer here?
Like classic Australian kill hungry...
I'm not that bad.
I don't...
Those are too hard.
here that's like a little bit upper end, you know, so it's like that sort of that sort of stuff but
a bit more real coffee than that. I kind of remember what it's called now. Well to chime
in here I do enjoy an iced latte which is a very controversial point in itself because if you say
iced latte people will look at you like you're some poncy freak and then assume that you want
a litre of syrup thrown in and maybe some whipped cream on top and that's when you step in and say
no that's an iced coffee and they go but wouldn't an iced coffee be a coffee with ice and I say well
will look, they took that word and adopted it and made it something else.
So now I'm going around ordering a latte with ice in it.
So that's the one that I like.
Um, but yeah, you're right, Jason, it's very controversial here and look, you can
keep your cold brew if that makes you happy.
And then, okay, so that's cool.
We've hammered you about your coffee now.
What else have you got on that little shelf?
Um, I have an Apple wallet.
Tell us about that.
Does that count?
It only took over a month to get here.
I don't know why, but I ordered it day one,
and boy, did it take a long time to get here.
I think the package probably stuck to the side of the postal truck,
and it just drove around the city for weeks until it finally fell off.
I think it's fantastic.
I thought it was being handmade in Versailles or something.
It's really, really nice.
It's a very, very premium feeling, well-made little wallet.
I had a kind of previously thin wallet before, so this is not really that different.
Three cards, I would say, is max.
I have two credit cards and an ID.
I think you could probably...
No, I would say three.
Three is probably really all you want to do with this.
And then it just sticks right to the back of the phone.
It's very simple.
So the wallet is great.
I think everybody needed clicks to get, you know, their articles monetized or whatever.
So it was this big, like, Oh my God, the wallet shoots off and your identity gets stolen.
It's like, what are you talking about?
It's so it just magnets to the back of the phone and you put it in your pocket.
Like it's really simple.
The wallet is really nice.
It's great.
I mean, it's, it's a little bit costly.
And if you're the kind of person that carries around a lot of crap, you're not going to
like it.
Do you have any temptation to carry it around on its own rather than attached to the phone?
Like, would you go out with Apple Watch only and wallet?
Yeah, absolutely.
I'm not losing anything by moving to this other than I don't have cash in it.
So I don't really know what I'm going to do about that.
But I would definitely use it just as a wallet on its own
and just throw it in my pocket.
The one issue I have with the wallet is that it's essentially redundant
for my way of living, because all I need, really,
if I'm talking minimal cards, was it two or three cards that can fit inside it?
So it would be a credit card,
which I already have linked to my Apple Pay on my phone, and then an FPOST card,
which is really only used to get cash out in an ATM.
Um, and who does that?
And it's, it's a bit kind of pointless.
And then if I got the cash out, I wouldn't have anywhere to put it.
Cause I've only got the Apple watch, Apple, Apple wallet.
So it's a bit like, why would I even bother in the first place?
I think the ID is the only thing for me that's that's there's no other way to do it yet.
We don't have any kind of ID that can go in Apple wallet.
A lot of times you just you have to have an ID for a lot of different random stupid things
and it's one of those your ID is the thing you'll never need until you don't have it
with you and then all of a sudden everybody wants to see the damn thing for one reason
or another.
So you just have to have it with you.
Incoming message from the future.
message from the future here in the state of New South Wales we have digital
licenses on here iPhone course you how does that make you feel of course you do
so let me get this straight so you don't wait hold on me do my check here you
don't have Apple pay cash but that's correct you have a damn driver's license
on your phone correct and it even when you use the accelerometer when you tilt
the phone it does that little wavy pattern thing which is what you would
normally have on a license to show that it's not counterfeit I'm glad that
we're showing on the phone that it's not counterfeit. It's beautiful. Yeah. But the, the, the thing
that troubles me a bit is that if you get pulled over by a police officer, right. And
they say, show us your license and you produce a phone. Where's that going? You're holding
a phone when you're in the car, they're going to, Oh, you know, if someone's having a bad
day, they pin it on you. I don't know. I mean, it's very specific problem, but otherwise
I enjoy it. That's the one drawback I see is that there's no way in hell I'm handing
XYZ random police person my phone to just take you're not gonna scramble for the accessibility settings
To enact, you know guided access for the police, but can you just hold on while I apply my passcode? Yeah
It's hard enough now when you just go to use Apple pay and now with like a mask on
You're like that person that's paying with a check all over
And the check people always carry a pen I've never carried a pen and I've always found that
Interesting have either of you ever carried a pen in your pocket? No, I think maybe twice the the ink risk
Yeah, the ink risk terrifies me only if I know I'm gonna need it. I'd lose it. I'd lose a pen
I always thought it'd be cool to carry a pen like one of those little like Fischer space space pens or something
Like you could be the pen guy
Never happened. I just don't like having stuff. Yeah, I don't like carrying stuff
My brother carries around a Mont Blanc pen. Wow. That's a lot. Oh, yeah, he's just showing off
But but look I've been around people who've produced pens
When they're needed and the smug look on their face when that moment comes and they go, you know what I've carried
I've been carrying this pen
Yeah for the last two decades and finally my moment has come probably with the check that they brought
I'll tell you what in the before times when you would travel on an airplane and you would go into another country and have to
fill in one of those um
Yeah arrival car a shit thing. Yeah, you've got a plane of 300 people and I swear about four pens
You got a pen. Oh my can you borrow your pen and suddenly the pen from from row 27 up at row 12
Covered ready
It's not gonna be like that anymore
Did you know did you know we have been talking for?
About 20 minutes and we're yet to hit item one on our run sheet
Yes, I did know that 21 minutes 54 seconds actually we're good at this podcasting thing
It's organic as the the Millennials say the social media people efficiency. All right. Well, let's get to it. Okay, so
Now I have a question for you Jason
Which is actually something that was posed to you in our public discord and I feel like now's a good time to bring it up
Your attitude towards the touch bar. Oh
Okay
Touch bar. Let's get real here for a minute
The Touch Bar, for some reason, much like my little Apple Wallet, people just love to hate it.
And it's so bizarre to me.
I think the best thing that I can come up with in terms of an analogy of sorts is, think back pre-iPhone.
We had what was considered to be the pinnacle of phones, the BlackBerry.
Everyone loved the BlackBerry. I had many of them. They were pretty great little phone/communicator devices.
What was the problem with the BlackBerry? Half of your device was taken up by a hardware plastic keyboard.
Which was a great pro of the BlackBerry. You had this great little keyboard.
but half your device was dedicated to a single task.
Why?
Why the hell do we want that?
So flash forward to your keyboard that has looked the same
since the beginning of time.
And they said, well, let's change this up a little bit.
We got that whole top row of keys.
Most people probably don't even use those keys,
you know, with all the function keys.
Nobody even knows, like F14, who the hell, who cares?
Nobody uses that.
So let's turn that into some usable space again
and have it dynamically change to be responsive to what you're actually doing.
So we got that with the Touch Bar and it just no one seemed to get it and I'm not sure why.
I think it's absolutely a wonderful implementation for the keyboard.
My only complaint about the Touch Bar is I don't have it everywhere.
So kind of like Touch ID where you only have it on your laptop but then if you're on an iMac
you don't have it. It just sucks when you don't have it because you get used to a certain way
of doing things and then have to change it up. So on my MacBook Pro, I have the touch
bar and I use it all the time as if it's just a natural extension of the computer. I think
it's fantastic. I don't know if either of you, I don't think either of you have one
because you don't have a MacBook Pro with it. No, no, no, it's great. I've never had
the time and experience with it to be offended. Like I have no justification. I think it's
I think it's a cool idea as long as it's maintained and Apple does stuff with it.
I know the escape key was a very controversial thing which they've since returned, so each
their own about whether that was a mistake or not.
But look, I think it's a good idea in general.
An example, when I go back and forth between an office and home, and I'd be in conference
rooms and stuff a lot at work, and so I would use Better Touch tool to create little buttons
for the various places where I was.
So I would walk into my office at work, hit a button, everything would arrange itself
the way I wanted it to be.
I'd walk into certain conference rooms that had weird setups, I'd hit a button and it
would set everything up the way I needed it to be likewise when I came home.
So I just had little customized buttons that were on the touch bar.
Yeah, it could be keyboard shortcuts, but why not have a nice little graphic that says,
you know, office, conference one, conference, whatever.
Again, just having that ability to further customize things to be more in line with where
I'm at contextually.
And the other thing with the touch bar is I think it's a little bit of chicken and egg
where everybody wants to hate it.
So the people that actually create these applications don't make their application work well with
the touch bar because they quote hate the touch bar.
Well, it's not going to get better if you don't make your damn app work with it.
Yes, it takes a little bit of effort,
but if you actually implement the functions within your app,
your app gets better and the people
that use the touch bar can enjoy it.
Some of the apps that I think are great with it,
Safari is, I mean, a lot of the Apple apps,
obviously because they make it, but Safari is great.
Fantastical is good with the touch bar.
Drafts is another good one.
Bear, Apple Mail, of course.
IA Writer is another one.
I use that a lot for doing different text manipulation,
pages, numbers, keynote, obviously.
You can even do crazy things with it.
You know, if you start talking about like BetterTouchTool,
they have a whole section where you can just go insane
with what you wanna do with it.
There's like tool sets that are basically
BetterTouchTool bundles that just go through
and make it a wholly separate device.
People have done crazy things with this.
So if you just look, not very hard,
You can find a lot of really good uses for it.
I think the only problem with it is that it's not everywhere, much like touch ID.
If there were a standalone Apple keyboard that had a touch ID sensor and a touch
bar strip on it, I think it would be a killer.
Anything to add to Andrew?
No, I think that last point is exactly what I was thinking is that that non
ubiquity is what holds it back because it's not everywhere.
Nobody supports it and it just doesn't get traction.
If every single device they sold had it,
whether you wanted it or not,
I think it would really start to do something.
And the fact that it's not on the consumer level products,
I think is sending a particular message as well.
It's saying, "Hey, this is for pros."
But it's the pros who probably hate it
more than the normals.
I think, you know, most people,
if they can have a button like in Pages
and make their text bold or italic,
Yeah, how many normal people, normal iMac users would be like,
"Oh, this is fantastic."
And they haven't pitched it at that market.
They've just, they've gone the wrong direction.
- Yeah, to me, this whole thing gets down to the issue
with the word pro as a modifier or a moniker for this product
because for half of the people who use it or want to use it,
it's aspirational.
They're thinking, "Oh, I can be a pro-presumer, pro-juicer,
whatever word you want to use, just professional
if I use this and have the tools."
Whereas the other half are people who have been using it for years,
whether it's the developers you identified, Jason, or filmmakers, music makers, whatever.
And they actually see themselves as professional,
and this encroaches on the keyboard that they've always known and liked,
or they think it's getting in the way or shining in their faces in dark editing environments.
So again, I think we're just seeing more and more of these things bubble to the surface
or be mentioned on podcasts or tweeted about
because it's just becoming so much more of a popular product.
people who never used it before are coming to love it, and other people have legacy or
nostalgia about what it was and don't like certain things changing for better or worse.
So I think the word pro is a bit of a problem term sometimes.
Especially now with all these M1 Macs where like this, the cheapest possible thing you
can buy just absolutely destroys any quote pro machine you have.
Picking up on what you just said Jason about the M1, I will be brief about this. I do want
talk very briefly about my M1 addition to the family. I did receive the Mac Mini with the M1
Apple Silicon chip very recently and I have to say that for me personally it is a revelation.
People can say what they want about, you know, integrated stuff on a chip or what's the RAM
all about or what does this mean for M2 or M3. I just want to say to people,
Whatever. This is the nature of technology. Whether or not Apple is making the chip or it's Intel or
someone else, stop looking at the future for one second because I'm already there in many ways as
we've ascertained. Just enjoy the products that you have. I can tell you upgrading from my 2014
Mac Mini, which I loved anyway but was a much maligned computer because it dropped certain
things. I'm seeing the love heart on Skype from Andrew, thank you. This is a great computer. You
couple all the things together like the fact that I was going from a Fusion Drive to an SSD,
increased RAM, Apple Silicon, Big Sur. There are lots of different things for me personally which
might not come down to just the chip itself but it's a great improvement. So I'm just saying if
you want to get an M1 Mac but you're worried about the future and where it's going, if that's the
case you would never buy any device because it's going to be eclipsed eventually. So I'm happy with
with my purchase decision personally.
- I didn't realize you had a fusion drive before.
So this is, I mean, I knew this was a huge upgrade
in terms of processor and memory and all that,
but the fusion drive to these new SSDs,
that just has to be crazy fast.
'Cause I think the new SSDs are even faster
than the ones we thought were too fast already.
- Yeah, that's totally right.
And look, my computer, oldish as it was,
was always fast at launching applications.
any things that were stored on the SSD,
the most commonly used applications,
to be honest, I don't notice too much of a difference
in terms of app launch generally,
some things are faster,
but it's things like opening up the photos library
and skimming back years upon years,
and it's just buttery smooth.
So yeah, it's when your personal data comes into it
that it's really noticeable, at least for me.
- Has anything not worked for you so far
in terms of just it being,
I mean, I know a lot of the stuff still runs in Rosetta 2, which you probably can't even
tell, which that's a whole thing in itself that is mind boggling that they're able to
do.
But have you had anything just flat out not work or you had to do some kind of weird dance
to make it function?
Or is it just basically drop it in and everything's as it was?
Nothing has been broken.
The biggest thing that I had that was close to a worry was audio hijack for this very
set of podcast recordings that we do. But there you go, Rogue Amoeba, they got onto it. They've
already done the beta or beta, depending on your hemisphere, the beta software. And we're running
it, you know, I'm running it right now. Other apps are opening beautifully. I'm super pleased to have
the iOS version of Overcast sitting in my dock now. Occasionally, there's some weirdness about
suddenly the Mac goes, oh, you have Overcast here, but it doesn't exist. Would you like to open it?
"Oh, let's open a new version to the right hand side of the dock" and you sort of have two icons
at once. I think it's a bit of a glitch in the way that it saves the app on your computer, but
in terms of it running, I mean it's technically an iPad version so it sizes beautifully, things are
scaled really nicely, so you can tell that when developers put that extra bit of effort into an
iPhone or an iPad app even before making it Mac Catalyst, it does work pretty well in this system.
So I suppose what I'd say is that if this is the beginning of the transition,
I have full confidence in what they're doing. It's really impressive.
And for the iOS stuff,
you just go and go to the regular store and you searched overcast and it just
showed up because you're on an M one or is there like a segregated part of the
store?
You have to go to your purchase list.
You go to your purchase list and it shows you in two separate tabs,
the Mac ones or the iPad and iPhone one.
So it is slightly deliberately hidden just so you don't stumble on stuff.
And I think that's a good move because most of the stuff in there that I've downloaded
because I'm sure you two are the same, like you download heaps of stuff over the years
just to try it out.
Most of it's useless and I would never want it on my Mac.
So the vast majority of stuff is just rubbish and you don't want it anyway.
But for those things that you do want to use, it's so nice to have the actual app that I
use on my watch, my iPhone, my iPad in sync and not trying to go to the website or load
up Apple podcasts instead, because Apple podcast is fine on the Mac, but it's not the one that
I want to use. So here it is. Fantastic. Well, that's great. I'm really happy to hear that
because I've, I've heard nothing but good things about them. M one max, um, which is
honestly surprising considering the, you know, tech sphere that just, you know, has something
negative about everything, but so far everybody seems to think that they're great. So I, yeah,
I'm jealous that I don't have one.
I want one obviously, but I still nothing I need.
I'm really pleased to hear how happy you are, Martin, because I have one coming.
I ordered, I ordered ultimately, ultimately I did the, the MacBook Air,
MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro debate incessantly for a number of days,
weeks. Ultimately I went with the MacBook Air. Very good. And so I got the 16GB 512GB SSD,
but I have to wait until almost Christmas for it to arrive. So shipping is delayed.
I think these things are in great demand, but I'm in no real rush because it's a, it's
going to be a second computer for me. It's going to be the one that means I can be once
again freed from my desk. This is the first time I've had a Mac that's not been a laptop,
having this iMac in front of me now. It's been great for the last year, but I have started
to miss not being able to do computing somewhere else. And that was the whole thing with me,
like thinking about the iPad Pro as well versus the MacBook. I have tried so many times to
get myself into iPad Pro, become the iPad Pro guy. It just doesn't work. And I thought
When you added up the cost, I think you'd almost get to the point where the iPad Pro,
by the time you added in the keyboard and pencil and all those bits and pieces, it becomes
a more expensive proposition.
And just a clumsier one, when ultimately, if I'm being honest with myself, I'm a computer
guy, I'm not iPad guy.
As much as I enjoy the iPad, if I really want to get productive, I do it on a Mac.
I do it with things like Keyboard Maestro, yeah, and Audio Hijack, and all sorts of different
little tweaks, and you know, I use LaunchBar, like that makes me so fast, and I'm just so
much more productive on a Mac.
So yeah, I went with the MacBook Air.
Why that and not the Pro?
Partly the TouchBar, like I've never had one, so I can't say I don't like it, but I also
don't, I've never had it, so I won't miss it.
And then the other things were screen brightness, which is I usually run it less than 100% anyway.
So who cares?
And the microphone thing and like I never use laptop microphones, I'll plug in airpods
or something like that.
So I thought for having that and the fanless, I thought, well, it'd be nice to have a quiet
laptop.
And I've never had a MacBook Air.
So this will be a new thing for me.
So I'm really excited.
Just got to wait for it to turn up.
I think you'll love it.
I got a dongle today, though.
My first dongle arrived.
So that's good.
I'm entering Dongletown.
Is it in the spreadsheet?
The Dongle's consumable.
You don't have to worry about tracking that.
It's consumable.
How much is that Dongle per week is the question?
Oh, goodness me.
Well, I think you'll love it.
You're extending your computing into a new area.
And for me, people might look at me and go, why did you spend that much money to put something
on your desk that looks exactly like the old thing?
For me, it's reassuring that everything else is the same.
It just slots in and it's much, much faster.
So I think the beautiful thing here is that whether you're an iPad guy or a Mac guy, quite
clearly they're very into extending all of their platforms at the moment.
There's a good future for all of these things and they're all kind of converging and diverging
in their own ways.
But I think it's a great time to be a user of this stuff.
The fact that you could take the exact same thing, it's not that you could change the
RAM in your old Mac Mini, it's that you could just change the whole compute unit and plug
it directly right in to where the other one was and be right back going with stuff that
is probably thousands of times faster in some respects. I don't know what the numbers are,
but that's pretty incredible that you're able to do that with almost no effort in terms
of just take the old one out, put the new one in.
No fuss. Everything stayed the same. The cables just had to be unplugged and plugged into
the next thing. Unbelievable.
Like the rant the RAM is replaceable. The hard drive is replaceable. It's called the whole unit you just swap it in
It's not just about the RAM or the or the hard drive whatever, right?
It's like it's the whole computer the whole architecture the whole pipeline has to be updated
Just throwing in new RAM wouldn't make the RAM faster
Whereas with this route you have the whole pipeline gets changed out, which is a much bigger deal
But at the end of the day you have a much better overall experience
Yeah, exactly. It's like I'm sitting at the same desk, but it feels like a new one essentially
Did you not replace the cables? Did you leave your old power cable and that kind of thing? You didn't take the new one?
Oh look, maybe I exaggerated. No, I did use the new one. I apologize a lot. The last one was black
So I'm just curious because even if they look the same I still would have used the new cable just for the cleanliness factor
So I paid for this new cable
Yes dust free for a limited time only
Media corner
We're going to media corner now. Are we in media corner?
All right. I've got three the first is a TV series one that has been raved about and everybody knows about so it's no big
Breaking news, but I've been in George Ted lasso. No, but it could be because it is that good
This one is I'm finally catching on way behind. It's the crown
[Music]
We... it's a historical biopic? I don't know, what do you call these things?
Like a historical dramatized version of a person's life? The life of Queen Elizabeth?
Her Majesty? Just excellent. I'm only up to season three.
There's four seasons. I've only just gotten into season three.
Really excellent. Amazing acting. The sets are incredible.
I don't know how they do it. It's on Netflix watch it next gaming right?
This is another ancient game
But an ancient game that I become obsessed with from time to time and I'm going through another obsessed period
XCOM 2 it is a turn-based
Strategy game where you basically are a bunch of humans trying to defeat the evil aliens
Will you have a range of different soldiers that you equip with various guns snipers and machine guns and swords?
I did not see you as an XCOM 2 guy, man. I love it
I love it because it's I didn't see him as a monarchist, but we're learning lots today. So XCOM 2 it's so great
It's frustrating it can be difficult, but it's satisfying because it's not reaction based
So I'm an old bloke these days who's got time for fast twitch fibers and reflexes
Now none of that you can step away from any time
So it's kid-friendly but not so good friendly because just the last couple of days my almost five year old son
Benjamin has discovered XCOM and is now playing with me
He comes in and I say push number one now push enter and he gets to shoot
The aliens and he loves it and then we play XCOM in the lounge room
So he becomes a big zombie and I have to pretend to shoot him. What are you playing this on?
This is on my iMac, but I boot into Windows with a SSD drive that I connect by USB C
To boot camp external boot camp, which was a bit hacky to get that to work
There's another story for another day, but it can be done last one a music music
I don't think we talked about this before
it's a cover of karma police the Radiohead song and it's by a group called scary pockets and
They play kind of like they do a lot of this cover work and they sort of turn it into sort of jazz lounge music
But this karma police cover is absolutely brilliant. I
Love it. So jump on to that one. You've actually reminded me this wasn't in my media corner thing
But you've reminded me that ballpark music the Australian band did a fantastic cover of paranoid Android on triple J's like a version
I don't know if people listening know what triple J's like a version is
We're just adding more things for Jason to link in the show notes, but triple J is part of the ABC in Australia
But it's like the offshoot radio station for people who don't shower
and
Yeah, they do a segment every Friday where they get someone to come in to do an original work and a cover
So yeah, karma police paranoid Android. We've got a bit of a
Radio theme then great. That's good
My yeah, I was there were big when I was that age to be completely depressed and you know
Realizing that my life wasn't worth living and all that. And so yes, Radiohead. Wow, the theme songs of my teenage-dom
And then the crown saved you. Jason, are you next?
Yeah, I'll continue on. So we get to do is it 11
different things in Media Corner now? I thought it was one, but I got excited.
Okay, I'll expand my list for next time. It's Multimedia Corner. I only have one thing
Sorry, I only have one.
Mine is going to be...
It actually only came up because it recently got a little bit of an addition.
So this is a...
It's a game again, and it's called What the Golf?
Question mark.
Oh, yes.
This game is...
It's for everyone.
If you play this and don't have fun, I'm sorry, because this is just a great game.
It's not for me.
What?
There's not even a backpack in the game.
How do you not like this game?
Because it's not golf.
That's the point.
I want to play golf.
I don't want to hit pianos.
So what the golf is like a weird physics-y, not really, you don't really get to do whatever
you want, but you have quite a bit of latitude on what you want to do with each hole.
And as was pointed out, it is not golf in the strict sense of golf, but it's lightly
golf themed, I would say.
golf stuff in it and you for example you go like through one hole and you instead
of hitting the ball you like go to hit it and your whole body flies across the
the hole to get to the flag. It's insane there's really no way to explain it you
just have to play it. If you have Apple Arcade you have it already. It's on Steam
it's on I think it's on Nintendo Switch now. It's basically everywhere and it's
just it's a fun game you can have on your phone that just doesn't make sense
You don't have to try there's no effort involved and it's just got a lot of little funny punny jokes in it
And if you're into that kind of stupid humor, you'll enjoy this but they did just add on another
kind of winter
Level pack thing to it which got me thinking about it again
Which I went through and played immediately and finished in one run. But yeah what the golf
It's just fun. It's catchy and if you're anyone in the world
except one person on this podcast, you will absolutely love what the golf.
I have to say it made me enjoy playing a game on tvOS. So if that isn't some divine miracle,
I just I just want to play some golf. Very good. So do you have 10 more things, Jason?
Or that's next time I do. Yeah. No, I've got only one. I followed the rules.
Okay, cool. Well, I have one, but I do have a prior honorable mention that a listener
sent in, Greg said, Are you going to talk about Round the Twist? And I thought, you know what,
I haven't watched that recently. So it doesn't qualify as my main mention. But Round the Twist
is a fantastic show. Very Australian, if you're unaware of it, it's a great children's series,
which probably sometimes wasn't really for children, because it was a little bit terrifying
or creepy. It's about Tony Twist, a widower with his three young kids, one of whom is called
Bronson which is hilarious enough and they live in a lighthouse in a I think the name of it was
Port Noranda, Noranda with an N for Nelly, fictitious place on the Victorian coast and it
was based on the books by Paul Jennings, an English Australian author who did a whole heap of great
short stories for kids so if you haven't heard of Round the Twist I'd encourage you to go look it
up. I'm sure we'll find some link to put in the show notes, we'll see what we can put there but
see if it's something that you in fact can watch yourself because if you can watch something about
a creepy doll walking around a lighthouse and your kids can too then that's amazing.
So thanks Greg for that suggestion. Moving on to my own other one. I feel this is probably even
weirder than when I brought up Bajas so I don't know how this is going to go but yeah I'm just
gonna I'm just gonna talk about it. Right so just in case I haven't mentioned before Natasha's
background is Greek. Okay, so her grandparents, Greek, moved over here. Her parents were born
here but it's a Greek family. It's a Greek fest. I don't speak Greek but they're lovely,
we all have a good time and we all follow along, everyone can speak English. There is
the occasional experience though where we visit her Iyar's place, that's one of her grandmothers,
and she is absolutely obsessed with this show called Kalo Mesimeraki, which as far as I'm
I'm aware basically translates to have a good lunch, or like good midday to you. It's like
a cheeky way of saying it. And this is the weirdest show that I've ever seen. Right?
The weirdest show. There's a guy called Nikos Moutsinas, who I doubt either of you ever
heard of him ever heard of him? No, he has over 700,000 followers on Instagram. He is
an absolute machine in terms of television hosting. And this guy essentially hosts Greece's
most popular midday program where he just slams and mocks all other elements of pop culture,
all in Greek. And we go over there, and she's just got it endlessly playing on YouTube. She
loves it. And I have absolutely no idea what's going on half the time. But you sit there,
absolutely mesmerized. Are either of you familiar with Gogglebox? Where you watch people watching
things? Yes. No. Okay, Jason, you're not familiar with it. Essentially, you watch people watching
TV. It's a thing I think in Britain and Australia. But this is another level where he's looking
directly at the camera while actually watching the thing that is displayed next to you and
he is commentating and reacting to it. But because he's staring straight through the
TV you feel like you're involved in the program. And after every single thing that he mocks
music starts playing by this band called, and I'm not kidding, Alcatrash to the side
of the stage and they dance around and then everything freezes, it goes to the next segment
and your eyes start to water because they never keep the zoom the same.
So as he's speaking, the zoom of the lens is constantly like going in and out and panning
around and then at the end of that thing, guess what happens?
Surprise, surprise, the music kicks in and they all start dancing again onto the next
segment.
It's the most bizarre thing you've ever seen and I encourage you to watch it even if you
have no idea what's happening.
Wow. I don't even know what part of that to dissect first. Alcatrash is a fantastic band
name, first of all. I want to hear what they have to say, because that sounds perfect.
And this is on YouTube?
Well, that's the thing. Natasha's here, watches it on YouTube, and lots of other Greeks are
obsessed with it as well. I think there's one other person in the family who hates it.
It can be quite divisive, but yeah, and then when people have visited, they've stuck it
on ours.
We don't even watch it.
And now it's in my YouTube recommendations.
I've got Nikos Moutsinas from Kalo Mesimeraki, his face constantly at me in my YouTube recommendations.
So we don't need a VPN into Greece to be able to watch this?
No, you can duck onto YouTube and watch as much Greek midday television as you like.
There'll be no less than three links in the show notes for this, so don't worry.
Oh, they'll be there.
It can't be any worse than having my recommendations polluted by Roblox and Turbo Toy Time.
True, that does sound worse.
I'm concerned about your further recommendations in the future.
I don't know how much more off the road you can get now, because you had the Bajas thing
and now...
You said that very well.
Say that again.
How on earth did you do that?
didn't even pronounce the hours I'm very impressed I've been watching it
continuously since it was mentioned last time did you enjoy it or were you
sickened no I thought it was I thought it was actually pretty funny because it
very much had a and I think I even said this to you guys really like a mystery
science theater 3000 kind of vibe to it so I very much appreciated that because
I watched that religiously when I was younger perfect well another media
corner comes to a close.
And does that bring to a close yet another episode of Hemispheric Views?
