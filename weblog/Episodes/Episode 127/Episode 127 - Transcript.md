Here we go starting the show with it there is a store in japan called hard off so yeah hard off book off there's several offs um hard off being the most interesting choice probably so what's hard off mean for that shop what does that mean uh hardware it's uh it's a chain of different stores that revolve around um reselling of goods instead of just like chucking them in the bin it's like a it's like a physical ebay if you will oh so yeah it's pretty it's a it's a great store you get some good buys in there see i know hard off is like the tiebreaker segment from abc tv's hard quiz so whenever they have yeah andrew's nodding too so whenever you have two people have the same scores and they need to eliminate someone tom gleason the host goes it's time for a bloody hard off and shakes his hands oh a bloody hard off oh that that's a bloody escalates that's last show of the year 20 and 24 here we are episode 127 how does it feel does it feel like you thought it would feel being at the end of the year andrew looks confused martin doesn't care perfect moving on so it feels weird in the sense that um you know it's another year it's the calendar who cares you just go to the next thing and everyone's like happy new year new resolution you know whatever everything just goes back into place but it feels weird that we have to kind of call it out on the show and then when you listen back it's like oh this was the time of you that they talk about certain things like it's not i think a lot of our episodes unless we do happen to mention something this happened in the apple calendar which we don't do a lot of really anymore when you think about it it's like it's not really time bound in the archive you could go back to episode 78 whatever the hell whatever rubbish we were talking about on that episode and it could probably just be today unless there's some massive infrastructural difference between the two microphone setups and the knowledge management and something like oh we can tell andrew had this microphone that day before he sold that one yeah you'd have to check the backlinks to make sure that you were in the correct timeline but more or less yeah evergreen so in the show notes it says that we're meant to be down martin but i can see that he's quite clearly here no he is here yeah i double checked and he is in fact uh here recording with us right now i'll just get this out of the way i didn't know if i was going to be here and it said that in the notes because we were expecting our second child we didn't know when that would come and as i announced you know i tried to be fairly modest on micro.blog uh we welcomed our second child our daughter nia into the world so that has happened and i carved thank you very much carved out this little bit of time this um half hour or so to come and join my uh lovely co-hosts and all of you listeners so yes that's why andrew's editing has now compounded in difficulty because i'm actually here i don't know about january who knows like it's it's a busy time and i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to do it in the next couple of days i'm functioning on not excellent sleep at the moment which is kind of predictable not complaining it's the thing that comes with it but we're very happy and i apologize to anyone if i don't fully form my thoughts in this episode we'll see how we go but no everything's going well and natasha's a champion for everything she did over that period i did a lot less as the man congratulations to you both yes indeed it's a momentous occasion thank you we'll be sure to send you an additional one prime plus onesie or a onesie prime plus if you will and we're also proud of our latest one prime plus member see that see that that was just like didn't even know it was coming patrick g thank you for joining us in one prime plus in the tail end of 2024 you snuck in there you thought i'll just join in 2025 but you said wait no i need to juice those numbers for 2024 to get that balance sheet looking a little more green so thank you patrick g no and look you know from my point of view i really appreciate it when i first saw it i was actually going to veto the membership um because i saw patrick and uh yeah i misread the g for c c right because it's just one little nubbin just a nubbin on the g that changes just a nubbin and i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to do that but i'm going to do that and i was like patrick c my brother i do not want him as part of this show no no i'm not having him as a stakeholder i'm not having his him trying to buy his way onto this show i was going to say no veto but then i realized it was patrick g and i was like ah bring it on did you think patrick c was attempting some kind of like hostile takeover situation or that's yeah yeah he is a bit of a corporate raider as well so you have to watch out for him at all times so it was like is that patrick c coming in and trying to take over this podcast show no patrick g you're more than welcome it's in the long game thank you patrick g and we look forward to uh having all of you in 2025 or uh all the new people that want to join oneprimeplus.com martin do you have something to add i did the opening one so i'm happy to let you two kind of on that one just trailing off sad trombone actually no look i will say i welcome all patrick's regardless of their uh second edition i don't all right well thank you for uh restricting that patrick's go away yeah every new patrick will go through a vetting process and we will have a an impartial vote don't worry so please please join oneprimeplus.com all right so i'm seeing the notes here it says at andrew likes paper but there's no basketball next to it so i feel like it's something that jason wrote to make andrew talk about or andrew was lazy even though you put yeah i did yeah yeah he was he was going on and on about something called paper i didn't know if he meant the kind that comes from trees if this is some new ai application i don't know what it is lay it on me oh look um it's another yet another markdown writing app oh boy because we haven't got enough of those um and it's it's lovely look it's very expensive i just wanted to put that out on the and and i was kindly gifted a code to get access to the app whoa is this is this disclosure are we in disclosure right now uh well yeah i guess so okay so i i'm not i haven't paid for it i've just been using a little bit i don't even know i feel like i've been put on the spot because i don't think i've really had enough time to really use it this is already a great time to use it i'm not going to use it i'm not going to use it i'm not great segment i didn't buy it i don't know much about it i i yeah get paper it looks nice it does markdown um it's it uses like the file provider system so it's not really one of those library apps like ia writer or ulysses it's more a um just a document management app like like a microsoft word for uh markdown files that's unfair isn't it that doesn't sound that's really unfair that does not sound bad that's a bad review this guy's listening to it he's thinking oh great they're going to talk about my app paper i'm going to get huge juice from this review from canyon and i'm called comparing it to microsoft word which is not fair and i i rescind that comment they have award-winning templates but what i love about is that there's there's some lovely little animations like when you look the cursor kind of animates in but probably the thing that i love most about this app this is going to sound like a nothing but it's typewriter mode is it like ia writers typewriter mode because i love that i use that on the mac so when i said typewriter i mean it's like when you type you're not your cursor is not the bottom of the window all the time it like kind of it brings everything into like the center of it and and adjusts the view of the document to where you're writing it's like centers it is that what you mean correct correct and when but when you do it it's it's a little bit different because it's even almost more like a typewriter in that you go on to the next line and then you have to wait a moment and then it just kind of like chunks it just chunks up in this kind of like animation which is a little bit jarring at first because it happens like a couple of characters into the next line but there's something about it that is nice do you have to like shove your monitor over like it's a ribbon or like what what's the people are jamming that's for sure that's uh is there an accessory you have to purchase for this to be able to attach to your monitor how does this work this is a terrible review um are you sure you're not actually just using a typewriter and you didn't have glasses on or something that's what i'm wondering yeah are you feeding paper into the top of this machine oh my gosh look it's a nice app it has lots of the features you would expect from a feature field markdown app okay so we can expect a follow-up follow-up review probably probably okay i'll tell you what i'm so glad that when i first did that artwork you know that how we have the podcast chapter artwork for different segments people checking in overcast pocketcast whatever you use um app corner remember it started off with a bit of doubt like is this uh what and i put that question mark on it i'm pretty sure it's there i really feel like this is the this is corner we don't know what this is so yep perfect moving on in the future i'll just say that i i often use this as a reference to my work but i don't use it as a reference to my work but i often put random stuff in the notes like feel free to to delete them if you don't oh that doesn't seem fair okay that was the worst software review i've ever done that was that was terrible i i loved it i loved every i was on the edge of my seat i mean i'd say it was it was positive in the sense that you've left plenty of room for listener and user interpretation they can fill in the gaps and get back to us on discord mastered on micro.blog um maybe even write a review in paper and then share it with us can i say one other thing there is no chrome in the uis it's like a it's like a sheet of paper like literally this white box probably where the name but and that's a pro you're you're giving that one as a pro oh i like that yeah i like it looks clean elegant yeah yeah so this actually feeds in beautifully to my next question i had of both of you is um does it i'm keen to see how it does reviews and segues there's right up there with each other i don't believe that anybody actually has to lie somebody does good start not many people at my work know that i do this podcast um this one or just podcasting in general mainly they know i've done a i think a few people know that i'm somewhat connected it's kind of doing basketball stuff even though that's kind of faded more recently i think it's a bit more widely known but this one is very it's a bit it's a bit underground and probably should stay that way if they listen and they hear that review of paper and they think god that goes really crap at podcasting um i'm just wondering do people at your work know that you do this podcast and then secondly have they ever listened to it so i know martin has a couple of people that know but does it go more broadly than that it's it's different for me i suppose because all of the stuff that i do and ultimately i'm not a podcasting fan but i'm a podcasting fan so i'm not a podcasting fan but i'm a podcasting fan so i'm not a podcasting fan what led to meeting you two was because i started doing like a part-time phd in the area right tech podcasting specifically anyway it's kind of a thing that's known online through your accounts or something that you share through work right and so from there it kind of i don't say spiraled out of control but it certainly blossomed right because i was doing some solo stuff people have heard this story on the on the podcast before you know how we all kind of began through the podcasting and so fortunately i have a very uh supportive and involved manager a direct manager at work who you know he's fantastic and he uh his name's craig outing him there um he listens to this show a lot of the time he heard what i was doing and has that fantastic interest in you know the mac and technology and all this stuff anyway and was even on that lounge room lounge ruminator show that i've done before and he encouraged it and said well do you want to do like this sort of stuff even at work and i said well i'm not a podcasting fan so i'm not a podcasting fan so i'm not a podcasting fan so i'm not a podcasting fan so i'm not a podcasting fan so i'm not a podcasting fan so i wouldn't say that everyone necessarily knows about hemispheric views at work because you know it's a certain interest and audience and you know we don't want to kind of bore people like i'm just going to do this podcast but you know i've had support at work people have heard about it shared things and other projects and opportunities have come up through work where i'm kind of at least partially known for being the guy who does the podcast stuff so i'm super grateful that i've been able to share this interest in what we do here and experiment with other stuff elsewhere at work and personally so yes the answer is yes but i don't trumpet it too much so i was not to bore people it's all i talk about at work frankly um i yeah i can't i don't believe you i can't shut up about it it's just like every day three or four people are telling me to shut up stop we we know we were subscribed we've we've liked and subscribed uh no i people know about it um i know a few have i don't know if they're in there now have been in and out of the discord from time to time um i'm at a small company so it's like it's it's gonna come up like there's not you know we do we do off sites and stuff we talk about stuff outside of work and it just comes up so yeah i talk about it not i don't like bring it up like oh by the way did you know i do like no but it totally comes up from time to time um i think it's just it just depends on the person though like it's not a show for everyone like i recognize that like if you i think because that you know me it's and you if you're kind of already like attuned to my ways and means you'll be like okay i could kind of see like maybe how that could be a thing um but also i mean people just you know people don't have all the time in the world so i i appreciate when people listen to anything at all like i don't expect people to subscribe or anything but if they hear one or two cool um so yeah i think it's it's interesting and also kind of weird because it's just like whole other like life that you have almost um it's it's like a weird hobby but a hobby that they could listen in on i guess that's maybe the best way to say it where like you can be like oh i build tiny robots and they're like okay that sounds weird or cool or whatever but this is something where they're like listening to it actively what it is so it becomes it's just different i think in that respect yeah but um you bring up interesting points there because something that comes to my mind is the whole kind of thing that you have different personas in different areas so this is something that if people listen to really specific stories which is like the explicit research podcast for my project it's something that i kind of asked about occasionally because people would bring it up you know who are you on different things and thinking about this question you've asked andrew and who we are on this show really show it's us like listeners right now you're hearing jason andrew and martin but it's really the hemispheric views version of us it's not a lie but this is a dynamic that you're hearing and then i start to think well i do the other research one and i'm playing a different role there you take on a different persona andrew you'd be different in your basketball one the one i do for work uh i'll mention it for the sake of linking although i don't expect people to listen to it because it's called voices of bluescope and it's about people in their their working backgrounds projects all that sort of thing so that's a different kind of you know quote unquote professional martin's paid employment version of himself so yeah people know about this at work but you don't want to kind of push it on people because it's maybe a different version of yourself i don't know if you both relate to that it's it's like friend groups right like you're you're different with different people it's just like you're the the person that you need to be in the situation with the other people to make the most i don't know like free-flowing a conversation and like you're going to talk about things you all are interested in you're not going to you're not going to go to your basketball friends and like talk about computer chips like they don't give a shit right so like why would you you can have like multiple kind of venn diagrams and stuff and i feel like this is that where we have our kind of dynamic that's maybe different than andrew would have in a what we might have on a different show or whatever so yeah and then work is just work like you're everyone has like a work persona that's as much as you try to be like yourself like you have to be in work mode so well you want to know martin's work persona actually maybe there's a lot of crossover you know what i mean i think you would just hit you just think foot martin's just constant foot everywhere right my work persona is if you're going to send me a message right please make sure that it says you know hi martin how are you and then has what you want following that greeting don't just send a message with hi how's it going and then leave that radio silence oh you know what would be my favorite thing in the whole world if we could do what is it um is it is it larping is that the thing where you do like real life live action live action role play i want to do that with us like in an office environment for like two weeks straight where we have to like actually deliver something god how much fun would that be we have to like we have to use like teams and office 365 and i could just say hi to martin and then not say anything else for another hour just we could have cubicles how much fun would that be oh god okay okay so jason uh that's been this has been a good discussion look i've got another meeting uh in the conference room at quarter past two so if we can just make sure that martin you've got the minutes on this one yep and if we just run over the action items one more time so everybody's clear on what they're trying to achieve yeah and uh then we will move forward okay being conscious of time uh oh and i hope both of you are okay with the fact that this meeting has been recorded by staying you have given your consent yeah we wouldn't talk to each other after that two weeks but god it would be great it would just be great we joke although i will say look where where i work teams actually works really well i'm uh i'm a fan of the uh even if the software isn't my favorite and we discussed this before i'm not going to go over it again oh no good kind of uh team flow as per the name i actually would sing at least uh where i work i would sing the praises of how it's generally used by most people okay okay i'm just gonna ask one thing of microsoft actually i'm gonna ask two things microsoft developers you have to say to certain way a lot of money two questions two questions two requests do you reckon do you reckon there's any chance microsoft that you might be able to teams on your operating system that is called windows what are the odds that we could get teams having to have more than one window whoa i know crazy and then teams let's say because of your shit one window design i need to go between chat and then teams and then how about you remember my my location in the directory structure of the team that i was in rather than jumping me back to the start every single fucking time do you know the amount of productivity loss in just having to click through the directory structure of somebody else's creation but so because it's not mine it's 17 layers deep archive archive 24 25 archive archive joe's stuff archive come on microsoft it's not too much to ask so is there a question in there or is that i know i think that was just 12 months of teams rant why can't you why can't you make two windows microsoft okay that's my question can you please make teams support more than one window secondly microsoft can you please make teams remember file location when you switch position view when your viewport changes maybe consider that i want to go back to that previous viewport oh look i've got i've got more but i'm going to leave it at that i i agree i agree the multi-billion gazillion dollar company microsoft every freaking person in the world is using this if you added up the lost productivity time of just that alone oh my god oh i didn't say didn't say that coming but there you go it's been a long year would you like to segue masterfully andrew to the next segment uh which is about features yeah jason you maybe yep i yeah i did not expect i didn't expect when i was digging that whole hole to uh to strike oil with that but thank you and um we'll have hr contact you um post this call to to resolve any of your issues um speaking of windows do you either of you use any of the new ios or mac os features because i use i use exactly one i think and i was just curious and wait let me preface this with no this is not an introduction to rant i literally just want to know are there any features that you mac os 15 ios 18 watch os whatever uh andrew i'm gonna i'm gonna let you go first okay okay all right well i don't think i i used them in the i played with them a little bit and i've included a result of said play oh i hate that in the show notes here it's it's not pretty i hate um we could probably include that in the show notes i i actually asked image playgrounds to use to create a picture of me holding a like with a potato that was don't ask why i asked that but just go with it okay it's drawn me it it looks a little like me in a sort of a cursed way if you were lobotomized i think it looks like you i'm kind of like one of those caricature heads like my head is gigantic compared to my body i have i have like hands that are totally misshapen and two different shapes two different sizes uh and then the the the cherry on top is actually not a cherry it's a potato because it's giving me a hat that it looks like a hat with earrings that looks like a potato i don't know how to describe it it's the most i was gonna say it's like a headdress it's like a ceremonial headdress made out of a banana shaped potato with one knob on each end it's very strange it's like it's like you're the queen amandala of spadoo so so in the sense that do i use features i used that one um and i am using the male categorization features because they've been foisted upon me that is my answer you can turn them off i haven't gotten around to it you just just got the top right and you can turn it off i don't want to be mr negative but it's also not on ipad it's only on iphone which is another weird thing but anyway that's all i'm doing oh and and i keep triggering um the new like the siri when you touch the swipey bar oh jeez sorry shouldn't have said that you know when you touch the swipey bar at the bottom and it activates it i keep doing that by mistake you okay you good yeah i'm good okay uh martin yeah so um what have i been using uh i haven't used this a lot and i didn't think that i would but it's one of those things that wow when you do have it how handy is that so that new continuity feature the iphone mirroring app um haven't used it a lot but there have been a few cases where for example something like discord on the mac was mucking up or not letting me attach a file or a or a photo or something so my phone was there i turned on iphone mirroring and then was able to use the discord app on my phone crossing something from icloud drive by controlling my phone from my mac and i thought how good's that so i actually got around like a bug in the desktop version controlling my phone from my desktop computer it was great really good other than that not using it all the time but again very handy when it comes up the send later feature in messages there have been times when i've had to send a message but it was too early to do it or it was overnight and i could see that the person the recipient didn't have something like do not disturb or silence notifications on so i could go oh my god i'm not going to do that so i've thought of this now i don't have to set a reminder for myself i'll schedule the message to happen at this time in the morning when i when i know they're going to be up perfect it works other than that let me think what else has there been i don't really have access to any of the apple intelligence stuff on any of my devices so not really i will say that i do appreciate some of the new things in the photos app even though i'm not convinced about the redesign things like those little trips collections that it puts in have you guys looked at that and i'm not sure if you've those yeah it's kind of like memories but trip specific they've been really nice they've been great too um probably some of my favorite things although they're not really i mean i suppose it's tied to sequoia in the sense that you should be keeping up with updates but some of the improvements in the latest final cut pro have been fantastic even just the way that it has like a transcription tool built into the editing software you don't have to go somewhere else than load the srt file or the text file in to match up with the footage it actually just does it then puts all little transcript boxes in there are lots of little nice you know quality of life improvements or little utilitarian fixes that i've um quite appreciated oh and the other thing is i like the new uh ios home screen customization options for things like app icon size and color which i think we've discussed before so yeah nothing groundbreaking but oh that's nice and final cut pro is the same version that i bought back in 2004 or whatever and it still just keeps getting updated which is really it's phenomenal great i think it's like the crowning achievement of like apple's software offerings or mix it's just it's an utter pleasure to use and you just get all this stuff and jason i'm sorry i probably focused in my response on the the ai particular features that's right in mind rather than the broader software features you would not be you know i forgive you completely because that's the only damn thing that has been talked about for the last 18 years in all of the marketing materials and it's still barely here so well i'll tell you and i'm going to sound maybe controversial i actually i don't like uh text and image generation stuff generally image less so because i think you get some creative results but when i when i write or type any kind of suggestion even from outlook like do you want to put this word in i turn it off because you've interrupted the flow of my sentence i think um the whole thing is that i'm not going to go on too much of a rant but i will just say i don't like the idea of a computer suggesting the text that you should write even for like creative inspiration um if you really have writer's block or maybe you do struggle with writing or there's certain challenges you've had i'm not going to discount that or say you shouldn't do it but i think that if it's a matter of laziness as apple has actually actively advertised have you seen the ad where it's like the guy at work who like is you know can't be bothered and then he sends the email it's like did he really write this apple's own advertising is actually kind of promoted dishonesty at work and it's that whole kind of angle of apple intelligence and chat gpt and stuff that i don't like so i kind of actively avoid that you both fired up this time this is great but that's it i'm not going to say it's bad for everyone because there are creative uses but for me personally i think it's disruptive i don't particularly like it and if it means that people don't actually invest in their writing when they probably could if they tried i'm not into that all right there you go i um i use iphone mirror a lot i think it's great and i don't care about any of the other dumb crap very good so you don't want to you don't want a potato in your head not really no i don't um i don't find value in that um yeah there's there's been a lot a lot of build-up for a nothing burger i just i don't i don't understand i i genuinely just don't maybe like i i like to think that i'm the dumb one that just doesn't get it like i don't have the vision or whatever but like when i see like the the what is it the image uh the plague whatever it's called image yeah image playground i just i can't fathom or understand like i have a picture of someone that's already them that's real why do i put that into a machine to get a shitter version of that back to me that's not them i i just don't get it like i'm so i'm genuinely confused and i'm not just being like ai hater or whatever like i just don't understand why i would want that i haven't seen anybody use you i haven't i've heard nobody really in the real world nobody's talking about this stuff i've not seen anybody showing evidence of using it yeah it's weird i think do you know what i find kind of annoying and unsettling about all the ai stuff this is how i'd put it and i know some people might roll their eyes when i bring up a bit of a steve jobs element to this but it's more about a quote which i think he himself borrowed over many many years you heard him say you know it's not a quote it's a statement of the mind right it should enable or quicken or make more efficient certain you know productive or creative processes if you look at something like adobe photoshop or pixelmator pro or a video editing suite like premiere or final cut pro just focusing on creative stuff for the moment that is enabling through technological work a human's productive or creative practice right it is not you know it is being a bicycle for the mind all of these things are essentially at this stage marketed or gimmicky replacement for the mind you don't have to write anything you don't have to create an image it'll just do it for you and it won't even be that good so i think the thing that's unsettling is that it's that replacement aspect it's trying to circumvent your mind rather than enable or enhance it that's what bothers me is that i'm all for augmenting a person like make me better make me not have to do mundane boring crap that i don't want to do but why replace me that it just doesn't that does not i don't understand how you try to sell something something to someone as a way to replace the person you're selling it to like i that doesn't that seems at odds to me but again i'm i'm not a tech billionaire so maybe i just don't get it imagine if all of the hype and enthusiasm was centered around uh or centered on the innovations for people who you know control their computer through eye movements yeah imagine if people went look at this innovation that enables people through technology and accessibility that would be fantastic not i can't be bothered to try this thing or maybe even pay someone on fiverr to make an image i'll just get a crap version by a computer instead like celebrate actual help yeah like accessibility could be huge right like you have screen readers which are they're fine but it feels like they could be a hell of a lot better or this stuff that's about like type in a thing and get an image picture just describe really detailed what this image is for somebody that can't see it that's seems way more empowering than um andrew with with quote-unquote hands and a potato on his head although it is amusing and i'm glad that he did it to bring it up here so i don't want to shit on it entirely it has its comedic value yeah thank you and i also i was gonna ask you what the prompt was because i thought it was something to do my guess would have been western australia uh ambassador to the big potato is what i was guessing that the prompt was going to be he's dressed up for the robertson pie shop i was wrong clearly i just wanted to bring up uh something that you both you know near and dear to both your hearts unannounced trivia corner oh we're not this is not an episode of unannounced trivia corner this is the results of unannounced trivia corner there's never results what are you oh my friend let me tell you this is unannounced this is this is the results of unannounced trivia trivia corner results um drum roll please drum roll drum roll at the end of 2024 after millennia of uh unannounced trivia corners i am happy to announce that we are at a dead tie between martin and andrew so unannounced trivia corner will continue to be a hot topic for you guys i'm going to be a hot topic for you guys i'm going to be a hot topic for you guys i'm going to be a hot topic for you guys i'm going to continue in 2025 are you kidding i thought for sure i would be losing by a few points no you serious we're actually talking i'm absolutely serious you're actually going back through the answers are you i've been keeping track of them since day one in a spreadsheet wow i thought you would be but sometimes i just wasn't sure so we go into 2025 at a tie and uh good luck to you both in 2025 for unannounced trivia corner you man wow that's that's big thank you so much martin you got one more topic left what do you want to what do you want to tackle in your last topic of 2024 um let's go for any standout favorites from this year oh yeah that's a good one i put this in here this this is this could be like a hardware thing a software thing a book a movie a mute like whatever just anything that you kind of thought this year maybe it was unexpected that you didn't think you were going to be so into that you're into or just something you're like hey that was a really good book probably should have prefaced this before we started recording so you could have thought about it but that's not what we're doing that would have been would have been a hell well do you want to start us off then jason because clearly you've thought about it no i haven't thought about it at all i was just going to throw this out to both of you all right well something specific to the show and i'm not choosing it just because i came up with it i'm choosing it because i'm glad about you know or glad with where it went counter chat right it hasn't been the biggest thing this year but i was just so pleased that as a segment in this show because you know let's face it i'm normally the one chatting to people over counters andrew embraced it you know he really went out there started having some chats with people you know and sometimes not with the results that he was expecting and i'm glad that he shared those on the show but i also love jason that you have really just dug in and you don't want to do it yeah and i just think that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's really just fulfills the characters of this show i think it's beautiful and i want to thank everyone out there who has shared something maybe in the discord maybe online and look that's where i you said unannounced trivia corners back in 2025 there will certainly be more counter chats as long as i'm living and breathing i'm going to be talking to someone over a counter but aside from this show uh favorite things this year probably should mention again having a daughter that's like the standout uh pretty good kind of development this year but maybe media wise things that you like uh not to be too heavy on the apple train but really have enjoyed the series on apple tv plus this year uh shrinking that's been a lot of fun i i'm always kind of welcoming in life particularly as things get busier things in i suppose the political or geopolitical sphere continue to get more stressful and aggravating just a really good light-hearted comedy i keep seeking out just you know happier music uh comedic shows and and and films to share not just to watch myself but with family so that's not to avoid hardship in the world but i just like to try to find things that you know not all of your media consumption has to be really serious as well um yeah maybe i should have prepared better but i didn't know that was the case but yeah just things like that have been great that's great okay i've got a couple um so my first one i'll do a computery related thing standout favorite for the year it's got to be the the og macbook air m1 why is it a favorite it's like four years old that's exactly why it's my favorite i have bought a new computer this year and yet the m1 i'm still finding use i'm basically it's become a dedicated work machine and i'm allowing my m4 to just be the the home machine um but the the m1 four years old it's still like a million times better than the hp piece of crap that is sort of the work issued computer it's incredible the thing does not feel old or slow in any way it's lovely it's the it's incredible considering that was their first crack at the new architecture just in an insane piece of hardware so it's great i love it um more broadly probably my other favorite thing metal metal pegs stainless steel pegs wow we're talking for like clotheslines right washing lines yeah oh yeah if you have if you're still using plastic pegs in 2024 and especially 2025 you need to just get rid of those things go straight into the coiled spring metal they're stainless they slip on they slip off they don't mark your clothes they they're easy to deal with the only danger is on a hot per day of 41 degrees they can get a little toasty in the hand if you've left them out of the water they can get a little toasty in the hand if you've left them outside apart from that stainless steel pegs where the future um i will i will round us out with just one word and i will say photography i think would be the one for me for 2024 um loved it for as long as i can remember it goes in waves you have up years and down years of of active inactive but i think this year i feel like it's been a really good year for me and for for photography for both taking pictures making pictures being into pictures we started another podcast about photography it's just been a very good wind up and and and momentum and i've also had a very good journey with my tools so cameras software tools for editing and so forth it's been uh it's been really good so i think that would be my probably my very broad top category would just be photography in general and appreciating it uh or getting back to a place of appreciation that has always been there but i hadn't hadn't given it the time that it deserved well that's great and you're bringing up like the photocast as well i suppose i should say broadly i would have prepared uh better for this but maybe good that you sprang it on us jason even just this podcast right i'm grateful that people continue to listen to this show i love talking to you two uh each week and connecting when possible online with the people who still very kindly support this show and subscribe so it's just nice to look back and go maintaining this thing and it's a creative work and people get something out of it because i'll be honest like for me uh and natasha it's been a pretty stressful year like we're talking all this kind of home repair and crap stuff at home with you know flooding and strata things that's a long boring story but um you know it weighs on you and you've got work and things to do with family and stuff and it's just nice to have you know people in your family and kind of network of friends to you know have a laugh with so i'm grateful for you too i'm grateful for my family uh it's just it's great and hope that it continues for ages doing this podcast and martin if you do considering the flooding and everything you've had you've probably had some had some lots of wet clothes to deal with um when you're hanging them on the line everyday quality of life improvement stainless steel pegs now i know it's it every day everyday micro abrasions not paper cuts micro abrasions that just annoy your life don't worry i remember we learned that word from iphone 7 i was gonna say jet black iphone 7 you don't want that you don't want those micro no way i think we had a show title micro abrasions we go full circle don't we well on the topic of micro abrasions overcoming the micro abrasions of life right through podcasting through this dialogue i want to thank you both i'm going to leave at this point because you know this is the show that just always changes we've been doing it for years we don't always change we don't always change we don't always have our microphones set up properly uh sometimes i leave sometimes andrew just walks out of the scene and comes back with the cable often jason you've got cats like you just get involved i do i'm just gonna leave now and you two can have the after show of your dreams to take us out of uh 2024 if you want to do that all right we'll see you uh maybe next year maybe not who knows we'll see or andrew will just hit cut and that'll be it and see everyone we could be done depends on who's editing i don't even know i don't even know it's a mystery well i'm gonna stop pre-countdown and thank you both for understanding thanks for all of your understanding and see you next year goodbye merry christmas catch you later happy holidays right now he's gone do you leave no he's still here hold on ah there we go now he's gone what a oh finally glad to get rid of him oh he wasn't even meant to be here four years ruined the whole show he keeps showing up god when's he gonna get the hint oh we should change our zoom code we should yeah i think it's i think at this point we'll and we'll just blame it on the new year and be like oh i don't know what happened zoom it's like it's like office space you know they never really fired milton they just kept sending him further and further away just fix the glitch you know we'll just change our zoom code martin may join the old one he may not but it'll just work itself out uh what do you think do we want to do want to tackle any more of this what's his fitty whatever like what's his fitty whatever like what's his fitty whatever why do people move around so much that sounds like a bit of an annoyance rant that you've put in there yeah kind of i think it's a misunderstanding fundamental misunderstanding of how this is all supposed to work are you finding the social network situation i'm just not understanding like this whole thing is supposed to be like federated and they're all connected and all that stuff but yet why does everybody keep moving servers like every third day they're all connected what does it matter where you are i don't understand i've been on the same one since day one and like i could see all the same people what what am i missing i'm glad that you've said that i'm glad you've said that because sometimes i feel a bit stupid about this because they talk about yeah the federa it's going to be federated and you could follow it and all it's done for me is people still rant about oh i need to join blue sky i need to be on blue sky why and then well do i go on it with my existing like micro.blog username somehow or do i just create a blog and then i just go on it and i go on it and i just go on it and i just go on it and i just go on it and i just go on it and i just go on it and i just go on it and i just go on it and i just go on it and i just go on it and i just blue sky account which is what i did but that's not really federation that's me being two different people in two different places right yeah it's like what what am i i don't get it and if i don't get it what hope is there for anybody else which is i think why people just say join blue sky because everybody just wants it to be like twitter was i don't i don't get that either but what what do you want though what do people actually want i'm not understanding what people want i don't know and like i don't think i want mass federation like i want micro blog to be my like bloggy circle and then i want what i would like from blue skies to be my basketball hangout area i actually don't want those two characters or personas to mix because it would just annoy both groups so i i'm not yeah i don't know i just i keep seeing like the same people hey so and so is following you i'm like i thought they already and then i see that it's just the same person at a different server but i'm like what i don't know do you follow them again and then do you know it all just three times or it all it all just reconnects and i'm like why are we doing this i don't know anyway that's my that's my uh federated media i joined mastodon like two years ago haven't changed a thing and it's been fine so i don't know well see so i've got mastodon and i've got micro blog and micro blog connects to matt but i've got two usernames and i don't know whether i should be bringing those together or not oh boy i don't want to break it it's like yeah so it's just too confusing for me um i did have a note in here that when martin left we were going to change all of which we already talked about changing the zoom password so we'll take care of that yep yep that's i've contacted it already um is there any other corporate tooling or infrastructure that we should change while martin is away well we should use microsoft teams from this point forward okay so just flat out don't even use zoom why are we paying for a zoom account when i'm sure i have microsoft teams bundled somewhere i definitely don't want to install that well it's just one window it's not that big a deal oh yeah i heard somebody actually recently i heard was complaining about uh it being one window that's true okay so i'll play the tape back and i'll i'll reassess how that goes okay so maybe we go to teams is there any other corporate tooling we could go back to um we need to find a way to get this whole show running on obsidian yeah i think that's where ultimately we need to get to that's what i'm working on i'm working on that in the background that's one of my that's one of my personal dev um you know we each get a certain number of days per week for personal development i'm working on that uh working on that train for us so more to come i think the only other thing is i just i feel like it's way too early to to tease so that seems like the perfect time to do it is when you really don't know where any of this is going to go and that's new merch for 2025 did you hear that just now that was like in star wars when the death star like blows up the planet it was like that but people being excited about new merch are we having a brand refresh uh i don't know if i would go with a brand refresh but definitely a merch store refresh are you excited about that does that excite you i am it does hopefully this i hope there's stickers you don't really have to buy them i'll just send them to you i mean if you want to buy them count me in for 10 yeah uh new stickers new um undisclosed items that you can bleep right now so people don't hear what they are and i'm i'm pretty excited about it i'm not 100 sure it's going to work out i'm waiting on some some contractual items to come through you know papers documents signatures all of that but um i think we're gonna have some pretty exciting stuff in 2025 for uh for new merch so prime plus members new merch that's you know anybody that just wants merch that's everybody we're talking everybody across the board here so get in now get in early oh one prime plus.com nice now i have one further question to ask of you it was also going to be for martin but i already know martin's answer martin's answer would be no because he is responsible and sensible yeah so i'm just going to ask you uh do you ever jump scare your partner no intention intentionally no like hide in a closet and jump out at them and frighten them yes definitely not no why not unintentionally that happens probably more than it should where it's just like hello i'm here now um i know i wouldn't want that to be done to me so i would not do that to anyone else no that's too the only jump scares that happen at our house halloween when people come to the door to get candy and we have a a fog machine that i watch them on a monitor from inside and when they get up to go grab it i blast them with the fog machine it scares the crap out of them that's the only jump scares that happen here that is a good jump scare is this something you're actively engaging in well not actively but what i found is that um yeah i can i can just walk into a room like totally no no intention of jump scaring and i can create a jump scare situation without with no intention of doing it just like you said just walking in and going hi do you think it's that giant potato on your head that's that's causing that maybe but a couple of times i have to admit a couple of times i have just been compelled to do a jump scare situation and it's it's juvenile yeah and it's probably cruel yeah i'm sure probably stop but it's also just really funny and is that just evil of me is this a reciprocal thing though is it is it does it go both ways no oh no it doesn't okay no so i think i should probably stop yeah at least the intentional ones but unintentional that's not on me is it what are you gonna do i mean sometimes you just walk in a room and you're terrifying and that just that's the way it goes yeah yeah yeah and that's generally most of the time what it is what what's generally here is this like a 70 30 80 20 80 20 okay yeah yeah it's a Pareto principle once again maybe if you could get that up to like a like a 95 5 or a 90 10 okay it might be more acceptable okay all right i'll i'll work on that that's that's an error from that's that's that's a goal for 2025 2025 yeah let's get those numbers let's get those numbers up you know i think you're performing well but i think going in to 2025 i think from an okr standpoint i think a 90 10 is something to shoot for okay i haven't thought about okay okay ours in a long time yeah it's probably for the best do you do okay i don't want to talk about it oh you do oh god you do bloody hell wow yeah so you're so you're so american yeah yeah it's a three-letter thing how can you not do it anything that's three letters like you have to do it if it's got an acronym you're doing it like that's true it's important to someone just make that number go up jason make it go up yeah by how much we don't know don't know just change the scale make it look arrhythmic it's more impressive you don't put any kind of indicators on the x or y and it's that graph looks great or another little trick i learned that if you just stretch the graph out it makes it look more favorable landscape printing okay i like it that's why graphs always look so good on slides because they're widescreen genius yeah you look at it on a phone and in in portrait oh that's a big drop off yeah you want to turn that sideways this is exactly why we should have that two weeks of corporate development time yep we're gonna change the world that would be so that would legitimately be fun i would love that and we could film it it could be like a youtube series it would be great would we come out like would we wear ties and stuff i think that's part of the charm is that we would just do what you think you would have a tie obviously i would work i would wear shorts and martin would have like he'd come in with the baby the baby beyond sling
