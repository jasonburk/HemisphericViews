Jason takes us on a wonderful tour of tech history and critique, covering the home row, mobile devices and ringtones (yes, ringtones). Meanwhile, Andrew completes his media-consumption homework and for part of it (hint: _The Matrix_ franchise) Martin sighs a lot. 

**WARNING**: Media Corner contains spoilers for _The Matrix_ films, so skip this chapter in your podcast player if you wish to avoid these.
