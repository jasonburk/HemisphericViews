Martin's day for not his personal day for the room decor is it be minimized it has been this is like this list stuff in the room.
There used to be a rug and now the rug is on your body.
So.
[Music]
Is there anything you want to say? Are you okay? Is this still a good time to record?
Yeah, yeah, look, for everyone who's very confused and listening like,
what's wrong with Martin's study? It's the fact that I've arrived unannounced, shirtless to record.
And there's a very good reason for that and it's actually follow-up for this episode
from the last episode
listeners may recall that I was absent and
in that time my two lovely co-hosts decided to
impersonate me I
Don't recall that happening. Yeah, it did happen. Yeah loved it. It was great and it was one thing about
Martin's all about the hard out. He has to go right you might recall that I recall that
Yeah, now there are two reasons for the hard outs
I have to say which have a good first one is generally at this time of a Sunday afternoon
We end up heading to a family event. So it's like got a run. The other reason is that I don't know if you to realize the
Temperature sacrifice that I make in this room every time we record it's about 30 degrees outside
I have to have that door closed because Max asleep
I can't open the window for noise and I can't turn my fan on
So every time we record I lose all bodily fluids to this desk chair. Just hope you're grateful for that
So now you get to see the full-felled at least the top half
So is the bottom half in a similar state of undress? No, because then I would stick to the chair
I actually have shorts on yeah, that is that is some relief
But I'll send a stage to the right thing by is that time.
Did you actually miss me absolutely are you kidding me it was weird and it was strange when there's when somebody is away it's it's just odd.
Yeah but it was a great episode I loved hearing it as a non participant.
I'm a bit of a weirdo it was great and the fact that I could just drop my little bit at the end so convenient.
And even that week we couldn't leave that alone we had to interrupt you even with that your little monologue.
Yeah yeah I was actually to be honest I was amused and mildly annoyed.
I thought you would be.
It was like 95% amusement and 5% of it's funny that's okay so well done.
I wasn't expecting that and it happened well there we go.
Okay right so it was Andrew's fault because it was Jason's voice.
Yes yes but Jason didn't know it was.
I thought Jason.
I sliced that out of context and then you provided the perfect segue into the context again so it was like just.
Yeah that got cut from before it in the Seinfeld thing and then you said Seinfeld it was like oh boy.
As soon as I heard you say that I was like, oh no, he's going to put it in there.
Oh, yep, there it is.
Okay.
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
What are you doing?
What's new?
How have you changed?
Have I changed?
Well, I'm not wearing shirts anymore.
That's a start.
No, it was really good.
So thanks to listeners for tolerating my absence, I suppose.
No, it was a work trip.
I was with my team over in Aotearoa, New Zealand,
and it was a bit of a site tour for the company I work with,
steel manufacturing sites,
doing a lot of video, photo, and interview work.
And it was really cool,
'cause we got to see some stuff around the North Island,
but also all of this behind the scenes,
industrial stuff that even as an employee of the company,
I didn't really know very well.
So cool stuff happens over there,
and it was a good trip,
and you two got to have some fun in my absence.
And I made sure to take some photos
that didn't really have so much to do with the work
and pop them on my Glass account.
So if you wanna see some molten iron
and steel and slag material, you know where to go.
- So cool.
And that one where they're like drawing the wire.
Oh, I love that.
Love that.
- Well, that doesn't happen as much over here,
at least the sites that I normally see.
So that was cool to witness.
- I love a good wire drawing.
- I'm not sure it was cool.
I think it was more choice bro.
Oh, sweet is.
Oh yeah.
Thank you to our New Zealand based listeners, but still, you know, sticking with us.
Do we, do we have confirmation that we have any listeners from New Zealand?
I believe we have at least one.
Okay.
I'm thinking, I'm thinking Miraz from micro.blog may, may tune in from time to time.
Up until this segment.
Yeah.
Well, yeah.
We're not after post this segment it's over, but okay.
I'm trying to think I'm spinning my mind trying to think rapidly think of another key way thing I could say maybe it's best that you don't.
I can't do it it's about funny you're thinking about the two of you impersonating another accent as though you couldn't understand it.
We understand that we just like to point it out.
Okay, so we've got photos from Martin from New Zealand, which everybody can see.
And was there any other New Zealand tidbits that you'd like to share before we traverse
out of Travel Corner?
Given we've spoken about coffee before, I want to give a big shout out to the baristas
of the North Island.
We did not have one bad coffee in the country.
Hot, consistent.
if the beans were different, it was just super, super smooth.
So a big shout out.
Thank you, New Zealand, for awesome coffee.
This year for One Prime Plus, we've changed it up.
Yes.
We've got bonus episodes.
We've got new stickers, new stickers for 2023 even.
So if you're a previous One Prime Pluser, there's new stickers to get.
And I know everybody wants them.
Not sure how to get them to you yet, but I'll figure that out.
We do live events, not, I wouldn't say regularly, but pretty often.
We do movie watches as a group where we basically all just talk over a movie and ruin it and it's fun.
And it's guaranteed to happen in the time zone, inconvenient to you because of the global nature.
Yeah, it is. Yeah, because of the nature of there being hemispheric views,
it will almost never be in the correct time zone, no matter what time we pick to do it.
Shout out to our listeners from Great Britain and Samoa.
Thank you.
Yes.
Yeah, they get screwed pretty regularly.
How's that 4am time slot?
Yes.
Not great.
Two new people have signed up since we last recorded an episode.
Jeez.
Who are these people?
So I want to thank, coming in big time with the double J's, Jonathan J.
Jonathan J.
Welcome to One Prime Plus.
That is fantastic.
We also have potentially potentially a famous author. I thought was maybe dead, but who knows what's going on here
But I thank them. Anyway, we have a Harper L. Thank you for joining one prime plus. This is amazing
Two new members one prime plus just you know, we're gonna this is a moonshot
We're going outside the hemispheric views the way this is going. We're gonna be planetary views
It's any day now any day now actually, you know, I'm gonna do something
First of all, thank these two new subscribers.
I'm going to do something that's again, like the shirt thing, completely atypical for me.
Oh boy.
TRO New Zealand's clearly changed me.
I'm going to throw out something in the process of recording and actually ask listeners what
they want.
One prime plus people, right?
Jason, Andrew, you're not a big fan of writing newsletters, right?
No, no.
So up until now, newsletter hasn't gone out.
I'm going to put it to One Prime Plus people and I could be completely shot down and refused.
I want to know, do you want a One Prime Plus newsletter, hemispheric news, only from Martin?
Ooh.
Because I'll do it.
Bonus, bonus. I love that.
I will do a newsletter which people, it'll just be like, oh, what happened to the other two hosts?
Yeah, they're not here anymore. It's just Martin.
So head into the Discord channel for members One Prime Plus and say
yay or nay to just an email from Martin in your inbox every so often.
And not even in a newsletter format it will literally be you'll all be cc'd on the same email
and there'll be no less than 14 different font sizes in the email.
It'll be the foot times.
Forward, forward, forward, forward, forward, forward.
Well we'll see how the format goes that might be a little bit too far for me but yeah.
So, one prime plussians, have your vote, drop a comment in, and we'll see if there'll be the
Feld-only newsletter.
- I would also just caveat that with, if you have other things that you've seen,
you're like, oh, this other show does this interesting thing that I like,
let us know. Like, we're more than welcome for ideas for what people want.
- Oh, I just had an idea. It wasn't my idea. It was something that somebody suggested,
and then we haven't enacted it, but I think we could. And that is a live stream of our
actual recording we got audio hijacked we could pump it a live block do you have audio
hijack and stream out and if people want to listen to the can if they don't it's fine
I'll have to wear a shirt to that no it's audio only it's audio only oh good point yeah
the the video one is is our only fans that'll be up later this month so look forward to
that well the way yeah the way Martin's going this is definitely only fans material yeah
Now, let's finish this off the way we used to finish this off.
We haven't done it in a while.
Okay, here we go.
One prime plus dot com.
It's in the game.
Beautiful.
Man, that brings back the memories.
So you got to change the schedule for how we're recording.
So I'm going to change it now.
Whatever.
Right?
Yeah.
This is just like, he's sitting outside by a fire.
He's got a big machete.
He's just, he's changed, he's a changed man.
So he doesn't care.
Okay.
Do whatever you want.
He says, you know what?
Screw the foot.
I'm not the foot anymore.
Look at that.
Um, we were talking about the show.
I just wanted to quickly touch on reviews, reviews for this show.
That's a thing people can do.
They can review the show.
So I happen to be looking at, uh, the old Apple podcasts, cause that seems to be,
for some reason, the only place people can review podcasts.
But I can only see the US store, which is pretty annoying.
So you really don't have an idea of what your global listeners are looking at.
But anyway, I'm looking at the US store and we had seven reviews for the longest
time and I don't want to brag, but like seven's pretty good.
You know what I'm saying?
Like seven reviews.
Come on.
Totally.
Come on, NPR, step it up to our level.
You know what I'm saying?
So then I look and I say, wait a minute, that number is not seven.
That number is now eight.
What?
Eight reviews in the US.
Of a?
Not app store, whatever it's called.
A podcast place.
iTunes.
iTunes.
And another five stars.
So we are eight for eight, five stars in the US.
Wow.
iTunes, whatever the hell it's called.
So I'm pretty stoked about that.
I would love for it to be like more than eight.
That would be cool.
I think like 80 would be nice.
So feel free to jump in there and five star that thing.
But it made me wonder, what is it in the Australian podcast thingy?
And then I would also further like to ask listeners from wherever you may be that
is not the U S or Australia.
Cause I have access to both of those.
What do we got going on review wise, if anything, in these other stores?
I want to know.
So I'm looking here at the Australian Apple podcasts preview.
Yes. For our show.
OK. And I can see five out of five.
Eight ratings. Mm hmm.
Two reviews.
Two reviews. And one of them looks highly suspicious.
I see three reviews.
So that's interesting.
Wait, you have eight out of eight as well.
Oh no, wait, there are three.
Sorry, it was cropped because of my window.
Yeah, I stand by the fact that one of the reviews is highly suspicious
One of them is that is absolutely true because I thought I could delete it you cannot
Turns out so yeah pretty well looking one of the hosts on this show
Reviewed the show seems fun. I did I was I was testing it and I thought I could remove it
Wait wait wait
So did you Jason did you do the jump JC one no no that's not no I know who that is jump JC
Because I thought that was someone else, but Andrew you've done the AC splinky one right yes
Oh, so Jason. You've done a review on the US in the US store. Oh my god, so you've both like
Influenced yes, yes
So therefore Martin's not criticizing us
It should be us criticizing you because you're the odd man out what for being ethical and transparent
No, what you should have done is when you're in New Zealand, you should have went to the New Zealand store and
Of course, all right, I apologize to both of you I'll head back on the you know soonest Qantas flight, please do
To leave an NZ review. Yeah, but actually this is something I don't think we've done before at least not for ages
I don't think we've ever actually asked for reviews and ratings and it's kind of a
It's been a common thing for people do over time and I'd love
people to review the show and not because I want people to give us a good score or
You know put us up in the charts YouTube probably I mean we don't really care about that not give any
Imagine we would hit any chart. There's no chart
No
But I love the idea if you do have the time to leave a review if you happen to listen with
Apple podcasts or whatever
I would actually just love to see people's honest feedback and the way that people express it is sometimes quite funny or
pithy in that short space
So if you feel like leaving a review just to let us know what you think and maybe you're not as active on
Mastodon or discord or whatever
It'd be much appreciated because I'd be curious. I think that's I think that's part of the issue
We had a funny review on mastodon actually, which I prompted them. They should go put that in the Apple podcast
Review but I think when you look at just what players people are using
Almost none of the people listening to the show are using Apple podcast to begin with so it's sort of just this weird
Disconnective you want to review it or maybe you maybe I'll say maybe you want to review it
But like how do you do that? Because then your steps would be go get this player. That's not great
Resubscribe to a thing you already have in your other player
figure out how to even do a review and then leave.
It's just like it's a it's a big task for people that don't use the player.
Yeah. That's part of my curiosity, though, because we're already within this tech
niche or tech adjacent niche.
And then the people who listen to the show are generally within this overcast slash
Castro's slash podcast.
Other. Yeah. Yeah.
So then there are people out there who are using things like Apple podcasts who maybe we
don't hear from as much. So I'm just curious.
Could be yeah.
I'd be like who are these guys and what I keep you know tuning in every fortnight I could have consumed all these you know find texts or something.
Well if you want to give a review please do we would appreciate it thank you.
And Martin you mentioned as being tech adjacent.
Yes.
So so let's get into some tech adjacency shall we computers in early school.
I believe you dominated this topic.
Now, early school, so for Martin, that was about five years ago.
For me, it was about 30 years ago.
So we've got a little bit of a disconnect, but it'll be interesting to see what comes
out of this.
So talk us through it, Martin.
What computers were you using back in your early days of school?
I'm actually glad this topic came up.
And I think I threw a product in, but then maybe Jason developed it into this.
- Yeah, so what happened was, - Okay, sorry.
- Martin was talking about one of the computers
and it just sort of, and it made me immediately go to like,
what was I using in that timeframe?
Because I'm sure they would be very different.
And then that's sort of where this exploded from, so.
- Yeah, well, I'm glad that you extended it
because when I was thinking about it,
it really clicked in my head this,
why I have a preference or use the things that I do,
because at home, and I think I've covered this
in other conversations,
we were using a Power Macintosh 6500,
I think it was on system eight.
- The Polar Mac, right?
- No, no, no, it was like one of the tower ones,
like the Power Macintosh tower
and it had the extended keyboard and stuff.
And I loved that, and that was normal for me.
I thought this is a computer,
this is quality or the reality of how we use this stuff.
at school, there was a mix of what I think were those kind of either beige or light grey
HP and Dell computers that had something like Windows 98 and then 2000 on them. But then
on the other side of the room were these two or three old school, by that stage, micro
B computers, which were these Australian made computers that were specifically targeted
at education. So we had limited use for those ones. There were some kind of learning apps
on them, but I remember playing, I think it was Micro Space Invaders it was called. There
were like kind of ripoffs and there was like asteroid or asteroids or something.
They just stole the game and put micro in front of it.
Pretty much. Asteroid probably.
Yeah. This is Micro Pac-Man. Okay.
even smaller and harder to track on the screen. So yeah, so the micro bees were kind of fun,
but they were really the niche side thing. The whole experience was through these Windows
computers. And I loved being in there because we used to have very specific computer lessons with
a guy called Mr. Costigan. He was brilliant. Like he was committed as a computer teacher.
And we used to go in there and use things like Corel WordPerfect and learn about proper document
formatting, how to use tables, spreadsheets, navigating intranets and the internet, even
typing tutors. I think I've mentioned before, we've done the typing stuff. We did actual sit
down typing lessons. So that was great. I loved that as a compliment to what was going on at home,
but it really showed me, wow, Windows is crap. So it cemented my view of this is what I have at home
And that's refined. And this is fun and good to learn at school, but I don't like this. Everything
was clunky and wrong in key ways. So, that was my primary school computer experience.
And just to- on the Micro B, you said that was an Australian- that's an Australian brand that was
like- was that like a- I don't want to say clone, but was that one of just another company like
trying to get into the computer game? Or like, what was what was micro B?
Andrew might have more info on this. And I think David H. in Discord suggested a podcast to listen
to about this. And I only got through part of it. So I haven't brought research with me. I don't
want to do that injustice. So we can include that in the show notes. Thanks, David. From what I
understood already, micro B was originally by a company or was originally named Applied Technology
or something and then they rebranded to use that name and it was more something that was in the 80s so by the time that I started school in the late 90s.
They were kind of around but not many of them.
Okay got it I have to say that I looked at it looked at it a little bit and that logo.
That is a good good logo.
It's nice isn't it.
That bee with that orange.
Oh, I love that logo.
Because that was the orange of the screen as well.
So it matched in because it was the text based screen.
Oh, that's even better.
So it's the orange screen.
Amazing.
Nice.
I remember they were nicely made.
Like they were old by the time I got there.
But I remember they had that kind of all in one feeling that Apple kind of became famous for.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
The microbee.
And the micro B was it was that like a tower or was it like kind of one of those all in one
looking sort of deals or?
It was all in one I think. I don't think it had like a pizza box bottom did it?
It was it did sit on something or it came out I think.
So like the monitor kind of sat on top of the CPU piece.
Like an Apple 2 looking kind of thing?
I think so.
Okay.
Yeah. It's a long time ago.
Yeah. So it was kind of like a little like the keyboard came out of the screen
set on top of it. So it had that kind of two-ish look to it.
Got it. Okay. Yeah. I remember correctly.
I think transition transition to Andrew then. Cause I mean, it sounds like,
I think micro B was probably part of your...
So I was struggling with this really struggling to remember cause it was so long
ago. So long ago. And I think I may be...
How do we even count that high?
Maybe I actually predated computers.
Maybe I don't have a memory of computers cause they were no such things in the
school that was so rare.
Abacus only.
Yeah.
I do remember my first touch typing lessons were on a mechanical typewriter and hitting the A key was very difficult because of the power needed on the pinky to really slam that A down to get the, you know, the key to pop forward.
So I'm that old.
And also I had a nice school, didn't have a lot of money, so I don't think they were flashing around buying new computers.
Yeah.
Did you have ink wells?
We did use our fountain pens when we got to year 7.
So that was something.
So you didn't have quills.
You didn't have a quill.
No, I didn't have quill.
I didn't have quills.
And didn't have chalkboards, personal chalkboards.
Hedwig didn't come flying through the window recess or something.
No.
So I think we did have some microbeads, but the more I think about it,
Because it yeah, yeah, I think there's a couple but I don't have great memories
I remember my sister talking about him
She went to a different school and I feel like she had the micro be experience more strongly than I did
So I think maybe it might have just been an IBM XT
kind of deal
you know, you know just the
DOS based approach to those computers and
What I have memories of is I have memories of crappy crappy apps and and hating school computing because it was so
Fundamentally boring the one I remember being most boring was turtle Oh
Turtle yes, it's like oh mate and and it wasn't like I think now I think turtle is still around
But it's actually robots that drive around on the floor these days
Something like that, but you know in like back when we were doing it was it was just a plot on a screen
And I was like wow I can make this little graphic go up to right to big effing deal so boring
Turtle graphics right yeah, yeah, it was it was it called turtle graphing so we just used to call it turtle
Used to call yeah, he's crap
And you he would like you draw a triangle or like yeah, yeah, okay boring
And then like use a lot of print master
Making signs did some programming to turbo Pascal
That was the programming language of choice, and if you want to know more about all this
I've suddenly realized that I've talked to Martin about this before on lounge ruminator episode
028 or I talk about my my origin story of computers, so I feel like I'm so there we go entering into ground
That's already been covered
Check out that episode lounge ruminator episode 28. I believe it's called a potted computer history
- Yeah, and I'm glad you brought this up
because you actually shared that with someone
on micro.blog recently, who I think joined the network.
And then they mentioned to me that you suggested it
and I went, "Oh, I remember doing that.
I'm gonna go and check it out."
So I didn't really listen to the whole thing
because I didn't have time,
but I stuck on the first five or 10 minutes
and it was actually oddly nostalgic
because if no one's listened to it, this is actually,
no, seriously, this is just back in 2020, I think.
So it's not a long time.
But given everything that's happened,
the whole pandemic, our recording,
the way this podcast has gone on,
different side projects,
friendship through micro.blog,
all these other people who listen,
Discord goes on and on.
It's like, this is the conversation
before we actually knew each other properly.
And I recall it was the episode
that Jason kind of jumped on the bandwagon
with "Let's do something."
And then we had our pilot.
So if it hadn't have been for that episode, we wouldn't have this show.
That's that's why the origin story.
It was weird. Wow.
It was weird to actually listen to it and go, oh, how's it going, Andrew?
No worries, Martin. I don't yet know that you're a foot.
Nice to meet you.
At least you'll wear your shirt.
The foot will reveal itself.
Yeah. I've let myself go since then.
Two years later and he's not bothering with his shirt.
Two years later, no shirt.
Just can't be bothered.
Whatever. And can I say another thing?
You said Turbo Pascal, right?
Yeah. I'm glad you said Pascal.
And you actually in the notes have put it underneath Printmaster, right?
Which, as you've written, I assume correctly for the brand, has a capital P and a capital E.
I believe so. Yes. I might be wrong.
Now, I just wanted to mention what I thought.
No, no, no. What I...
It doesn't matter to me whether you're right or wrong.
It's just the way that you've written it reminded me.
Like you two, and I think some of our listeners have gathered that I like things to be correct.
Right? Yes.
I mean, you've got that vibe.
Yeah a little prior to today yes I don't know about going forward will say.
Your last episode changed me the living expenses to influential but.
It reminded me I was listening to ABC radio in the car the local or station I think on the way home from work and they were having a discussion and someone said oh did the the the.
This thing is in camel case and you know what camel case is we have a capital letter in the middle of a word and the person said.
Well, actually, and I thought this was correcting even beyond my standards or, you know, I was like, wow, this is in your face. They said, I believe you'll actually find that Pascal case because Pascal case is capital at the front or an earlier capital with another capital there.
Whereas what you're talking about is the camel where it's just and I was like wow and the fact that you've put the word
Pascal after
Pascal case as an example within our show notes. I couldn't resist mentioning that
If you're gonna well actually somebody on Pascal case
But I loved it, but they're like, oh, thanks I've learned something it wasn't an aggressive thing
It was just well, let's clear this up for the listeners on ABC radio that there's a difference between Pascal and Kevin Martin
Here's that he's like this guy's
Well, like maybe save it up like for off
Off-air or something. I thought it was great
And it's amazing I love it
Okay, okay. Hmm. Well, that's Jason's turn I think
yeah, I my
Past memory is is not a surprise. I don't fully remember
So I had to sort of start looking at Wikipedia a little bit to see where the dates lined up
I very much remembered it being
well
The first computer in school that I remember using I'll say that there very well could have been something before that
Don't remember it. So did it really happen? We don't know
But the very first one was an Apple computer
I very distinctly remember that playing games, doing typing tests, doing those kinds of things.
And so I immediately thought it was an Apple II.
But looking at the timeline of the Apple II, there's two things that could have happened
here.
Either we never upgraded our computers, so we were using super old Apple IIs, probably
likely, given that computers of that time were like, "We don't need to spend money on
computers are dumb, right? Like everybody thought computers were stupid. So that's probably what
happened. Or it was what do I have here an Apple IIe, which was a later model of the Apple II.
So either one, it could have been, I'm not sure. No one will ever know. But it was definitely an
Apple II-ish kind of thing. And I just remember that being like my favorite part of the day,
every week of going to computer class and getting through the boring typing stuff.
Wasn't super into that, obviously, where they'd put like a shoe box over your hand.
Yeah, we had the t-tails.
Yeah. So we did like, there was, you had to bring a shoe box that was cut out on one side
to stick over the keyboard so you couldn't see your hands. But then after you finished your
lessons you got free time to do whatever you wanted.
So you'd bang through all of your typing stuff to get it done as soon as possible so you
could play Oregon Trail.
Like that was it.
It was all about Oregon Trail and getting to the point where you could do the hunting
because that was like the skill part.
You had to be really good at getting that thing to angle right and understand how the
bullets were going to go to like hit the little deer or whatever.
that was the skill part and that was where like if you were good at the hunting part like you were
good at Oregon Trail. You may have like a broken leg dysentery, your wagon is complete shit,
but if you could hunt like you were the guy for sure. So I remember that very fondly.
Jason, I have a question for you. Yeah.
I'm starting to wonder if this time in your life was so influential that
your life leading up to your more recent move has just been one big Oregon Trail.
It's absolutely true. Yes, it very much could be why I live in Oregon now. It's quite possible.
Do you have dysentery?
I mean, I haven't checked lately, but it's possible. I don't know. I feel okay today.
I feel pretty good. Yeah.
Very good.
But quickly, just back, I don't want to drag this topic on forever, but
I think Martin, you mentioned your computer teacher being like, really, like just, you know,
Dedicated.
Dedicated and like into it. Yeah. And that is something I've always remembered is there have
been some of my favorite teachers, I would say most of them really were in the computer realm
in some way. And like always, they just got you in a way that other teachers didn't get you.
Okay.
Because you were that kind of kid. You were like into technology, it was still pretty new.
but they knew that like, this is what excited you.
It wasn't math, it wasn't, you know,
math and science were fine, like you liked them,
that was okay, history, whatever.
But like, when you got into computer class,
like you were fully attentive,
you wanted to be there the whole day.
And I just, I have so many memories
of various computer teachers from early on
up through high school of just them going the extra mile
not even going the extra mile or kilometer,
going the extra 10 miles, 20 miles,
like just doing whatever it took
to get you what you needed in that class.
It's just, it's an interesting, when you connect,
yeah, I feel like art people probably have that
with like art teachers and various other types
of disciplines, but for me, computers was definitely it.
And like in high school, I remember like one
my early high school jobs was with my computer teacher
like running Cat5 through people's houses
to like, you know, like as a side business.
That was the thing that we would do.
- Andrew was doing that as part
of his vocational mechanics course,
repairing cars, if you recall.
- Yes, exactly.
Cat5 car repair, exactly.
And that probably came from his computer teacher
'cause that's what their car probably looked like.
And he's like, I get it.
- Look back in the One Prime Plus archive,
anyone who's confused.
- Bluebird, baby.
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah, but I agree with you.
And I think the best teachers then and these days realize,
and I don't wanna get too academic here,
but this reminds me of something that I read
by a media ecologist called Neil Postman.
He said that, and this is decades ago,
he was writing this in the '70s,
that it's not enough just to teach English
or maths or whatever.
People have to be taught in the context of technology,
whether it's a pen or a table or a computer
or any other kind of tool,
everything is being transmitted and consumed
through technology or media.
They're synonymous in this discipline, right?
If you had a decent computer teacher,
they were teaching technology in context.
You would have been learning how to navigate documents
or websites or do formulas or whatever.
It's not just a tool for the sake of the tool.
It's integrated into learning.
And I say this with Natasha all the time.
It's different these days where when I was being taught
by Mr. Costigan and the computer was more
of a specialist tool in a room,
at least that's how it was viewed.
These days, people like Natasha are managing fleets
of iPads that have to be in the room
and we're saturated by it.
So where I think maybe people were dismissive
in the early days 'cause it was like,
oh, that's a niche tool.
Now people are dismissive because it's like,
oh, everyone has a phone, kids are digital natives,
quote unquote, they'll learn it.
So it's kind of apathy or laziness from a lot of people
when you should be, this should be the core of stuff.
And I think you got that enthusiasm
when you were at school, Jason,
because that teacher understood
this is something that engages kids
and they can learn with effectively if it's taught properly.
- Yeah, and it wasn't about right or wrong.
That was the one thing
that was always at the core of everything.
So one, just quick example.
I remember being in a class where we were doing,
I think it was Visual Basic Programming,
if I remember right.
Which I'm sure everybody remembers Visual Basic.
But the whole class became,
every student eventually started figuring out
how to use the programming language to, in effect,
attack a different classmate's computer
through the network.
And so it became this little arms race
of like who could kind of get into the other person's machine
and like do things via Visual Basic.
And like eventually the teacher was like,
obviously knows what's going on.
But instead of being like, no, you're doing it,
you're not following the lesson, like you're doing it wrong.
They just flipped the whole thing and were like,
no, this is now what the lesson is.
Like, let's figure out a way to turn this
into like a learning experience
of like not only attack, but defense.
So it kind of became this like security thing,
which was just like, no one,
everybody expected that we were gonna get in trouble
and they were gonna shut it down and we'd be like done.
But the fact that they could see what was happening
and how we loved what was happening,
but then turned it back into learning,
was just like, that makes so much more sense
than trying to just say, no, you must be in this stupid box
because that's what the curriculum states.
Like, yeah, that was just,
that was really, really great for me.
And I think just an inspirational thing to say like,
hey, everything's not just right or wrong,
like there's different perspectives on things.
So like, let's figure out a way
to use this as a learning opportunity.
- So to use the cringeworthy term
that governments and news media like to employ,
you and your generation
are actually the origin of cybercrime.
You were taught at school to engage in cybercrime.
- Yeah, I guess so.
(laughs)
- It's white hat hacking.
- It worked out all right.
- Oh, hackers, there's a good word.
I love that on the news
whenever they say hacking and cybercrime
And suddenly matrix code takes over someone with a hoodie is like hunched over like
Don't forget the anonymous mask.
You gotta have the anonymous mask on too.
Cause if you don't have that, you're not really hacking.
It wouldn't really, we know they're just some person eating Cheetos at home or
something.
Cause you're trying to see if computer screens, you want to put a mask on,
obviously.
So they don't see you.
Martin, you were talking about computers as, as a niche tool, right?
Yeah. Back in the day, maybe.
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, I've got another niche tool.
Oh, what is that segue I hear a segue my friend is a met my driver and this came from this is screwdriver corner we have now entered screwdriver.
I see what you've done this is screwdriver corner well done love screwdriver what the hell is that this thing I ordered this off a kickstarter campaign gosh probably more than a year ago.
It was definitely over a year ago right had to have been maybe close to two years ago and like all Kickstarter stories you have this is a cycle of hope.
Despair disappointment.
And supply chain.
Fun fact no one actually knows how to do building of things at scale.
No, no and this thing was backed ridiculously they got millions of dollars worth of backing for a screwdriver.
But it's ratcheted so it's like a socket set screwdriver if you could imagine those two things combined and it's glorious it arrived so they,
It seemed like it was never gonna happen. They had all their production issues, you know, making it didn't quite work out the way they thought it was gonna go. They had to try again all those typical things, but eventually mine arrived and I was very excited.
And it's completely over engineered. I don't I'm not a handyman. What am I gonna do with this? I've got a screwdriver. Why don't I need this thing? But it's amazing. And it's got this handle. It's a bit like reminds me of a mechanical play date.
Because you can put out the little crank which gives you a talk.
You can put talk on it so you can hold it and turn that and really get some power into your screwdriver.
So what are you screwing day to day Andrew.
What's funny you should ask so the day after it arrived I had to take cover off my hot water system.
And that had four screwdrivers, four screws that I was able to drive out with this baby when I was looking at the hot water system.
And then I looked at it and realized I didn't know what I was looking at and I screwed the cover back on.
See, my brother-in-law knows how to install and fix hot water systems, so it's a shame you don't live in Wollongong.
We could have held you.
Shame he doesn't live in Perth.
Well, shoot, my driver is all well and good, right?
And I was I just had to sit on my desk.
And then I saw Jason Burke, co-host of Hemispheric Views, put something on one of his many websites
somewhere saying, "Oh, look what I just arrived. This thing, look what just arrived. This thing is
amazing. It's my Metmo driver." And I was like, "Come on." We had not talked about this at all.
But it just goes to show why we are co-hosts of this show, because we are basically the same person
in different hemispheres. He obviously had the same idea, saw the project, bought it,
and he's arrived at a very similar time. So both of us are Metmo driver nerds.
Yeah, I love it. It's a really, really nice tool overall. It did take forever to get here. It's a
classic Kickstarter story, just like Andrew said. You order it or you back it rather. It's generally
less than a 10% chance that anything you back is gonna actually happen, and it's less than
1% that it will hit any kind of timeline that they say.
But as long as you go into it understanding that and being like, "Whatever, if it shows
up great, if not, fine."
But this one is one of the rare ones that really met expectations.
The build quality is exceptional, everything about what they promise to deliver is there,
And it's a really high quality tool that I've used for like actual building and it works
great.
So it's kind of the unicorn Kickstarter story of somebody said they were going to deliver
something and they actually delivered it.
I don't know if you can even get these now after the fact, but I haven't looked so far.
Super thrilled with it and I really, really like it.
But it was very comical that you're like, I got one of these too.
Like what?
There's no way I had no clue that you had ordered this thing seemingly two years ago at the same time I did.
Who I think would really enjoy this and I think he actually commented on the discord and I think he was a bit dismissive which hurt my feelings a little bit.
Was that was David H in our discord.
He is the ultimate.
Because he actually builds stuff out of wood.
He's the ultimate handyman right yeah.
If I brought this to him though, so let's, okay, I'm going to drive up to Seattle. I'm going to
bring this with me and I'm going to show it to him and he's going to be like, okay, yes,
this is actually pretty great. Once he sees it and uses it, he's going to love it. And especially
when I show him the patent that this is based on from like 1858 or whatever.
Yeah, when he was a child.
He's going to, yeah, he's exactly, he's going to love it.
Don't insult our listeners.
Would that have been metmo and sun or met that would have been into like body tonics back then right for vitality
Yeah, it's the same device. It was just made of like uranium. Yes. Yeah, because that was good
And then you'd have every young child needs a dose of uranium and then you'd have a a can of cocaine
You know with that's just to take the edge off. Yeah, but it's really amazing. So david h this is not a pregnant leatherman
Okay, it is it's not it's really good. I really it's a fine screwdriver
I've used it twice in the last two days.
- And it takes standard bits.
You can just drop in standard bits.
- I'm just super impressed, Andrew,
that you actually used it on something
like a hot water system,
because the way you were playing with it, right?
On this call we're having right now.
I thought this is something that Andrew requested
three years ago through Kickstarter
to be like a fidget cube.
- Well, it could function well as that, actually,
'cause it's got all these clicky bits.
- That's what I mean, you were kind of like,
oh, it's satisfying and it's clicking
and it's turning and it's great.
And I'm like, is it gonna screw anything?
Now the one thing I have to declare is I'm clearly not a handyman and when it first arrived I didn't quite understand how it worked and I did go looking for instructions.
And then I had to reset myself and say Andrew it's a screwdriver lefty loosey righty tighty that's all you need to know.
Yeah.
Go from there.
That's it.
Like I'm a man I know how to use a screwdriver I don't need instructions.
Yeah.
You can do the left handed screwdriver thing.
That screwdriver corner.
What song you enjoying the most of the moment you're trying to make me sing again I.
I have to try anything I have to try I'll just sing without prompt well.
Top of the canyon charts what's going on right now it's funny you should mention that.
Have we mentioned there's two things here we we've already promoted Voyager and Eurovision again haven't we I lose track about whether I've promoted.
Not on the show but we but in the in the thing.
Okay so what.
Well congrats to Alex formally on the show I don't know if we have and I need to mention he is the composer the original composer of the really specific stories theme if you need evidence of quality go check out his handy work on that.
And he's got one of these on the mayonnaise.
Yeah, his mayonnaise base.
The stickers.
And he did the Media Corner music as well.
So.
That's right.
He is everywhere.
And he's, so yeah, he's got his band is going to Voyager, the proper Voyager.
I mean, not, yeah, yeah.
His band Voyager is going to Eurovision.
That's what I'm trying to say.
Yeah.
Voyager is taking, they're making the voyage to Eurovision.
I think.
To Eurovision.
That is not the song that you're asking me about.
So the song that's the top of my head at the moment is my little son Benjamin is entered his Teen Titans phase
Okay, has anybody ever watched Teen Titans? I have not okay
There are two songs in Teen Titans that are
absolutely
Incredible and because I'm hearing them all again
It is I'm just buying for time because I'm trying to find the song here. Hang on one second. It's okay
Just look at Martin naked in the window. It's fine. I've got probably I can stand up if you want. Yeah
Yeah, I'd love to see what's down below. So oh, come on Center stage. You're ruining it
Okay, so so the two songs of Teen Titans the first the first one is there's a little bit and they keep bringing Santa
And they say here comes the jolly fat man
Right, so is that he's the jolly fat man
Yeah and then the other one the real good one best episode teen Titans ever is when cyborg.
Talks about his favourite song from the 80s and it's when the night begins to shine.
I see the shadows in your eyes I can't remember quite lyrics I've just I can sing it when you sing it but I need I need him to be singing along I need share play singing.
Sorry what I'm saying. I really like that. Can you sing another 80s track in that voice? Can you do some Huey Lewis?
I would love to hear Andrew doing Huey Lewis actually. I don't like Huey Lewis. Shut. Oh
Jason just gave like evil eye.
This show is over. Okay. How do you feel Andrew? How do you feel about the Huey Lewis and Gwyneth Paltrow duet Cruisin?
I like that actually.
So he likes that
So I think I you dance from the corner caught
Your seat is reading the letter
in a conversation
playing hard to get
but I can't understand when I look at you I
See the story in your eyes
When we're dancing
Night begins to shine.
Night begins to shine night begins to shine.
Come on guys night begins to shine.
What's gonna ask if you like scratched and like on repeat do we have to save you at that point.
It sounds like the needles skipping.
My heart was racing.
I got you don't have the music going.
I don't see how long would go for I thought it was just gonna keep going for like 45 minutes Andrew has been set to party shuffle.
Andrew play 80s music I see the story in your eyes.
Andrews broken when we're dancing the night begins to shine.
Okay begins to shine so yeah my being in the shower and in three hours my mouse doing that thing is going over my iPad.
I promised I wouldn't do that I promised I wouldn't sing.
(upbeat music)
(upbeat music)
