We wrap back around to see how Andrew's experience with the Apple Watch Series 6 has been, and talk about how great the iPhone mini from the latest Apple event is going to be. Thoughts follow on HomePod and what we use for home theatre setups. Then there's the first of a new recurring section, Media Corner! We pick a movie, book, and album for you to check out. Finally, is Halloween a thing in Australia?
