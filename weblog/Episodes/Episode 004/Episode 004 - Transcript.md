Man I wish I had that fat head.
It's just going to be like a perpetual thing, right?
You're going to order something after every single one and then there'll always be something
like trailing for the next one.
This podcasting caper is expensive, isn't it?
Except for Martin.
But you know what's great?
We're going to hear each episode go past and you're going to be evolutionary.
You're just going to be getting better and better and I'm going to be wallowing in my
own crappulence in the same state for episodes to come.
They'll be going "Wow, that Martin's cheap."
You're the benchmark, you know?
You'll be like "Do we actually get better or is it just throwing money away?"
Probably the latter.
You're the control. You're the control. That's what I should call you.
I think there's a place where people can tell that now. What would that be?
If they have feedback for us.
Yeah, we have a Discord server all of our own, don't we?
That's what everyone is doing these days, right?
You can join the chat right now. You can type live while we record.
We're not streaming this live, so I'm not sure how that'll work, but you could join in and type stuff.
So what do you need the Fethead for if, I mean, it sounds... I think it sounds fine.
Or is this just like, are you maxed out at this point?
Yeah, so my gain is set at about 95% and I just worry that...
Well, I feel sorry for the little box, to be perfectly honest.
I think it shouldn't have to work that hard.
Okay, that's fair.
So for the listeners at home and ignoramuses like me, can you explain what the word that sounds like fathead means?
Yes, well, all right. I am using now a Rode
Procaster microphone I've upgraded from the Rode
Podcaster microphone last week. I was actually using the Audio Technica ATR 2100X as a stand-in
This one's much easier to say
So a fethead is something along the lines of a cloud lifter
basically you plug it in between your microphone and your
Audio interface and it prove and you provide it with phantom power, which is like the coolest term ever
Phantom power. No, that's just awesome. You don't have to know what it is, but you know, you want it
I'm thinking of the guy who dresses in purple. It's Billy Zane, right? He comes with the whole product
Yep, he comes running in the room with a little cord and says what do you need?
And it's not just phantom powers
48 volts of phantom power which sounds even sexier
So yeah, so you plug that in and then because this little device just like a little bullet basically plugs in between your devices
And then you can turn the game down to about probably
40 or 50 percent so it gives you more
Yeah, you're not driving everything as hard is the theoretical now whether that actually matters
I don't know I've watched a lot of YouTube videos. I've gone way too deep and overboard
But I figured I've gone this far into it. I have to see it through to the end
Yeah, it's the point of no return now
Yeah
Are either of you golfers by any chance?
used to be
used to be
Because I'm feeling this whole audio journey that you're going on is very much like the rabbit hole that you fall down when you get
A golf set a buggy. Oh wait
I need this and then the Fethead sort of like that little extra club that does that thing that's a little bit between the fairway
in the bunker but you're not quite sure and then suddenly you've got to get the covers
on it, oh no but those wheels aren't as good as these wheels so I've got to get that from
my buggy and it just goes on.
Do you feel like you're in that vortex at the moment?
Yes.
That's 100% accurate.
You're effectively buying things to fill the gap of your inadequacies that actually aren't
there but you feel like they're there.
It's probably cheaper than golf though, to be fair.
And I think that I'm already better at podcasting than I ever was at golf.
You don't need a whole bag full of microphones, you really only need one, technically.
I mean, I can't speak for everyone, but usually you just need one.
I'm moving towards a half set at the moment.
And no one's dropping their microphones in sand or water, so that's a plus.
Andrew, do you have something to report about some products that you purchased?
I went shopping.
You remember we had an Apple event.
Not the most recent Apple event, but the one prior to that where we got a new Apple Watch.
Which is weird, right?
It's been two weeks since we recorded and we're already having to say, "Not the most
recent Apple event, but the one before it."
That never happened before.
It used to just be there'd be one and you knew exactly what you were talking about.
I bought the new Apple Watch.
So I was moving up from a Series 1 to a Series 6.
Oh my goodness, guys.
This is an epic upgrade.
Absolutely zero regrets about it.
It's kind of like what I hoped the Series 1 was going to be when I bought it all that
time ago.
It's like it has now become sort of the thing.
Absolutely loving it.
The always-on display is excellent.
I know some people complain about the dimming and the loss of animation and all that, but
I don't care.
I can just look at it and see the time, right?
which is kind of good because I do a lot of client meetings and there's nothing more rude than sort of having to
Shake your wrist around and look and tap and even if you're not trying to be rude
It is perceived as such you don't even have to be looking at the time though
That's the worst part is it could be a total it could be a notification about
You know an emergency or something
Yeah
Just you're checking and it just naturally because it looks like it's a watch that you're just checking the time
Yeah, and you always had to do this overly exaggerated
Arm-lift that made it look like you were really trying to rub in the fact that hey, I'm looking at my watch now
Why don't you wrap it up and you're it's like no, I just I had a message
I just wanted to make sure it was nothing important
Yeah, just throw in a little twiddle of the digital crown there just to justify that extra time
They're like he must be doing something really important and scrolly on that device
Yeah, cuz if you look at your phone people just think you're rude, which yeah, okay, that's fine
Yeah, but if it's a watch it's like oh I'm wasting mr. Big times time over here. Oh, sorry
It's like John's money man. Yeah, exactly
So that I totally agree because that was definitely a stigma in in meetings from like Apple watch zero to five
I guess how's your blood oxygen? It's looking good good 98% Generally. I got it to 100 once
I guess that's even better, right? Do you know what it's supposed to be? Cuz I have no idea. Yeah, okay
No, I think 96 plus doesn't 100 just mean that you're pure oxygen
That seems dangerous your to baby
I don't know if you're familiar with Carl Pilkington from the Ricky Gervais show
But he always said jellyfish are pointless because if they're 98% water just add 2% and you've just got water
So you're just essentially pure oxygen at this rate
Pretty much
the other thing I can attest to is
If you're at the gym and you're doing a plank and you have to plank for like 45 seconds or something
Much easier to quickly glance at your watch with the noise on counter trying to get you through your seconds rather than trying to like
Get your nose and tap your watch with the nose or something to wake it up to see if you survived you 45 seconds
Yeah, that's a big seller
I can see why Apple Fitness has become more of a thing because you can actually see your counts
The Apple watch nose move is always been one of the most embarrassing things
But I totally did it all the time the haptic crown Martin
You said that the haptic crown if it didn't have a haptic crown it felt broken
Okay, I understand what you're talking about now having not had one before and having one now it just seems right
I was surprised when you actually said that because I guess I just don't remember but I thought it was always
There since the very beginning because it feels so natural, but then I looked back and yeah sure enough
It was it it'd be like having an iPod that didn't make the clicking sound when you scrolled on it
Yeah, which was the original with the physical scrolly wheel, but people forget that it's like
Oh, yeah, it just does that
Thing that was a great feeling by the way that thing felt so good. Yeah, so and then I've been using the sleep tracking
I've been sleeping with it to sort of see how little sleep I'm getting
I'm clearly I'm about an hour and a half short every night of what I should be getting
The only thing I would say I'm not loving or I haven't got right yet is a watch face. I
Still feel like I want an analog display
But I still can't pass the analog display as quickly and as accurately as just as well as like a real
watch
So a lot of the time I still end up being on a digital display
Just because I can read it better
But and I know how to read an analog watch, but it just I don't know
There's something about the way it works that just my eyes don't
Interpret the time and I've tried all sorts of settings and different faces. I just can't quite get it, right
So what do you want now?
GMT one that one offers you an analog time, but then also just shows me what it is in Portland
Which is helpful for this today so I can tell you it's 6 a.m. In Portland
Usually I'm using like it one is it the digital modular just the classic, you know
Three icons down the bottom and something in the middle and the time
It's amazing how personal and different this can be because I can tell you the only face that I truly love and enjoy using is
the entirely blank
Simple face with the minute second and hour hand and the date
Completely blank with no complications
Essentially what I love about it is when you look at the edge of the OLED screen you have no concept of where it ends
It's just this plain face and then I use the dock to get to the most used app so I can imagine that sounds completely
barbaric to a lot of other Apple watch users who like to tap directly on complications, but I love looking down seeing a watch and
That's it the number of times I'd go. Oh, that's the temperature. Wait, what's the time? It just distracted me
It just annoyed me. That is very interesting
I try to set mine up to where I have to interact with it as little as possible
If I never have to touch it, I'm very happy. Yeah, so I use the I think it's
Infograph
Modular or something like that. It's got three on the bottom
Kind of a bigger one in the middle one in the upper left and then the time and the date in the upper, right?
Yeah, it usually works. I think I have a couple of different ones of those set up for different times of the day
But other than that, yeah, I I liked and and it's not because I don't want to interact with it
It's just like if I don't have to that I don't want to but it's interesting how each of the three of us
Have a completely different reason for why we like yeah each of those faces
Yeah, for sure. How do you do your workflow for the sleep thing?
I never really got that figured out in terms of you know, having things charged enough
And I mean it's easier now being home obviously because it's like oh crap. I'll just go throw it on the charger
But previously I used to use two different watches. I'd use like my old watch for night. I hate that. It's awful
It's a terrible solution. But do you find that it works? Okay, just kind of
Trickle charging it here and there or what's your what's your strategy? Yeah, that's that's pretty much what I'm doing
So it'll be evening time I get you know, sort of between
Six and eight o'clock probably, you know
I'm dealing with kids and all that
Might be having a shower or anything like that and I'll put it on the charger at that point and just let it juice up
It doesn't take very long and then I'll put it on again it yeah after that and wear it to bed
In the morning time I may just chuck it on the charger again
You know while I'm getting breakfast ready and those sorts of things and then put it on when I'm starting the day
So it's sort of like two two mini charges
Yeah, I would always forget it on the charger and then it would be like hours later like ah, damn it
It's charged but now I've missed like all of my
Circles. Yeah, actually have you ever left the house? Well, let me put it this way
I can't not have my watch on that. It's just weird
Have you ever left the house without your watch on and if you have did you say I have to go back home and get it?
Did you just suffer through the day or did you go to the store and buy a new watch just so you could have a watch?
That's the Jason Burke approach right there
What did you do and have you ever done that?
I have forgotten it and felt weird
But not bothered to go back and get one and certainly have I've got a serious one to a series six
So no, I haven't bought one. Although maybe I'd be tempted to buy one of those little Casio jobs from the chemist
I've done that once and I drove back to get it because I realized as I was driving I couldn't handle it
But Natasha's told me a bunch of times that she's been at school. I've got the message from her at work going
Oh, no, it's at home. I'm lost what's going on?
And I just think well your day's ruined and I've offered to go to bring it. She's no no, no, it's fine
I just needed to let you know what you've done to me as
this
Mac infiltrator now, I can't live without this thing amazing one other thing I'll say as well
I've answered phone calls on this thing and it works
Mm-hmm. I tried doing that with my old one and it never quite felt like it was working properly this one fine
Yeah, and I think the other person at the other end is hearing me. I assume so
Yeah, it's a real dick Tracy kind of thing. So what else did you get? I got the air pods air pods Pro
I went to the extra effort of getting engraved because I never do engraving and I thought why not get an engraving
Did you get letters or emoji? I'm such a nerd. I
Am didn't really know what to put on it, but I knew I wanted something so I put my domain name
Well, if you lose them andra canyon calm if anybody finds it on the street, okay
Can you hand them in?
It's like when you're a kid and you put your home phone number on all your stuff because
you like are really excited that you have a home phone number.
No one's going to call you, but you put your phone number on there just in case.
But overall, I got to say AirPods Pro, not quite as happy as the watch.
I've got some, I've got some issues.
Wow.
That's very surprising because I've had nothing but absolute delight with AirPods Pro.
at home I have my surprise face on keep going in well look I don't know if it's
something I can really blame out before I think it might be my own genetic
makeup I don't think my ears are very well shaped ah okay so it's not so much
the air pods themselves it's just a fit issue yeah I've changed the tips so I
started came with a medium tip I I did the little tip tester thingy me Bob and
and they were feeling like they weren't going in properly so I went to the
smaller ones and they, I feel like I'm jamming it in further in my ears now,
which I think is a good thing, but I'm also having to pivot them.
So, you know, normally you'd have the little dangly bit and it sort of
dangles down along your jawline almost, you know, I'm almost feeling like
at least with one of them, and this is where I think it's me, not Apple.
I kind of have to twist it.
So it's almost a pointing out, like if it was a laser gun, it
would shoot somebody in the eye.
And then I find when I talk, they kind of just gradually shuffle out of my ear canal and you lose that seal.
So I'm constantly having to sort of push it back in.
But then for the first few days when I was doing that, a couple of times I was on calls, I'm so used to with the old ones, grabbing the stalk and repositioning it.
Don't grab the stalk on the AirPods Pro because you're going to push the button and you're going to cancel the call.
You got to kind of push it on its little end bit.
Yeah, you kind of have to do like a like a pinch top to bottom.
Yeah, OK. Yeah, right.
I find them more uncomfortable.
I wear them for a little while.
I'm like, these are hurting my ears now, and I never had that with my old ones.
That is the saddest thing I've ever heard.
Have you considered any of those foam ones that you can order online?
The ones that are compatible, which it's almost like memory foam,
like a mattress for your ear.
Oh, OK. I hadn't looked into that at all.
There are alternatives that you could probably try
if you're not a fan of the little cup ones.
Okay, I'm gonna let that one rest for a couple of weeks because I think we may have some
traction on these over the coming weeks as you use them a little more. I think. I'm hoping.
Maybe not, but I hope so. I'll monitor and report back.
But now we have another Apple event that just happened. So this was a big, big, big...
This is the one we've been waiting for. What are we doing? That's the question. Well,
It's a big event, but it's a small event in the sense that the only thing that matters is the iPhone mini
But I will let you give your answers before I completely hijack about iPhone mini
Okay, so I did not buy anything
I was very impressed with what was released in terms of iPhone mini
Like you said Jason obviously every year Apple impresses with what they can cram into an iPhone whether it's the camera upgrades
screen whatever this time they went smaller which to me even though I'm not buying it this year is a relief because
Whether it was the SE or even just things like the iPhone 7 or 8 just having something that has that thumb reach ability
I was a little bit concerned
They were gonna be dropping that for a while because Apple's best phones in my opinion have always been their smaller ones
They didn't have to have something the size of like a food platter
I won't go too far into the products because I think maybe you'll do that Jason
but something that I sort of observed about the event and also WWDC,
and I wrote a little bit about this on my blog in an assessment of how the keynotes go.
Even though they're very visually impressive, and I think they do a great job with the transitions,
the shots of Apple Park, the segues, all of this stuff, I'm a little bit concerned that
if they continue this virtual video trend post-COVID, you sort of lose the novelty a little bit.
I feel like having things spread out a bit does enable Apple to extend its marketing message.
It can cover more of the tech news and surprise and delight and all of those great things, but
it starts to feel like a bit of an infomercial. And particularly without the audience present.
I mean, you've got scripted statements on stage anyway, whether it's Federighi or Schiller or
whoever, but without those little moments of interaction with the crowd or actual face-to-face
stuff, I sat there through a chunk of this event feeling a little bit bored.
How's Verizon 5G gonna work out for you in Wollongong?
That's what I mean, right?
And I sat there thinking, why is there a very charming and humorous German man
leading an American company talking to me in Australia about a network that I can't have?
It was just a bit bizarre.
So I had sort of mixed feelings about the presentation.
Does that make sense?
Yeah, absolutely.
I mean, and by the way, this episode is brought to you by 5G.
The thing that everyone seems to care about, but they don't know why.
I would agree with that.
I think the problem is there's just for a number of reasons, I'm sure that we've had
this many events in such a short time.
I can't imagine that's now the norm.
I think maybe the video thing will be the norm, but I can't imagine it's going to be
every month there's going to be an event because you're totally right.
At some point, you're just going to tune out and no one cares anymore.
You can't keep banging that drum over and over and over.
And that's something if anyone knows, they know better than most companies is that they
want to have a message when they want to have a message, not just because
something happened, I think fortunately, because this was the iPhone event, you
know, it didn't really matter that it was a month later because people were going
to be watching it and excited about it no matter what.
But I agree that you do kind of lose a little bit of the.
It's like the it's, I just wrote about that zoom thing the other day.
It's kind of like that where everything, when it's just a video format and it's
exactly the same every time, you start to just fall into this mid-zone of like,
"I'm excited but I don't really know why, but I'm here to watch, but again it's I
don't know why." So it's a Pavlovian response. Yeah, exactly. It just it becomes
just something you have to do rather than something you want to do. So I think
that'll go away. I don't think we're gonna have, I mean, well I shouldn't say
that. I think we probably will have yet another event just because there's so
much crap that needs to be released this year that's behind. But I think going
into next year it probably will be different. That being said, the products that were announced
I thought were great. I was a little bit, uh, not hesitant but just standing on the edge of
or sitting on the edge of my seat a little bit going into what these iPhones were going to be.
I think mostly just because as a very long time iPhone user not much has changed in which is a
terrible thing to say but in the sense of buying iPhones you really would be
okay not getting a new phone for a good number of years in a row. I didn't do
that but I think I could have. So this event I think was nice to see go into
something with a little more variety. It wasn't just kind of the same thing you
know but now it's even bigger which it is bigger but there is at least a
smaller option now. So they did also do something I thought was weird though
that usually they were starting to go towards this this method that every
phone was the same it just was a different size which I really loved
because I always hated the fact that oh you want the good camera oh you have to
get the gigantic stupid phone that you don't want oh okay well I guess I'll
settle and get the phone that's you know normal sized so then they went to saying
"Okay, every phone has the same thing,
"except maybe the lower end one has an LCD."
Nah, whatever, that's fine.
Now it's like every phone, same stuff,
with a couple slight little things.
You know, if you want the super ultra fancy camera,
you gotta, again, get the big stupid platter phone.
But now you can get the little tiny phone, the iPhone mini,
which is the best phone ever made,
and still get OLED, still get good cameras,
You still get the ultra wide camera that nobody cares about
and you get all the same stuff,
but in a form factor that A, fits in your pocket
and you can actually put your thumb comfortably
from one side of the screen to the other.
So obviously I'm buying an iPhone mini.
I think that's pretty apparent.
I would normally be a total iPhone pro person
and I'm definitely gonna miss the cameras.
Cameras are one of my favorite things,
but the size absolutely is number one priority for me.
- And I think the cameras on this are so good.
I don't think you will miss the cameras.
I think the computational photography stuff
is so good now that I don't think
that you'll ever look at the photos coming off that thing
and think, "Oh, I kind of, I'm a bit bummed."
- Oh no, I think the quality is gonna be great.
I think it's just that extra telephoto lens
that when you need it,
it's just really nice to have that 2X.
I don't use it a ton, but there's every once in a while where it's like,
ah, if I could just get that little bit extra.
And I was talking to my wife about this and she, she's like, we're kind of
opposite in this, where I was trying to figure out, you know, of a hundred
photos that I take, maybe one is wide angle and that was probably on accident.
You know, 90, 90 of them are probably regular, you know, middle camera.
And then the rest are telephoto where she's, she says she's the opposite
where she's never wide ever, and then mostly 2x,
and then the rest being regular.
So I think for her, if she goes with a mini,
it would be a bigger deal in terms of cameras
that she would have to get used to.
- It really depends what you use it for,
because I use all three lenses a lot,
but more so for video than photography,
and that just has to do with my job,
because I often use my phone when out
to do video work for work.
So I like having that, you know, how you're actually switching between all three lenses
but they try to stitch together seamlessly through software.
So I quite like that range.
But yeah, I mean for you if that's not what you're doing then it's not a huge deal.
So you think you can survive without the telephoto?
I'm gonna have to because the size thing is just so...
I made a cardboard cutout of the iPhone mini.
The exact millimeter dimensions, depth, width and length.
And it is so good.
You're excited.
It feels really good.
I am anxiously awaiting to pre-order and it will be in green.
Oh God.
Perfect choice.
Perfect.
That green.
I love that green.
I've been doing, I've been looking at the, the mini cause I'm, I'm like generations
behind now, so I have a 10 hour, which I had from my past employer and then I left
them and I said, look, can I just buy the phone off you?
So they gave it to me for a few hundred bucks.
So I had a XR because I was going to a new employer, I wasn't sure if they'd give me some Android piece of crap.
So they actually gave me an iPhone SE2.
So I have at the moment now two iPhones, neither of them top-notch, you know, XR, SE2.
But it gives me an interesting insight into the two different sizes.
And I remember the 5, you could just hold it, I could almost spin it, you know, you can spin a pen.
So do the spinning the pen on your thumb. I would almost do that with an iPhone 5
It was just perfectly weighted to just sort of fiddle with so I think if I was buying one
I would probably buy the mini but I do find the 10 are is nicer if I'm reading on
Insta paper or something like that having that bit extra screen for whatever it's worth
I do quite like but I don't do that often enough and you've got an iPad. Well, I've got an iPad
Yeah, that that's where I'm at - where I don't want I don't want a big phone
Like you want a small phone. I think I don't think it's going back to what phones are meant to be
I hope I hope hope this thing sells like crazy
so that there is a
13 or I don't know what they'll call it next year. Maybe we'll finally get rid of the stupid numbers next year. That'd be great
13 next year mini that is truly
Everything, you know, maybe there's a 13 mini Pro
They'll never tell us the sales figures. They will they will have to interpret just based on wandering just what?
Well, I was gonna say walking around
So who knows I reckon you'll get your wish Jason
I reckon we'll all get our wish because always the issue pre iPhone 6 and 6 plus was the screen size
It wasn't the people wanted a gigantic phone with huge bezels the bezels as we all know was just the consequence
So now that we don't have to live that anymore
People can have that large phone screen. They always wanted but something that's pocketable
So I don't think you're wish casting too much there.
I think it's totally realistic that that's where we're going.
When you consider that people say, oh, phones are boring now.
Nothing really changes.
When you look over the past 10 years, more than 10 years,
the innovation has been unbelievable.
It's just these gradual evolutionary steps.
And you end up with this thing, which is almost entirely screen,
but for the face ID notch.
And who knows how that's going to improve?
I don't particularly find that in the way or distracting,
But give it another few years. We're gonna have something even cooler still. Yeah, and speaking mini
I think you also ordered something else Jason. Is that right?
I will be ordering the iPhone mini for sure and and the HomePod mini the HomePod mini yet
Yeah, I'll be ordering one of those as well. They're both I think
November 3rd or 6 I can't remember which but it's whatever is a couple weeks from now. But yeah the HomePod mini
I totally forgot about it. I don't know why it's also awesome, and I cannot believe it's only $99
I mean I say only $99, but when you're looking at like a regular home pod that I think is $299
That's quite a difference considering you get all the same
Stuff it does all the same series stuff
It does the handoff which is gonna have this new handoff thing that's supposed to be even better
It's smaller so it takes up less space. It's a little more inconspicuous. I think than the big home pod
So I yeah, we're gonna get a couple of them
I think because I just I think it's a great little device to have around I would actually probably trade
All of our giant home pods for home pod minis, but I mean that's not realistic
So we'll just keep those but they do seem really cool just to clarify for our listeners as well when when Jason says
$99 he actually means
$149 Australian just doing the conversion there for you
You take the number and then you multiply it by like 11 or something and then you get the price in Australia
I think is how the conversion is working or the scarier price of
469 for the larger one, which is a discount from what it was originally it kills me
Yeah, you you had typed that number in I think chat or something the other day and it was like surely he
Like missed the three and typed the full note. Wow, that's a much too much. That's insane
It's not poor dexterity. It's the truth.
I want, I want to buy another one.
And I just can't, I just at that price with two or three year old technology, I can't do it.
No, I would definitely not recommend that, but I want one.
The regular HomePod I think is like 400% more audio than I need.
They can go really loud.
I have to say, I have a stereo pair because I bought them pretty much when they came out and I got the second one because I managed to find a JB Hi-Fi here in
Australia had them discounted and I went okay that's it that's not justification
for me I'm scooping that up right now so I love that double setup as a bit of a
home theater thing with Apple TV but Andrew I reckon you could justify it
because you said you already have one regular one right yes yep so if you get
two minis they can be the two stereo satellite speakers and the regular HomePod
can be demoted down a level to be like a makeshift subwoofer and suddenly
You have a three speaker
Symmetrically placed. Yeah. Well, it's airplay - that's such a good way to get him to buy home pods. I love it
They go it's an airplay - home theater system in a triangle shape. It's cool. Go for it. Wow. I love it
It's like 3.1 audio right there, isn't it? So what do you use then Andrew? What's your you know?
You don't use home pods because you only have one I'm hearing so what's your what's your quote-unquote home theater?
So I have theater. I have a home pod in the kitchen. Yes, er or re. Oh, sorry
Don't even pretend to spell it the other way.
It's ridiculous.
The theatre.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You do the pompous British better than I do.
This is the BBC.
Do continue, Andrew.
I wish to hear more.
Lovely.
Okay.
Where was I?
Home theatre.
Yes.
So we have a pretty old now, due to be replaced, Samsung LCD TV, which I hate.
We had a friend that worked for Samsung, so we were able to get it cheap at the time.
So it was like, well yeah sure we'll get it, but it's due to be replaced and yeah
it is what it is, but I'm not happy with it. But I keep waiting and thinking, "I'll
put it off a little bit longer." In fact, our entire setup is a bit that way,
because we also have a, I think it's a Yamaha receiver, black box. Weighs 400
pounds. Uh-huh and all it does is it's got a gigantic remote with about 75
buttons on it and basically I use... well the power button doesn't work anymore
because that's been worn out and it toggles and I have HDMI 1, HDMI 2, HDMI 3
and that's as much as it ever does. It is just a routing box and an amplifier. The
reason I have all that though is because I have also old speakers but old
speakers that I love and I don't know if they are as good as I think they are. I
know I paid a lot for them at the time and I think I'm still jaded by the fact
that I paid a lot for them 20 years ago. Made by a Canadian company I don't think
they're around anymore, got energy and they're big. I've got two big bookshelf
like tall tall standing speakers that have about little, about seven speaker
units within them. Then I have the center speaker of the same set and then a subwoofer,
powered subwoofer. So it pumps out some really nice sound. I love them but at the same time
I'm hamstrung by them because they're big and the way that we our house is laid out,
they fit into some furniture we had designed which is good but then you have the problem of,
Geez, TV's got a lot bigger than I ever anticipated.
And it's like, we currently have a 55 inch TV and the next size up is what, I don't know,
what are they?
Seven, 68?
65.
65.
Yeah, whatever that next size up, it is like, the area that I could fit in is like millimeter
tight.
But then the problem is these tall bookshelf speakers are sort of within that range.
So they don't fit.
So I just don't know what to do.
I do have one question for you, Andrew.
This furniture you're describing, I just have an image of those classic gigantic cabinets
that wrap around a TV that are full of your crockery.
It's not that, is it?
In the sort of way, yes, but I hope that it's a more modern take.
But it probably isn't now.
I think I've become a grandparent in a weird way.
There's no stained glass, is there?
There's no stained glass.
There is some clear glass, some see-through glass.
stained glass with the Canyon family crest on it right in the middle.
That's where your Bicentennial coin is, isn't it?
You're onto me.
Front and center.
What about you, Jason?
We've had quite the adventure in theater technology.
Hang on, can we just get Martin to say that again?
Yeah.
Theater technology.
Yeah. We used to have, you know, we've kind of gone the whole thing.
the whole, you know, 28.1 systems and all that crap.
And I hate having all that stuff.
I just don't want stuff.
And then there's like the speakers behind you and you've got to run cables or.
They're wireless and they don't work.
So I don't care about any of that crap anymore.
Um, then we went to like just the sound bar route.
So in our last house, we had the whatever TV and then, um, the, so we used to have
Sonos we used to be a like a Sonos house I guess you could call it prior to
there being HomePods so we had the Sonos Play Bar which sounds great the audio
quality on it's really good and fortunately even if you disregard all
the Sonos special stuff it still just works as a sound bar so we were using
that for a while and then when we moved here we left our old TV at our old house
we got a new TV so we got we kind of just went you know we're getting a new
TV from the new house, let's just go big.
So we got the LG OLED 77 something or other, whatever.
It's a big ass TV.
Uh, it's OLED looks amazing.
Quality is fantastic.
It runs webOS, which is great.
I really like it.
It's the only TV.
Oh, I can't say TVOS now.
It's the only television operating system that is not complete trash.
Does it have the penguin pointer?
Uh, yeah, it does.
So it's got the little, the little remote that you can move around and it's got the
little arrow and you can click on stuff, which pretty good.
It's, I don't know.
It's better than kind of clicking around.
I suppose.
Have you noticed that when you scroll on that little thing, the little scroll
wheel, it makes it sweat.
Oh no, I haven't seen.
Penguin sweats.
No.
It's bizarre.
That's weird.
Oh, I know that when you get to the bottom, it does this nice little,
like bouncing animation to tell you that you're at the bottom of the list.
So there's, there has been actually some, some thought put into it,
which I think is nice.
We have all of our inputs going into the TV.
So the TV is kind of the master switching thing.
And initially we hooked up the Sonos to it.
Cause we're like, well, we have it still.
Let's just use that for whatever reason.
And this is going to sound insane, but apparently if you spend a small
Fortune on television the speakers in it can actually be not complete crap. Oh, come on now
we we've just been using the TV as
Speakers. No, it's really good
Like it doesn't make any sense, but it sounds great. It sounds I wouldn't know that it was the TV speakers
It doesn't sound tinny. It doesn't sound hollow. It fills the room his room feel. Yeah. Yeah, that's an embarrassment
You should be ashamed. I wouldn't tell anyone I would only tell you guys but it's yeah tell everyone else
I've got some crazy audio thing, but I'm just using the TV and it sounds great
Should we turn to media corner and something we've actually consumed
I would love to do media corner and I think it would be fun to just share
something music movie book
eight track
something from the from the TV cabinet at Andrews house
Anything really? I'll get a little something. It's not from the cabinet and it's nothing earth-shattering. It's literally just what I've been reading
I've been getting some high quality literature into me. It's a book called Olive again by Elizabeth Strout
I believe she's one of Oprah's book club favorite. Olive again a
Story an anthology story I would say about a group of disparate people almost short stories within each chapter
People living in Maine sounds like an amazing place. I like it. It's just an interesting reflection on what?
People's lives could be and that people living in you know
one town
Yeah
town city pick your location really is that people can have all these different lives and all these things are going on around you and
Sometimes it's of their own doing and sometimes it's just because that's the way life goes
All these individual stories are linked together by this character Olive Kitteridge. Olive again is the second
Sequel to the book Olive Kitteridge. I've read them both. I really like them well-written
Feel like you're getting a bit of it's like reading a bit of meat
Yeah, you sure you chew on it and you think about it and you contemplate it and it takes you to that look that place
And you really get interested in the location. It's like the location is a character in itself
My mother apparently bless her. I don't think she liked it. She said to me
I just want a book with a beginning a middle and an end
She's not really into it as much as I am too much meandering her. I believe so
I believe so, but ironically, I think she just is fulfilling the
She's playing the role of the lead character Olive, I think
Was the first book something that you normally seek out this kind of genre or was it a surprise was it a recommendation
How did it come about? It isn't the kind of thing I would normally read. I do like those sort of character driven books
But no, this is very different to what I would normally read I think so
Yeah, highly highly recommended physical book or digital book the first one all leave Kitteridge
I have on the Kindle the second one
I bought as a hardcover book as I just wanted it that way
The thing I found that as I'm going back to the Kindle again because just in terms of media corner
I've also bought a subscription to Readwise.
Readwise.io.
I just bought an annual subscription.
So basically it sucks in all your highlights from different reading sources, whether that
be Kindle or Instapaper.
Anytime you highlight anything or make notes in those apps, it basically sucks those up
and then provides you with a daily review.
It'll pick five or six of those highlights that you've made over time and present them
back to you.
It has like a tagging system and all those sorts of things
I've been using that as a way of
Bringing back some of the highlighted notes that I've read in things in the past because otherwise you read them and then you totally forget
About them again. That's a really good point. Are you both familiar with the philosopher Alain de Botton? He runs the School of Life
Yes. Yeah, he gave this great speech years ago
I think it was at TED called atheism 2.0 and he made the point that
regardless of, you know, your own personal belief or whatever.
One thing in secular society in general is that, or at least Western society, is that we read a book
and we hurry up and we move on and we don't revisit things.
So it almost sounds like there's a lot of management involved in this,
but it's nice to be reminded of things that you read because too often we just read,
move on and forget. We don't have that habitual returning to the ideas that we've been exposed to.
Yeah, yeah, that's right. It's nice. And some of the things that you highlight,
you think, "Oh, that was pretty clever of me to highlight that."
just on the read wise, it's pretty clever as well.
Like I just as a test, I had the hardcover version of this Olive again book, and I
took a photo of one of the pages and then it doesn't OCR on the page and then let
you select with the iOS app, almost like just using the tech selection system to
select it and then it can create a highlight from a printed book.
That's pretty cool.
Pretty cool.
Wow.
Yeah.
I, with the highlights, I did the same thing.
I mostly was school books. I would realize that I would highlight stuff.
I never went back and looked at it.
And I think the only reason I was highlighting is because it was a way to trick
myself into making sure I was paying attention to whatever the heck I was
actually looking at and not just like going through the motions.
But if I was highlighting,
it somehow made me think I need to actively only highlight good stuff.
Yeah.
So I think that's why that was,
but I never actually went back and referenced it.
Kids these days, they've got it so good.
I'd like to recommend a movie that we went to watch at the cinema recently, if you know
what that is, or theatre, depending on your country of origin.
So it was a movie called The Translators, it's a French film, so already half the audience
has switched off because they don't like subtitles, but bear with me here.
It's a really interesting whodunit movie, I think it was actually released last year,
but you know how these things operate, it takes a full year to reach us here in the
Antipodes it's about this fictitious best-selling novel and I'm not gonna spoil anything
But it's like a you know Millennium trilogy like the girl with the dragon tattoo and stuff
Imagine a phenomenon like that, but it's called Daedalus the publishing house called angstrom
With you know, the head guy called Eric is really obsessed with not letting the details or any of the pages of the third book
Leak so what he does is he gets all of the translators from the top markets where the book sells
Brings them into a French manner and puts them in lockdown appropriate for 2020
Underground for the duration of the translation period so that nothing leaks of course
Things don't go exactly to plan and it spirals out of control
These French people made this really interesting sort of whodunit thriller about translating a novel
And it's really fascinating. I love it. That sounds awesome
Yeah, it's really interesting and it's sort of and I don't want to denigrate Hollywood because lots of good stuff does come out of Hollywood
But it's you know a European reimagining of a general mystery film something surprised some things you may not like
There is a particular scene which I will say if you watch it involves
How do I put this politely?
Various people who don't have English as a native language singing a song in English and it just reeks of Eurovision
So you're enjoying this movie going, oh, you know, this is pretty intense.
And then suddenly they're all singing. You're going, please don't do that.
And you're just cringing and then you move on and then it makes sense in the story. But you go,
why did we just have to go to Eurovision 2020? Oh, that's right, because it was cancelled.
You said you went to a cinema to see this. Was this because of what's happening now?
Was this one of those special type theaters or was this at the quote,
normal theater but they're just kind of doing different things now to get more people in.
This one's a smaller independent one so they don't really block the seats out but there'll
be a cap on the ticket sales as far as I'm aware. But for that movie we went with my mom and sister
and Natasha and I did and there were only two other people in the cinema so we had an entire
large theater room to six people. So it's sad for the cinema but it was a great experience to have
have it on the large screen and have none of the rustling plastic bags and
chip packets and all of that rubbish so it was really good.
That's cool, okay. You can throw Jaffas and hit nobody. Translation, please.
Oh, Jaffa. Do they not have that in the US? Probably, but I'm sure it's not called
that. It's like a chalk orange ball. Imagine a Malteser, but it's hard so it
has some... if you were to throw it at somebody it hurts if it hits you in the
back of the head. Oh sorry I just realized I should have translated what I just said
to chocolate orange not chalk orange more of this contraction and abbreviation. It'll
be a show notes I'll look it up. They're quite delicious. Jaffer. No no no not Jaffer. Jaffa.
Jaffa. Jaffa. I know our accents throw you off you think everything could end with an
er but it's an a we got you. Or an re don't forget that. Oh god that's true. So moving
Moving on to my media corner, since we did a book, we did a movie, and I'm glad I didn't
pick either.
I picked music this time, so we got something different.
We didn't even coordinate that.
I'm going to go with an artist/album.
The artist is Courtney Barnett, coincidentally from Australia.
Didn't even really know that, but after you listen to it, obviously.
I'm no music critic, but I think her style is just very unique, and it's the kind of
of music where if you went into like a coffee shop and you heard it, you don't
have to even hear the words, but you're just kind of naturally into it.
Then when you actually listen to it back later and hear the lyrics, it
becomes even that much more interesting to you as you're hearing what she's saying.
So I think the album I would start with is, um, I believe it's called
sometimes I sit and think, and sometimes I just sit, I think is what it's called.
That's correct.
And it's just a really good album.
It's got a funny little drawing of like a weird perspective on a rug and a chair,
which is irrelevant to the music, but definitely check it out.
Courtney Barnett, it's everywhere. It's on all your normal music things.
But, um, yeah, that's my, that's my pick and it's from, she's from Sydney.
So there you go. Full, full circle on that.
She is fantastic. I'm glad you brought her up.
I never would have thought she would come up. Do you remember, I mean,
you said you've listened to the album.
Was there a song that stood out or any particular moments?
I could, this is an album that I listened front to back on generally every time.
I I'm, I'm not really an album person or a individual song person.
A lot of times it's just like put on some.
Apple music radio station and let it happen.
But every once in a while, there's an album that is just, it just makes sense
to go front to back, and this is one of them for me, if I had a big set of
liner notes for it, I'd probably be sitting there looking at it alongside the
album but no nothing in particular it's just kind of front to back I would say
jump in and go for it I mean right from the very beginning the very first song
elevator operator is like you're in and you're gonna notice like you know 45
minutes go by and now the album is over and why is it over I think she would
probably give a pretty good lesson in Australian vernacular because like you
said she has a very yeah he's nodding she has a very distinctive singing style
where it's almost like she's talk yelling.
Yes.
But yeah, I couldn't describe it either, but that's why I was.
Yeah.
When you're in the coffee shop and you hear it, you're not even hearing the words.
You're just like, yeah, the music's really good.
Then you start listening to the lyrics and you're like, oh, this is OK.
Yep. Keep going.
Then you start hearing some of the Australian isms in there as well.
And it's like, wow, this is like so much more complex than you even thought at first.
It sounds simple, but is complex.
Again, not a music critic, but that's my take on it.
- I've added it to my library.
I shall listen.
- And that brings us to the conclusion of Media Corner.
- Now look, I might be taking the show
in an undesired direction here,
but ever since you wrote plus cool accents
on the website, Jason,
I've been fascinated to know what this show would sound like
if we swapped accents.
- Oh, you don't want me to do that.
There'll be zero listeners left.
- Is this a challenge?
Are you throwing down the gauntlet here?
Are we to do our best accents?
I mean, if you want to, I mean, there's no pressure.
You've seen movies which are generally US centric coming out of most production
houses. You've heard Australian accents from movies, from people that are not
from Australia. And they're trying and they're getting paid a lot of money to
do it. And that's still really bad.
I'm here for free.
You don't want that.
It'll be authentic.
I know that.
I think people are demanding to hear it.
- I'm still trying to just learn some words
that are different.
- The only American accent I can do
is basically a replication of my dad's
Southern Texan sort of drawl.
- Wow.
- So let's see if I can try and channel my father.
Oh, Jason, I wonder what might you be talking to?
I'm looking at that microphone and I'm thinking,
Why is it so phallic looking?
It's a strange thing
Jason are you here?
Jason my oh my when you're addressing this court, you will rise
Speak to me in a clear intelligible voice
Oh god
I think we broke. I think you broke Jason
He's gone sound half asleep and half like you're on some kind of like
Yeah, you pretty much summed up my dad
You just got your wisdom teeth pulled or something and they accidentally like quadrupled the dose of whatever the pain meds are
I and you're just like out there like that kid the YouTube video of that kid that got his teeth
Fixed or whatever and he's just like so high in the backseat. That's what that sounds like
That's brilliant, well, I don't have any American relatives to channel but I
I'll be honest there are times when we've just gone out shopping and I've just put on an accent going through the shops with Natasha
And she's just like please you just don't do that. Come on. Let's be English today. Let's come on
It's not Ned Flanders
No, I'll just go around saying well even in the US
I was walking around just to see if people would pick up and I just say excuse me
How much is this they never batted an eyelid and I thought they're either really polite or I'm convincing and I don't know
Yeah, I mean
They're probably just polite
(laughing)
- Or everyone just ignores everyone anyway,
so they didn't even really know you were there.
- Come on, Jason, give it your best shot.
- I think if you just add mate to the end,
that pretty much does it, right?
- It'll take you a long way. - Mate.
- Talk quickly, don't enunciate, and finish with mate.
- What's the name of a grocery store there?
- Woolies.
- See, I don't, Woolies?
Was that W-O-O, like wool?
- It's short for Woolworths. - Like sheep?
It's actually called Woolworths, but nobody calls it Woolworths.
Going down to the Woolies to get a chock chip, mate.
That's not a knife.
That's a knife.
That wasn't bad.
No, no, that was good.
It was channeling some cockney, but...
Yeah, that's all I know is the...
Yeah, it's like, that's how it comes out.
It comes out really...
Righto, governor.
...a little bit rude.
Right, you are.
Yeah, basically.
Yeah.
I'm gonna stick with what I got.
I think we should probably stay in the correct hemisphere, maybe.
One thing I want, I'm going to give you one more challenge because this is fun.
Okay.
I want you to say, can you chuck me a choc chip biscuit mate?
Can you chuck me a choc chip biscuit mate?
He got around the tongue twister.
There, there are some chitches.
I've had coffee.
I'm good, but it wouldn't be a biscuit.
It'd be a Bickey.
Who am I?
What am I thinking?
What are you?
You're not even Australian.
What a fraud a choc chip Mickey have I just seen the cancellation of this showed you to this introduced segment
Oh, yeah, if this makes it in the whole thing is getting banned from iTunes
All right, is it called iTunes still what it wears I don't know if you find this disturbing
Jason but something I've always noticed like you say iTunes
Australians put this chip in there. Have you ever noticed that we iTunes it's iTunes
Not that one's wrong or right, but I've always noticed like every Apple keen. It was like iTunes and I'm thinking I'm saying iTunes over here
anyway
What does this guy say it iTunes? I'm saying iTunes. This is so weird
but loony tunes
Yeah, exactly. Loony tunes. Is it loony tunes?
That's it. Oh
Loony tunes, which probably just sounds ridiculous to you and tunes actually makes more sense because it's like T when a or T double-o
Yeah, but we're just saying tunes over here. Whatever a tune is.
You're just putting a ch in there. Just a little added flavor.
Tunes. All these words are losing meaning for me now.
You say something too many times.
[Music]
I do have a question, even if this doesn't make it in, I have a question.
Um, it's October, whatever day it is.
20th, October 31st is Halloween.
Is that a thing in Australia?
I've been wondering about that.
If, if a, does anyone care and if they do, is it like, what extreme is it on?
Is, is it just acknowledged or is it like we go all out costumes, decorating parties?
What is it like there?
And maybe it's even different coast to coast.
Yeah, yeah, look I've got I've got strong opinions on this when I was a kid
Halloween was most definitely not a thing
To the point where we actively rebelled against it
It was like that is a piece of American garbage. You did not we are not Americans
Don't bring it into Australia. It's just
You know a ridiculous thing that we don't do here. Just you're pretty neutral
Nobody did it. It was
Nowhere around now. I swear since I've become a parent
suddenly
Everybody says oh, it's so much fun. Let's do Halloween and
to the point where I feel like
Everybody's trying to relive like a scene from an American movie and make it like the most epic
Halloween event ever kids getting dressed up people
Jazzing up their house
massively
And then the kids going around trick-or-treating.
Oh man, I'm so sad there's not a different term for it.
I was hoping that you were going to have some special thing for trick-or-treating.
No, it's just trick-or-treating.
Like Puzzle and Lolly or something.
Something, yeah. I thought there would be...
Exactly.
Puzzle and Lolly, Governor.
Oh yes, that's a good idea.
I could get behind that one, that's pretty good.
So no, it's annoying because it's a complete rip-off import from American culture.
So it's basically Valentine's Day, it's just you buy stuff.
It's just the time for people to buy stuff, basically.
Yeah, and that's what bothers me more so.
I mean, I'm not terribly bothered by the national element of it.
I can understand what you're saying, Andrew, growing up.
But these days, we're so saturated with American culture anyway that that's not too bothersome
for me.
Pick and choose what you want.
what's more egregious is that it's 100% commercial. At least in the US there's
some sort of history or cultural aspect to it or some sort of, I don't know
whether it's pagan or satanic element whether you agree with it or not, but
here it's just "oh okay well we've got some shop displays that are blank
between you know Easter and Christmas or whatever's going on let's just like I
don't know if you've seen Andrew but Freddo's like the chocolate bars they've
got Freddo's with fangs like a vampire Freddo the frog and I think this is
Blatant so if there were more of a history to it or like you said Jason we put our own spin on it
Not a problem. Not an issue. So it sounds like we need to start exporting more ghosts to you guys
Yeah, yeah supernatural is fine. Just bring it up. Okay. Yeah, at least there's a reason I'll work on that
I don't think we have any sanctions in place currently for ghosts. So I'll see what I can do
So you having to dress up your hat you don't have kids Jason
but are you expected to dress up your house and be answering the front door to
Hordes of children in my standard 2020 answer. I don't know what the hell you're going on point didn't yeah
So I forgot for a moment. Yeah, we just moved a couple months ago. So I don't even know like what the
Protocol is here in terms of you know, what people are into because it varies neighborhood to neighborhood town to town
I mean sometimes
There'll be a town though
Previously, I mean there'd be people that would they would take their kids and like travel to a different town
Because like that was the good town to go trick-or-treating and so forth
So I don't know what it's like here currently and then on top of that
I can't think of a worse thing than to have a child
Go to a hundred houses of strangers reach their hand into a dirty bowl full of crappy candy and then touch their face
Because they've got a mask on constantly. It just seems like a recipe for disaster
So I I don't know what we're gonna do my my initial thought is to just put a bowl of stuff on the porch and
Never open the door and just hope it works out for him
I mean, well, it sounds better than putting it like a bottle of sanitizer and a QR code for sign in on your porch
I don't think that's very feasible
Well, that was my next thought was I would just do like a giant bucket full of hand sanitizer with all the candy in it
So it'd be kind of gross for Halloween and all the candy would just be already sanitized
Then when they took our candy put it in their bag
The sanitizer would spread and try to help get rid of the other gross candy disease
So this is just sounding like a horror film now. I don't know what's coming
Bottom line it's not really a thing in Australia. It sounds like and you've been it's been forced upon you and
And now you have to do it. Yes. I'll be honest when I was still living at home. We often contemplated
turning off the lights to pretend that no one was home just because we weren't prepared. It
seems rude probably 20 Americans listening but we went what's the custom? Do we what do we give them
like do they just want bags of corn chips because that's all we've got here. Just don't give an

everyone. Australians let us rejoice for we are free of Halloween.
