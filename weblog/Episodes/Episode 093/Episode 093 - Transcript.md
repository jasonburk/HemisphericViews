All right, we're away.
We are away.
Welcome.
So this is a bit weird.
It's a bit weird because people can't see this but we're not talking with video on like we normally do.
So I'm just seeing you a little it's not an emoji.
It's like an illustrated version of you and Jason's not on the call yet, even though he's the host.
So I think he's joining.
He will be joining.
So we don't know what we're doing.
It's all very strange.
The first time in what, 93, we'll say 93 episodes that we've done a podcast.
And I think this is, we've never not looked at each other while we've done them.
No. And you said it was something to do with Spider-Man downloads in your house.
It's bandwidth. So.
Yeah. So I had to downgrade my, my internet plan because, you know, Australia's internet plans are so fast that you don't need the top one, right?
I had to limit for budgetary reasons, I've downsized my internet pipe, which is on the
whole hasn't been a huge problem.
Like I still get what I need, but when the kids are trying to download 70 gigabytes of
Spider-Man game and they're desperate to play it, I'm trying to facilitate more rapid download
at their end.
So let's hope this recording even works.
Who knows?
We'll see.
does join he won't see our faces and he'll just be like what the hell's going on so that'll be confusing maybe we'll turn it on back then cuz.
I don't know if I can do this the whole time I don't know well let's say let's say.
[Music]
We're a bit confused as well because our run sheet situation is still a little bit fluid, shall we say.
This week as we're preparing our show partner and I.
What should you do not studiously.
Do you support Martin beautifully thank you entering ideas and thoughts into craft the app that we have used since the initiation of our show.
Only to find out at the last minute Jason has been continuing to populate the free form that we started last week the last four.
I had to redownload the app.
I got rid of it.
(laughing)
- You know, Apple's in trouble
when Mr. Default Martin Feld has to re-download
the default Apple whiteboard app.
This is a concern.
- Well, look, I think it's clever.
I think it's great.
I have nothing against the app.
It's just not the way that I think for myself.
Great way of collaborating with YouTube or other people,
but if it's just sitting on my phone and not doing anything,
I'm not gonna keep downloading updates, but here we are.
We've got a bunch of sticky notes and pictures.
Most of them are purple,
which is Jason's color apparently, and he's not here.
So I reckon we should just go for one of yours first.
I've got two basketballs in my view.
Which one do you want to start with?
- Neither of them, because-
- Neither of them?
- Neither of them.
I want to bring to point a thing that I thought of
just before we clicked record,
before I forget about Freeform,
seeing as we're talking about Freeform.
So I still don't know the app.
I haven't dedicated my 60 minutes of learning time
as I like to do with the Apple apps, as you know.
And I was just clicking around in it here on the Mac app
and trying to change the font.
And I thought that's fine.
I could probably, I don't know, there's probably a toolbar.
No, no toolbar for a font.
So, okay, well, maybe there's a, like a side panel
like you get in pages and all the modern Apple apps
have that sort of fixed sidebar where you can change the properties.
No, there isn't.
Turns out there's a little option to toggle on the fonts panel.
Fonts panel?
Which takes you back to that early era Mac OS font panel thing.
You know, the little picker that has all your listed fonts?
Oh yeah, like the floating inspector thing or whatever.
Yeah, yeah.
Which is a total throwback to early Mac OS design,
when the floating panels and the inspectors
all over the screen were the kind of the way they did it.
And then over the years,
they've consolidated down into sidebars
and fixed panels within the application window.
But here's this new free format,
and the fonts choice is still managed
by this old style picker.
I thought it was a little odd.
- It does pop up in certain apps that I've seen.
I'm just trying to think what they are.
Maybe certain pickers, does Pixelmator have that?
I know it has an inspector,
but I'm sure that I've seen in different apps
it's come up so you can toggle things like color.
- Yeah, like it's very much,
it's the most pure default font picker at the system level.
But you know how pages and numbers
have all abstracted that away
and they have the side panels.
And I sort of see freeform as kind of like
the modern addition to the iWork suite.
And I was just surprised that it didn't have a side panel
on their Mac application.
Maybe it's a catalyst thing.
(upbeat music)
My desk situation.
This is horrendous.
My desk is a disaster.
I should say, let me rephrase.
My desk was a disaster
because the last couple of recordings I've done
with my MacBook Air, not having enough USB ports,
you know, running no monitors, just the laptop.
You guys were looking up my nose with the video,
all those problems.
The desk was horrendous.
And I have a photo in that free form
of said desk looking horrendous.
It's disgusting.
- Looking at it now.
- I want you to absolutely have at me,
but I want you to know that you cannot have at me now
because the iMac is back.
- So are you saying this photo is no longer relevant?
So I'm roasting the past?
- You are roasting the past,
but it was a valid part of my past.
I have to accept it.
I have to live with it.
But the iMac has returned to its glory.
The Intel iMac is now my studio station,
my recording studio.
It's beautiful.
- Is Jason in the free form now?
'cause there's just a gigantic eggplant emoji
that's gone over your photo.
- I'm noticing that.
I'm thinking that.
(laughing)
Thinking we've been free form bombed.
He's not talking to us.
- What is he doing?
- He's roasting my desk, I think, with an eggplant.
- Right, well, to answer the question about the photo
that I used to be able to see,
check the show notes.
I'm sure we'll have it linked there
or maybe even the artwork.
Who knows, it's up to you, Andrew, as editor.
I'm a little bit confused about what's actually going on
for where your hands go,
because you've got the MacBook Air there,
but then you've got the iPad Pro in the Magic Keyboard,
which looks like the thing that you're using
may be connected to the secondary display
as your larger panel, but then you're kind of off-center.
So are you kind of doing a desktop twisted shift
to the left thing, like when you have a Windows PC laptop
that has nothing centered,
like the track pad to the side and the num pad.
Are you kind of deliberately twisting your spine
to be uncomfortable?
- That's a good point.
It looks like I've been using the double monitor setup,
doesn't it?
Like using this, the sidecar of the iPad.
Are you suggesting that?
Yeah, I didn't think about that.
- Well, I'm just not sure.
- I didn't, I didn't use it at all like that.
That was just randomly placed
'cause I was just shoving stuff around.
That's how messy this desk was.
So the iPad and the iMac were unlinked
in terms of screen sharing or anything like that.
They were just chucked there.
And I would basically just roll my chair from side to side
to try and center my keyboard
on the device that I was wanting to use.
- So you were doing the Dr. Evil side to side,
Dr., you know, with Mr. Bigglesworth on your lap
and getting dragged away
just to move to the other side of your desk.
- It's nothing like having a rolling chair.
It's fantastic.
Yeah, so that was not great.
Anything else you wanna make a comment on?
- Well, look, I reckon Jason would probably rip you
to shreds over this photo, but I'm not so offended by it.
I look at this and I go, okay, that's not how I would do it,
but I know that this is actually a real setup.
This is how you were using it.
You know, when you see YouTube videos
of the dream desk situation,
and it's this minimalist paradise
that's never even had a tiny speck of dust land on it,
and you just know that it's fake.
I look at this and I go, that's how you're doing it.
Right now on my desk, I've got camera stuff everywhere.
There are lenses just sitting here and it's a mess.
And it's annoying me, but it's like that
because I've been using stuff.
It's not all put away for a real estate photo, right?
So I think good on you.
This is a real view into your life,
even though it's outdated.
And Jason might have to share what he thinks later
and utterly destroy you.
- Wow, that's really, really kind.
I thought you would mention all sorts of devices
that are on that desk.
You're not giving me a hard time.
I think it's wonderful.
Thank you.
- You know, each to their own.
I'm sure you'd look at my desk and go,
you know, what is on this desk?
I don't like it.
But then, eh, Martin probably has a reason
and it doesn't really affect me, so we'll move on.
And that's where it's interesting.
And this is actually something I wanted to ask both of you,
but Jason's still not here to actually answer it.
I'm known as the Feldfoot on this podcast, right?
- Yes.
- And maybe for very good reason,
but we end up with these moments
were you seen pleasantly surprised
that I'm not raining dictatorial wrath down upon you, right?
So then I think, well, what actually makes me a feldfoot?
And I was talking to Natasha about this,
and she said, "Well, Martin, you're very serious.
You can joke, but you're a very serious person."
And I thought, interesting.
I wonder what the guys think about this on the podcast.
So to totally put you on the spot,
what actually makes me a feldfoot?
Am I serious?
What is it all about.
I do feel on the spot man this is nerve wracking because great offense.
You're a fell foot because you are very clear in your desires.
And what you want you leave no one in any doubt about what that is so you're very you're very confident self confident in expressing your feelings and I think other people might be more worried about social norms.
I must say should I say that all it cause offense do I just you know sort of.
Abrogate my own feelings and let somebody else have their way yet even if that way isn't ideal or is.
I'm inefficient or just not appropriate for the time sometimes think I was let them I'll let them have that win.
Martin Feld you are not like that you are much more about no I know the the canonically correct way of dealing with this and I will express it and I'll make sure that everybody else is aware of it as well because I am actually doing them a service I am educating them in correctness.
And usually your things are coming from that point of correctness. It's not like you're just expressing opinions in a forceful way.
It's kind of more annoying than that because often what you're saying is correct.
You know, so you can't argue the logical truth of it all because you're correct. Does that make sense?
So I think in that way you are footish. You put your foot down in a correct way.
I have to say I'm seriously impressed with that answer. That was for someone who said that he
found it nerve-wracking or didn't know what to say or put you on the spot. That was, let's just say,
I feel seen very, very soon. And it's hilarious because as I asked the question, I received an
iMessage from Natasha, who's just on the other side of the house right now. And her iMessage
reads and I quote, "You even sound serious now."
You do.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't think I have another setting.
I think I'm being casual with someone that's like, "Oh my God."
We've been doing this show for like over two years.
You're with somebody I think you know relatively well and you're still, "Well, Andrew, let
me explain to you.
Freeform."
I don't think I have another way of speaking.
I don't.
- There appears to be an eggplant emoji
placed over the photo that I'm viewing.
Who might that be editing?
- Do you feel like you're listening
to the world's smarmiest audio book?
Oh, I'm glad I asked this.
- That could be a career change for you.
Pivot into audio book reading,
'cause you do have a lovely radio voice.
I must say, your voice is more pleasant to listen to than mine.
And I can just imagine you reading.
I think you need to do nonfiction, though.
I don't think you do characters, could you?
Are you Stephen Fry?
Do you have Stephen Fry in you?
Can you do voices and accents?
I can do some. I reckon.
OK, here we go. Future podcast segment for Hemispheric Views.
If you, Andrew, and we can do it for each other, if you like, if you can choose a passage from any book,
kind of like what they used to do with Spix and Spex where they had to sing along to a book. Did
you ever see that? Oh, no. I never really liked that show. It was too... I'm talking about you
being highly correct, but I didn't like it because there wasn't enough structure.
They would ramble too long. Oh, okay. I'll try not to ramble, Andrew. Jeez,
I know the restrictions now. But yeah, if you can choose a passage from maybe one of your
Favorite books or something and then I will read it in a future episode and you can judge my audio book ability and maybe we can even get you or Jason to do it because Jason would appeal obviously to the large US market or audience in a way that they might find me confusing.
That is true.
That's a good idea we should do that and also I do owe you an apology because I said you don't do accents but you do do a fantastic for out.
Thank you.
I like.
Have to give credit where it's due.
Yeah, that is an excellent accent.
Well, thanks.
Well, look, I didn't.
I just thought maybe you'd say, oh, because this bit of that, but that was the most.
How do I put it?
It was a comprehensive breakdown where I've obviously opened up all aspects of my personality through this podcast and I can't hide anymore.
So Andrew, beautifully done.
Well did you have a mini mini media corner within the segment did you ever see a show called Ladder to Lady.
That ring that sounds really vaguely familiar but that was isn't that like a British thing where they.
They take a real like Ruffles guts kind of person do them up it's English rights they get some some woman from Liverpool.
That's right exactly and one of the things that they would do other than flower arrangements and you know how to wear dresses correctly and stuff it was ridiculous but it was kind of funny they used to do elocution lessons I feel like I'm the opposite and I need to learn to speak normally.
You need to do this allocation de allocation.
Yeah exactly just don't speak like you're delivering a lecture the whole time.
Okay let's try that off the cuff okay I want to hear Martin as casual as he can possibly be right now.
Can't really really lean into it.
You're right what do you want.
Talk about going to the footy on the weekend or something.
Shit.
I'm already overthinking what to say.
This is bad and I would I just can't say mate naturally.
Okay, I'll help frame it.
Okay, so I know you're in a rugby state, but I don't know rugby at all.
I know a bit of AFL, so you're going to have to work on here.
Okay, so you're going to watch, let's say the Sydney Swans.
Okay, it's a local derby, Sydney Swans against Greater Western Sydney.
You're going to watch the game and it's been a tight first half.
There's a goal the difference, six points the difference and you're off to get it.
you're off to get a pie.
And you're talking about the game.
- You're at the game with me?
- While you're getting a pie.
Yeah, yeah.
And we're walking the corridor to the pie shop
at halftime talking about the game.
And you are barricading for Sydney
and you're six points down.
- Six points down, okay.
Oh, (beep) that first half was shit.
You want a pie, Andrew?
- Yeah, I suppose, mate.
Come on, let's go.
It's only six points, don't worry.
Your team's trying hard, but let's face it,
You're still going to lose.
Oh, piss off.
Anyway, you want chunky beef or
your mushroom guy?
Mate, it's a footy. You don't get choice.
You just get what you're given.
Just get me two sauces.
I'm trying to be nice here. I'm trying to be nice.
So what, tomato sauce?
You want sauce?
Tomato sauce?
No, I want bloody...
Boop.
This is the most ridiculous conversation.
I'm not even doing it properly.
Can't even talk properly.
I can't even talk properly.
Oh man that was terrible.
Oi!
How you going mate?
F***ing bogans.
How long have you been here?
Kicking out the guts mate.
Hey guys, how's it going?
How long have you been here for?
Just got here. What's up?
How's the show going? Is it going good?
Why the f***
is everyone off video?
Australian Internet.
What?
What the hell does that mean?
I have infinite bandwidth.
Turn on your video.
I'm fine.
Sorry kids.
That's just added another 45 minutes to your download time.
How are you Bogans doing today?
Pretty poorly.
If you judge my performance, it'll make sense when you hear it later.
Andrew is fine.
He sounds like a normal person.
But anyway, I don't actually know in that skit.
What you just missed was the ultimate like corporate skip to guys ever do those like training days and you'd have to roleplay.
And you'd be given like a script or something as part of the learning experience and you'd have to take on a character.
They always crap and everybody always hates it and feel super uncomfortable and you never like you're aware that you're acting but you try and be normal but then you know that you're being trying to be normal and you're acting.
Yeah but it's like that like improv me and Martin just did that.
Andrew and I were just doing it but I reckon now it's Jason's turn with Andrew and I will set a corporate one.
Okay.
All right, please do first person to get closest to the number I'm thinking of you have to guess will be the boss in the situation.
Between 1 and 14.
No, it's just anywhere.
Oh, but yeah, just anywhere.
1492.
I was 572.
So Andrew is the boss.
Yes.
Wow.
Okay.
- Okay.
(laughing)
- Hey language, I'm gonna edit this.
- Okay, let's go.
- I already spoke.
- Stop making my life hard.
- Oh, sorry.
- Beep.
- So hard to put those beeps in.
- All right, so this is gonna be a performance review,
which is really just about setting KPIs for the year,
but following that, there's a little disciplinary section
where Andrew wants to discuss Jason's interesting decision
to place suggestive eggplants on the team free form.
Go.
- So Jason, Jason, it's been a good year.
I've really appreciated the work you've done.
- Thank you.
- You've kicked a lot of goals.
We've had some wins.
- A lot of wins, yeah.
- The charts are all pointing in the right direction,
which as you know.
- Up into the right, baby.
- You got it, man.
That's what I love about you, Jason.
You're so on point with this stuff.
- Yeah.
- There are, however, some issues
we might need to deal with here.
- Tell me more.
- Look, and don't take this the wrong way.
You're a great team player.
So many people love the contributions you make.
They do.
Just sometimes, just sometimes I think you act before you think.
Tell me more.
Can you give me, can you give me an example?
So recently you'll be aware of our new collaborative whiteboarding solution.
Yes.
Yeah.
Um, and I feel that that's really, yeah, yeah.
It's working well for the team.
I actually integrated that into the company as a solution.
So you're welcome.
Yeah.
But Jason, Jason, you also integrated an eggplant into a photo.
Yeah.
Yeah, because it was it was it was a growing topic and I was just trying to illustrate
that the topic was top of mind.
Yeah, it really grew and it grew to a size that was probably causing some of our colleagues
here in the office some level of discomfort.
Oh, okay.
I could shrink it.
I could shrink it down if that would help.
Could you flip it?
Could you give it a 180?
I'm not sure if the application is capable of that, but I could try.
Uh, no, it looks like that is something I will have to file as a radar.
Okay.
If you could go, if you could just go ahead and probably get rid of the eggplant for
now, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I think maybe we can, can we run
with a peach?
Done.
Yeah.
So I think that's, that's better.
That's, that's.
Is it okay if I place it upon the photo of your absolutely shite desk?
Is that okay?
And scene.
I just wanted to make sure that it was okay, given that you are quote unquote,
the boss, that it was okay that I put this emoji on top of your, um,
less than adequate desk.
That was a great scene. Well done.
And I was totally convinced because Andrew was trying to be really professional
and really polite and I could just tell Jason does not take shit.
Yeah, I would not hire Jason in a million years.
Yeah, no, absolutely.
And as far as his management style, he can, uh, I won't say it because then he'll
have to bleep another thing.
I'll save you the trouble.
What do you think of that desk anyway?
Hmm.
Well, I mean, it, it's a desk, I guess, technically.
There's a lot going on there.
Have you, have you all already gone through this, uh, exercise of
Martin was inadequate.
Oh, really?
Let me move this giant peach real quick.
Let me get that out of the way, even though it's very fitting for what the
desk is, um, let me move it over.
Um, I would just say there's just, there's, there's a lot of confusion here.
I don't think, you know, who you want to be in this world, given
the things that are on this desk.
And I think you could use some reflection in terms of who you really want to be as a--
I have reflected.
Oh, you have?
OK.
This is an old photo.
Yeah, it sure is.
OK.
Two weeks old.
OK.
The highlighters are still actually there.
I haven't gotten to moving them yet.
So you still got the highlighters.
You still have the little notebook, I assume.
Yep, that's right here, actually.
Yeah, it is.
Yep.
Field notes.
You got your field notes there.
That gets me every single time I receive a marketing email from them.
Every single time that email comes in, I think it's a Felds notes email.
And it's not, it's field notes.
I'm like, when did Martin start selling fucking little tiny notebooks?
I know, it drives me crazy.
And then I'm like, oh, the design on this email is too well designed.
It couldn't possibly be from Martin.
Somebody needs to change their whole brand, either Feldnotes or Fieldnotes.
Somebody's got to change.
I'm going with Feldnotes.
I like Feldnotes more.
I think Feldnotes.
Feldnotes wins.
I agree.
I agree.
But yeah, what has changed, Jason, is the actual device.
I was telling Martin, listeners will have already heard this, but you should probably
hear it as well.
The iMac recording studio is back.
We are now, I'm talking to you right now from the Intel iMac and I'm loving it.
That explains the delay.
So many USB ports.
It's lovely.
Love it.
It's so good.
I've got my stream deck back.
I can hear those Intel fans, that harmonic from the Intel fans.
I can hear it.
It's nice.
I love this computer.
We got the birds on Martin's side and we got the Intel fans on your side.
It's great.
I also have a really noisy share tea over here.
- Yeah, I saw that.
I'm happy that you have share tea.
That's good.
What'd you get today?
- I've got the frozen mango and passion fruit
with lychee popping pearls.
- Oh, lovely.
- Full on, Andrew looks disgusted.
- I gave you two thumbs up.
- Not a big fan of the old bubble tea.
I never know what to order.
Don't know what I like.
- I can help you with that. - Too confusing.
Too many options. - I'll help you.
- I don't do- - I'll help you.
I don't do any food where there's options. So I don't do Subway.
I don't do any food where there's options. Isn't that all food?
I don't do those Chinese foods where like, you know, lunchtime,
I don't know if Jason has these.
Those Chinese foods? What are they?
You know, the Chinese foods where you go up and you can like that.
And that they've, it's like in a food court.
Oh, and they have all the vats.
And they have like a little bain marie kind of things. And you're like,
I'll have a bit of that and a bit of that and a bit. If I ever go to one of those, I'm just saying large combination.
Because I don't want to make the choices and have to think about what I want.
You don't go for a bucket of Mongolian beef or something?
No, it's just combo.
When we go to meals in WA at some point, this is going to be quite the day.
I can't wait.
Just take him to a restaurant that has a menu and that'll obviously.
That's okay. A restaurant with a menu is fine because you have time.
You can sit and peruse and think.
No.
But if you're in a fast food queue, like Subway, they're like, what bread do you want?
Well, I don't know.
What bread do you have?
I don't know every single Subway bread off the top of my head.
I don't go there often enough to know that.
Paralysis of choice.
And then, but then they're like, okay, what cheese?
I'm like, cheese?
Now I've got to choose cheese?
I don't know, yellow cheese.
Just give me cheese.
There's so many cheeses and I'm like, I don't know what cheese.
What do I say? Cheddar? I don't know.
That's the only cheese I know off the top of my head.
You want Swiss.
The anxiety is building every single time.
And then they're like, what meat do you?
I don't know.
How do you feel about a pepper jack?
Pepper jack?
I don't know what a pepper jack is.
Maybe we have a different name for it.
What is that?
That could be. It's like a so it's a jack cheese, but it has like pepper like in it.
Not like a black pepper like a like a green pepper in it kind of mixed in.
I think it's like it's not spicy but it's got like a little yeah little specials as to it that's good you probably have a special name for it.
Yeah I don't know I just get a wanger or something I just asked for cheese I did I did find out once the subway apparently you can order English cheese.
I don't even know English cheeses but they have it so now I just say English because it's the first thing I remember.
I bet Rob knows what that is.
He would.
He would.
Have you ever tried to awkwardly shake the hand of a sandwich artist?
So before we lose this and move on to something else just Jason, what is your bubble tea or share tea? Pick your brand kind of what's your go-to flavor or combination?
I love I love a jasmine milk tea that's my preferred choice with boba.
Standard boba light on the sweet cuz generally they over sweeten.
Is that like fat variety is that a fat.
Yeah but it's tiny boba fets they put inside the tea.
I need suck him up through the straw.
Okay and this is cold milky tea.
It's cold right?
Yeah that's correct.
That's disgusting.
Why would you want cold milky tea?
At least I would get, I think Martin's closer to the actual fact because he's got no milk in his, it's just like a fruit based tea.
I think I understand what he's doing there but he's got those little pearlescent things in them that suck up through the straw.
But at least now that you've heard two alternatives next time you're presented with maybe ordering your go Jason said this maybe I'll incorporate a bit of that.
Could each of you put okay I could each of you please put your preferred tea option into the free form so next time I will go to a tea place.
I would love to expand your horizons.
I will go and I'll load up the free form and I will literally just order.
Here's your horizon right now and I feel like I want to just really open that up is what I think I want to do my horizons.
Don't like being open to know I know but I feel like it's my duty to.
To do that so we're we're gonna make that happen.
Okay put in free form I'll do it I'll do I record it I put it on the YouTube.
I don't tease with explored peaches and eggplants I feel like Jason you've got a lot of stuff in here that we need to address and do I.
Yeah what we got.
Well I mean you're sitting on something you want to mention but then you've also been doing some cleaning at high pressure so I don't know take your pick.
Oh, I should probably open the note. Let me see here. Oh my goodness.
[Music]
Oh yeah, new chair for my butt. I got a new chair for my butt. Great chair.
Not really a lot to say about it other than that it's great. It was an annoying process,
I will say. I was looking at these chairs on the internet. You can't tell what a chair feels like
Like on the internet, I don't know if you both know that or not, but can't do it.
The technology is not there.
So how do you do it?
You have to go to a physical store.
Ugh, groan the worst, right?
So I don't know if you all have stores like this, but here in the US of A, we have these
furniture stores that are,
I would describe them as super pretentious and annoying,
where you walk in and immediately they're like,
"Hi, how are you?
"I would like to take $50,000 from you."
Just with no questions asked. - Sounds like the money.
- Yeah, and you're like, "Okay, well maybe let's,
"hold on, let me look around a little bit
"and see what you have."
I don't need to redesign my whole goddamn house right now.
Like I'm just here.
'Cause when I was looking at the chair,
so I should probably name the chair.
It is the Herman Miller--
- Oh, that's expensive.
- Embody Gaming Chair, I think is the name.
I don't know, look in the notes, it'll be in there.
In amethyst is the color, beautiful purple color.
But they say, "Hey, find a place to go look at this chair."
And I go, "Great, click.
find this overly pretentious asshole store.
I go there, we walk in,
and I immediately know that I hate the place.
And I bypass, I skate right around all the people
that work there, 'cause I don't wanna talk to them,
go up to the top floor to where the chairs are
so I can figure out what's this chair?
Does it fit my life?
Does it fit my ass?
What is this chair?
You wanna sit in a chair before you spend
a significant amount of money on a chair.
So I go in there, I sit in it, I'm kinda doing the,
you know, this way, that way,
doing all the buttons, figuring it out.
Love it, love this chair, it's great.
So the website directly from them, 20% off sale.
Love that, you love a canyon.blog/save,
20% off sale on a chair, right?
So love the chair, left because the website,
20% off, free shipping.
The store, not 20% off, not free shipping.
Where am I gonna go?
Not the store.
So we leave.
So I order the chair and it comes.
Well, actually, no.
I order the chair and there's no free shipping.
I'm like, what the hell?
Where's my free shipping?
And I check and I check and I get into a chat
with the website and then the whole back and forth.
Turns out I got the free shipping, so we're good.
But anyway, chair comes in a gigantic box.
It comes fully assembled.
So this box is insanely large in terms of a box.
So the FedEx person came, hooked it on the thing,
and then like bailed without even telling anybody
'cause they didn't wanna deal with us.
So chair came, it's great.
I'm sitting in it now.
I really like it.
It's very comfortable.
It has a very unique back
in that it is like a weird skeleton thing,
which you can kind of see in the photos.
So it like, I don't know, it's just, it's really nice.
And I really like it.
And being that I sit in a chair all day, every day for work,
seems like having a proper chair
is probably a pretty good idea.
So new chair, love it.
It's great.
I like it.
My back likes it.
My butt likes it.
My legs like it.
And my arms like it.
So, new chair.
- Looks pretty cool.
And those notch things in it,
I don't know if this is what you meant
by skeletal or whatever,
but it's like each of them would line up with vertebrae.
Is that kind of what you mean?
- And you can like, it like,
kind of just like forms to your back.
It's really interesting.
It's a very cool chair.
I really like it.
- It looks like it belongs on the bridge
of the USS something or other or whatever.
- I think it's no longer on sale, unfortunately.
So sorry, but I'm sure it'll go on sale again.
- Just wanna say, Jason,
I don't know quite how it works over there in the US of A,
but you may wanna think about that being an asset
that you can depreciate when you submit your tax return.
- I'm not really interested in that.
- Okay, no worries.
- Well, I guess technically,
let me see if this makes you feel better.
So the process was I found the chair, I bought the chair,
and I did literally nothing else.
- Can you at least save the receipt into Dev and Think?
- No.
- Can I make a suggestion here?
We're about three years into this podcast
and this kind of discussion comes up pretty regularly.
Andrew, why don't you just become Jason's accountant?
- It would be helpful actually.
- That would be a disaster.
- It would be.
talking about tracking and budgeting things and tax returns and stuff Jason
within reason likes to spend money and you know get things that are of high
quality Andrew you like to track spend money so why not just bring those two
passions together you imagine getting me for receipts
is I'm the one who's always talking about you know fiscal responsibility and
you know you're making sure you're you're wealthy it's me that can't afford
to buy fast internet and a new computer so I'm still using Intel. Meanwhile Jason's
obviously just like so loaded that he's buying chairs and computers and phones.
I need a chair though it's it's for my butt. If it's all day it needs to be
economically sound doesn't it? It doesn't destroy your back. It's part of my home
office I'm gonna write it off as a business expense. There you go that's
what I want to hear just like a beautiful moment you two see how you
came together just then yeah I'm writing everything off new car write it off new
chair write it off everything so when you say you're writing off a car we're
talking about financially not destroying it right yeah financially writing it off
good as in a tax break yeah you didn't go fast and furious with the Rivian no
No, fortunately not.
So yeah, new chair.
Love it.
It's great.
That's all I have to say.
You're also looking for another new chair, but it's actually called a seat.
Oh, the bike?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm looking for a bike.
I am.
So I bought a treadmill last December, and I've been using it very regularly.
It's been great.
But I need like an alternate thing for exercise.
'Cause like just running all the time
gets to be pretty like, okay, I get it.
Like I'm kind of done with this right now.
Sorry, Eric, with your insanity that is yourself,
but some of us can't just run 700 miles a day
and still be happy.
So like I need an alternate activity.
- And then Robert would he just walks with his name?
I don't know.
- If he would walk once, it would be amazing.
He's incapable of walking.
It's insane.
Um, so I'm thinking biking would be like a alternative to running.
So now I'm looking at bikes and I'm looking for recommendations from folks.
Uh, I think I've landed on, I believe there is a new category
of bike called a gravel bike.
I think biking at some point must've hit like a plateau of sales.
So they created a new category to try to do more sales.
So that's what I think I'm looking for.
I'm currently looking at a Trek bike, but I'm looking for feedback.
That would be hello@hemisphericfuse.com, keyword bike.
And if you have some recommendations, I would love to hear them.
I have a query around nomenclature.
Can you call it biking?
You don't call it cycling?
I would call it biking.
Yes.
It's cycling.
Well, it's a bike, so it's biking.
It's a bike, so it's cycling.
All right. So, Andrew, are you equally upset about the importing of the American term
hiking into a country where we normally say bushwalking?
Yes.
OK. So it's just another example of that.
We don't bushwalk because we don't have bush.
There you go. You take a hike.
We hike because we have hikes.
If we had bush, we would bushwalk.
Can we bush bash?
I'm into that that sounds great.
Also Trek Trek by good choice brand.
No the bike I still currently own is a Trek I own a Trek I bought it many years ago it's done well it's pretty much end of life I almost bought a new bike last year when I was into biking or cycling.
And then I didn't.
So but I'm I endorse the cycling lifestyle the thing that put me off cycling Jason just be aware of it I don't know what your terrain is like.
Perth is generally fairly flat which is great unfortunately I seem to live in a suburb which has all the hills.
So for me to just get started I'm like if I want to go left I'm up a hill on your right I'm up a hill.
And it put me right off because I knew every time I went out the door first thing was a hill.
Sucked not many hills here for the most part it would be mostly street and then some light trail when we go camping.
to be able to kind of go through the trails.
So that's why I'm thinking this gravel thing
is the right choice for me,
'cause it's kind of a hybrid trail/road thing.
But yeah, if anybody's got suggestions, let me know.
Turns out too, bikes, what a price range bikes can have.
Holy shit.
You can go from like $300 to like $30,000,
and they basically look the same.
So that's interesting.
- Would you get an e-bike?
- I thought about it,
but I think I just kind of want it like a regular one.
I think.
I'm not sure though.
I'm open to everything at this point.
If I can have an e-bike that lets me be a normal bike
and then e-bike when I want,
that I think I would be interested in.
- I think that's how they work, isn't it?
- Yeah. - I have no idea.
- I don't bring it up from any position of expertise.
I only bring it up because my manager, Craig,
also listener of this show. - Hi, Craig.
- Hi, Craig.
He occasionally rides an e-bike to work and he loves it
'cause he has that kind of flexibility.
So he can push along when he needs to get there,
but it's still an exercise tool.
- Yeah.
Oh, I'm totally down for it.
Yeah, if that's like where I could go all out
and then I'm like, I'm tired as hell,
I can't even make it back and then e-bike back,
that would be great.
I'm all about that.
We should probably all get e-bikes.
- I found that when you find the ones
that are the coolest colors,
those tend to be the most expensive ones.
'Cause like, I found like a very boring gray one
and it was like, oh, this is like $1,000.
I was like, okay.
I was like, ooh, what's this like cool green and yellow one?
Oh, that's $12,000.
I'm like, okay, maybe I don't need that one.
- Just get the yellow and blue one.
- Yeah, if I could find one, oh man, can you imagine?
Custom painted HV bike?
I would be all about that.
- You can put the little like Trek,
the Trek logo is almost like a little shield.
You can basically just rip that off
and put the HV shield on in the front of it instead.
- I might have to do that.
Well, I will do that.
Don't worry.
Pressure washer.
I initially was researching pressure washers
and then while I was researching them in this note,
I actually ended up buying one instead.
So that's done.
- Congratulations.
Yeah. Okay. Andrew, can you add that to Jason's depreciation spreadsheet, please?
Yeah, I will. We're at 49 minutes already.
So chop chop. Was it a Karcher?
It's a brand. Your pressure washer was a Karcher.
Karcher. No.
Karcher. No, it wasn't.
It was a DeWalt.
That's great that you got a DeWalt.
Really good job, Martin. You just did it again.
That's why I did it.
What did he do?
A proper Australian would just say, "Ka-cha". "De-ka-cha mate".
Martin of course, Martin of course says, "Well,
actually it is a German brand and therefore we pronounce it in the German
way, which according to my knowledge and my family expertise,
because I am a little bit German, I am ze German.
We must pronounce it as de-ka-cha or whatever it was you said.
There is some serious shit that went down before I got here clearly.
There was yeah but it was good.
So just for documenting the correctness it's not Karcher it's.
Kircher.
Thank you.
Wow those are very different.
To be fair though I know that there'll be all these Germans out there who will just school me on the way I said it as an Australian so I can't even claim that it would be totally correct.
And on top of that, I think this is a good example of the whole like persona and podcasting thing.
Because if we had been just talking in person, I wouldn't have done that, Andrew.
It doesn't even matter.
I'll let it slide.
But when we're in this little trio here, we got a little Zoom windows happening.
It's like performative central.
I can't resist.
So, damn it.
I just walked into my own trap.
So do you say Dewalt or is it De-Vault?
I would probably say it like a wanker and say De-Vault or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like I can't help but say Volkswagen rather than Volkswagen.
I just can't.
Well, that's the one I got. So there you go.
How do you say Braun?
Like the shaver? Braun.
OK.
Braun. What else is there?
What else is German?
People say Schwarzkopf.
It's Schwarzkopf.
OK.
People say Aldi or Aldi.
But I don't walk around like that because that would just be too bizarre.
I'm like, oh, where'd you go shopping?
I went to Aldi. I'm not going to say that.
I'll just say Aldi.
Where's I said I went to Aldi.
Aldi.
Yeah.
Aldi.
Not to mention most people don't know and I'm pretty sure this is still or this is the case the Aldi that everyone goes to internationally is like the southern version.
There's like two Aldi's in Germany.
I think it was the result of some family disagreement or the company split kind of like is it Sabian and Zildjian the symbol company.
So the Aldi that we know internationally is Aldi suit, which is southern Aldi.
I think that's right.
I think I'm a Adidas I think it added a some Puma didn't I split people say Adidas then I get a little bit okay that's not that's not right it's Adidas.
I did not like Adidas look correct.
Well it's like Australian say Nikon and American say Nikon and somehow we're all still friends.
That annoys me every time and now we're right back with looped all the way around to podcast world and now we have to talk about how we say hover.
It is Nick on that's the correct it's Nick on the only American who says it correctly but how do you say hover.
Like the play in what was the main what a helicopter does all the domain names oh I say pork bun.
Join us next fortnight for episode 094.
In this exciting tech adjacent podcast where we may speak about technology we may not what we will certainly speak about will be.
A desk and a banana.
See you next time on Hemispheric Confluence.
I guess since I counted as in I should count as out.
Yeah.
Expected more resistance.
Okay.
Three.
In three, two, one.
Stop.
