[MUSIC]
It sounds so good with this microphone,
even better than the other one.
Just imagine how good you'd sound if you were recording inside your Rivian.
I would sound probably worse,
Because that'd be on my iPhone.
Actually, the back mics, the back mic on the phone, because you know, you can use that whole
continuity camera thing. That sounds really good up against your mouth.
Just that little tiny pinhole thing on the back?
Yeah, I tried it with continuity camera or whatever, and like recorded with QuickTime as
like an input with the iPhone. And I was genuinely surprised. I thought it was podcast worthy.
Wow, well they are studio quality I've heard so.
Apparently so. I'm not happy ever talking about iPhones guys.
Why?
Well you know, I was just talking to Jason before the show about the story of my iPhone.
Yeah I don't think anyone else knows though.
Okay.
So what did you order?
I ordered the iPhone 15 Pro and my shipping updates are coming through.
But they're not coming through reliably.
So according to Shipper Star Trek, a subsidiary company now of Australia Post, Apple, you
need to reconsider your contracting.
You used to use TNT and everything went beautifully.
I think it was TNT, wasn't it?
It was one of the yellow ones.
Maybe it was DHL.
I don't know.
But it worked reliably every time.
Now we've got Star Trek, Australia Post, well say no more.
Soon as Australia Post gets involved in the postal logistics things go wrong
The shipping said it was going to be it said it was at Perth Airport and stayed that way for like three days
So I phoned them and they said I will lodge an investigation
Will give us 24 hours
Gave him 24 hours hadn't heard back. I find them again and they said oh, let's just have a look at that
Shipping information that I can see still says it's at Perth Airport. Let me click around they click around
Oh, that's actually a big relate distribution center. I'll send them. I'll send them a note. I'll send the manager a note
It's like excellent. Okay a note. I'm sure that'll cut right through the bureaucracy. I
Said how long might it take until I hear back from your note and the answer I got was
How long is a piece of string they said that now when you've got?
$2,000 iPhone
Out there in the either
That's not the answer you're looking for. I do not know how what to do now. So do I just keep waiting and
Hope that it gets found at some point
Did you go to spotlight to see how long a piece of string was just to have an idea?
Hold on real time. Let me check. Let me check the truth machine
How long is a?
A piece of string question mark.
The length of a piece of string can vary and depends on how much string is
available.
I reckon they've got a lot of string. Yeah. I don't know what to do.
So it's just in this limbo land. I can't, Jason,
you're suggesting I cancel my order, but I don't know how. Yeah.
I've got a refund.
So I've got 14 days to return my old one to get my refund.
So that clock's ticking.
So I'm a little bit nervous.
Is that from the date of order or from the date of receipt?
I don't know.
I need to figure that out.
But, um,
I do think it's kind of funny that you called them about them not being able to
deliver something.
And then they told you the answer was that they were going to deliver another
piece of information, which is this note to someone.
What's the confidence level that that note's going to get there?
Not extraordinarily low.
Yeah.
And so I tried calling, I tried using the Apple callers and discuss cause I was like,
ah, what the heck?
You know, they won't know because they'll, if they have any information, they'll only have the information I have, but I called them and you don't talk to a person.
You talk to a computer that says, I'm a computer, but I sound like a person.
Ask me a question.
And so you ask the Apple bot a question.
It waits for a minute.
And then you just hear this keyboard clicking sound effect.
Thank you for your inquiry.
We can send you a link via SMS to your phone
so that you can track the status of your order.
I know the status of my order.
The status of my order is wrong.
What do I do now?
How do I cancel this order or start over?
I'm flummoxed.
So probably the answer is just be patient, Andrew.
Just forget shipping tracking exists
and just trust the world.
I don't know.
It'll probably turn up Monday.
No, it won't turn up Monday.
Who am I kidding?
It'll probably turn up Friday.
- That confidence and optimism was there
for like almost a second and a half
and then immediately went away.
- So all that to say, I'm very happy, Jason,
that you have your iPhone 15.
Martin, I'm happy that you confidently have $2,000 still in your pocket.
I have neither.
Hmm.
Yeah.
I'm having a great time with my 13 mini.
It's the perfect size for my hands.
That's a bummer.
That is such a such a lame because it's like you can't it's not like whose fault is it?
It's a carrier.
Like what are you going to do?
It's so hard to do anything about that.
Yeah.
And so I had to find anybody who has authority to do anything about it.
Right.
I like that you're even twirling your USB-C cable there,
just with this great sense of anticipation.
- Yeah.
(laughing)
Yeah, I got my A to C adapter all ready to go.
Oh man. - The real tragedy
is that he already got rid of all of his lightning cables
from his house.
He went through and purged them all.
And so he has no way of charging his phone anymore.
- And wiped his phone.
It's gone. - And wiped it.
- Everything.
- Yeah, shipped it back.
He's got nothing.
That's, that sucks.
I don't, there's nothing more I can say than that is super annoying.
And Star Trek, you are zero stars.
Yeah.
Zero, absolutely zero stars.
Just check my, I just load up parcel right now, actually, just, just,
just for the latest update.
Can you give us a real time update on this?
Where are we at?
Okay.
So the 22nd of September, it was in New South Wales.
So Martin had it.
OK.
Oh shit.
It's under my desk.
I totally forgot.
Sorry, Andrew.
Let me just.
So you don't realize that everything goes through.
He has to actually pass it off to the next place.
So he just he maybe it fell in the couch cushion or something.
We don't know.
It's true.
Star Trek is run entirely by entirely by volunteers.
And I just totally forgot.
Sorry.
But it's OK.
It left.
It left New South Wales.
And on Monday, the 25th of September at 2 49 AM, it arrived at Perth airport.
And that's it.
Monday, the 25th.
It is now time of recording.
It is now the 1st of October.
So it's been somewhere in the Perth region for a week, basically.
Who knows?
I'm kind of obsessed with this, with the Xbox stuff again.
I know we've talked about that before, but Xbox cloud gaming beta, quote unquote, because
I'm sure it's just beta so they can be like, hey, it's beta just in case anything happens.
But I think Martin, you use this or have used it for sure.
I did.
I was super impressed, but I unsubscribed ages ago just because I was never in the position
to actually use it.
I had the time to do it.
You only need to get fresh tires every few years, right?
So when are you in the tire shop to play it?
- That's true.
- Exactly.
- That's true.
- So next time I have to do a car repair
or something that sees me sitting for a while.
- Resubscribe, yeah, okay, that makes sense.
- Someone at Microsoft will go,
"God, I hope Martin's car is okay."
- Feels like he's getting a lot of tires.
I just, I have an arrow pointed at it in the free form
and it says, wow, because I just,
I can't get over technically like, yeah, it,
the games are fine.
Like whatever your favorite games are, that's irrelevant.
Just the technology behind this thing.
It's just blowing my mind how incredibly good it is
and how yet again, Xbox, the, I don't know,
subsidiary of Microsoft,
whatever the business thing is there.
They just always do everything really, really, really well.
And every time we talk about anything Microsoft,
it's never anything good.
But everything Xbox is like exceptional
and this cloud gaming thing.
So, okay, I'm on my Mac, first of all.
So already you would think, oh, that's not gonna work
'cause it's a Microsoft thing.
Nope, I literally open up Safari.
So again, you'd think, oh, a Mac and Safari?
that's you can't do you can't do Microsoft things there that doesn't work.
Load up this cloud gaming thing fires up beautifully.
Uh, pick a game. I get the little rocket ship thing while it's loading.
While somebody runs down the hall and throws the game I want into an X-Box and
some data center somewhere. I suppose that's how that's probably,
that's how it works. Um, so they put the disc in,
it goes now in Safari on my Mac.
I have effectively an Xbox just running in the browser
that has a little sub menu where I can full screen it.
And I turn on a PlayStation 5 controller
connected via Bluetooth,
and it all works 1000% perfectly.
No glitching, no dropped frames,
like it looks beautiful, it works,
and it's just streaming the entire thing to my desktop.
- What game are you playing?
- There's a couple of them that I've been playing lately.
Starfield, which is the new one.
Xbox Game Pass, again.
Game Pass also the best possible subscription
in the entire world, in the world of subscriptions,
because it's just in there.
You go, oh, that's a cool game.
I should go look at, oh, it's in Game Pass.
Okay, cool, I just have it already.
Like, it's amazing.
So Starfield and Sea of Stars.
A lot of stars going on here to go with the Star Trek.
Yes, yes, that's the water version.
- That's not the pirate version, that's Sea of Thieves.
- That's Sea of Thieves, yeah, which also Game Pass.
So yeah, you can play that.
There's so many games on Game Pass,
but this cloud thing, if you haven't tried it
or you've ever thought you wanted to maybe play,
you didn't want to get a console,
You kind of almost don't need a console when it comes to this cloud gaming thing.
Well, I tried that before buying it. I was doing it just through the iPad.
Oh, there you go. It's almost like a trial of a console. That's pretty cool.
Martin, does it even work okay on Australian internet? I mean, Jason, with his
gigabit both way situation, totally fine. Okay.
But even us.
I was doing it in a tire shop.
True, true.
On my phone.
On a phone.
not 5G or something, just normal, whatever.
- Yeah, so I can start a game on my Mac.
I can then continue it on my iPad,
then move it to my phone,
then move it to like the ROG Ally.
It just goes to all the devices seamlessly.
It's freaking great.
If you're-
- I think the difference is in Australia,
you can just run like the cloud gaming thing
without a hitch. But in America, with Jason's particular system, he could do that multiple
times over and run all of Amazon's logistic systems from his study. That's the difference.
Yeah, definitely. So it's great and it's awesome and I love it. And I just like Xbox just doing
awesome stuff over there. The infrastructure that it must take to make this work has to
just be just next level engineering to make all this function for not just me, but I'm
sure thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions.
I don't even know how many people would be concurrently trying to use this, but it just
works.
So, um, 500 stars for cloud gaming would be a one-time given it a sea of stars.
I would give it yes.
- A sea of stars, yeah.
- And on the topic of sea,
let's all thank the undersea cables
that are supporting that for you.
- Indeed. - That's true, yeah.
- It's like this, Jason's given us an entire sea of stars.
It's just basically a star field.
- A star field, yeah.
Boy, this is really just circling.
- And for the price, it's basically a steal,
which makes you a thief of the sea of the stars.
- Okay. - Within the sea of thieves.
- Yeah. - Does that work?
I think I'm clutching the straws it clutching at straws now. You're clutching at stars
Okay, it's start. It's it has officially fallen off the cliff now
I think I think it is and did we mention that my somewhere my iPhone is being held ransom by Star Trek I
Think we I think we may have covered that a couple couple two three minutes ago, but okay. Yeah
All right
Xbox love them. They're great
Let's do a little contest. Do either of you know what application that icon is from?
The purple one?
Yeah.
I do.
Apple Podcasts, I think is how you pronounce it.
Okay, that's perfect.
Formally iTunes.
iTunes. Yeah, it's wherever you get your podcasts is really what that one's called. I just wanted
to bring that up because I would love it if everybody in that's hearing any of
our three voices right now, if you can just pop that thing open,
go over to the show.
There'll be a link in the show notes even really to just try to get you as
close to the metal as we can. Just grab, grab your little cursor.
Just tap on that.
The star furthest to the right is the star you're looking for.
Not the first one, not the second one.
Getting closer with the third.
Fourth is, you think four looks good,
but then you see five and you say,
ooh, that fifth one, that's the one I want.
You click that, and that's basically it.
You could, if you're like really feeling ambitious,
and you just say, you woke up today,
and you're like, ooh, I just got energy for days,
you could go into the little text box underneath.
Use your little clicky-clack keyboard,
check a couple words in there. Let other people know what's going on here and why that five stars
was, you know, the most you could give. You give 10 if you could, you'd give 20, 30, 50 stars,
but you know, the man is keeping us down to five. So five star that thing, there was some words in
there. It would be great because, um, the podcast universe is weird. And for some reason it matters
that it takes place in this one place where you may not even listen.
So download it, do that, and then get rid of it if you don't want it.
So thank you.
So basically give us a star field.
Or a sea of stars, but not a star track.
No, no, no.
That star track is what we're getting now where the reviews are not arriving.
We want the other one where they actually show up.
It would be preferred.
Yes.
That's much better.
Because there's some magic threshold that we have to hit for it to even show
what our rating is like, like above the fold, basically.
Cause if you look at other shows, it'll show like all the artwork and everything,
and it'll have a rating way up at the top. But for like,
if you don't have enough, it's just down, down at the bottom. So.
Ah, I think the technical term is "loserville". Is that what we're in?
Martin. Business, sorry, business corner. Okay.
What we'll find is that is that most things in nature and business and podcasting fall into the 80/20 rule
Otherwise known as the Pareto rule
Yeah, 80% of everything. All right, that's that's your ATP show
That's that's your talk show with John Gruber 80% then in the 20
There's something called the long tail and that's where you have
all the other people
In that down and in that 20% grabbing for that 20% of other
listenership
Now can we push hemispheric views into the 80?
Where that sweet sweet advertising revenue lives?
I actually thought we were maybe more like the 20% of the 20% of the 20% like
the
long tail. Sort of just looks like a flat line.
We're consistent.
We've done almost a hundred episodes every two weeks for a long period of time.
We should get something for that.
Every Thursday, every other Thursday rather. Yeah. So there you go.
That's weird to think about.
Thanks for business corner.
Martin, if you wanted to do more research on
the long tail and the 80/20 rule and Pareto,
You could use a search engine.
Which search engine would you use?
Is this a trick question?
No, it's a genuine honest question.
If you wanted to search it up, as my kid would say.
Dad, search it up!
Search it up? Wow.
What would you use to search it up?
If I just walked up to Safari,
either on my phone, or my Mac, or my iPad, or whatever,
it would be running, and is running, DuckDuckGo.
Backed by the Bing search engine, backed by Microsoft, gets back to Xbox.
Jason, if you were searching, and you were going to search it up.
Search it up sounds like some weird TV show from the 80s on MTV or the 90s maybe.
Like, "Search it up!"
I don't know what it would be, but that's what it sounds like.
It would be like the kid with that computer, doing the thumbs up.
it up yeah you Andrew yeah yeah all the kid I wish it was he was a legend and
whatever it was it came on like a floppy disk so like I wanted to search it up
you had to put the floppy disk in with in Carter 95 in Carter yeah oh those
videos took so long to play.
CD-ROM drive.
And like a 1X.
It was a 1X back then.
I don't even think it had Xs.
I think it just, that was the 1X.
Just CD-ROM.
And then eventually, yeah.
Sorry, Martin, that was before your time.
What was?
CD-ROMs.
I used them as a kit.
I used to put in Carter into the power Macintosh.
CD-ROMs were before your time.
I don't think so.
I really look. We've almost done 100 shows of the regular one.
Right. Yeah. This show.
Yeah. And I'm pretty sure Andrew thinks I'm like 11.
Just a really hairy 11 year old.
That's being generous.
You're just a work experience kid.
I'm not even sure he thinks you've actually been born yet.
I'm still still questioning that.
I'm just an AI generated potential future vision of some guy from Wollongong.
I'm just looking forward to the day we can turf you for the show and bring in Mac.
Thanks.
He's, that's really what we're holding out for at this point.
If you think I'm a foot, you just wait.
Oh, goodness.
Could only imagine.
Do you want to go to the park, Mac?
No.
Once we're there, do you want to go home?
No, stay park.
All right.
Damn right.
So Jason, how would you search it up?
If I was going to search it up, my first choice
would probably be AOL keywords.
But if I didn't have access to those,
I would probably use this thing that I think people
are chatting about these days.
I've been trialing it out.
Is it Kaggy?
Coggy?
Kaggy?
I don't know, really.
Kegi, I think.
- Kagi?
- Kagi?
- Is that what your mouth is after you have too much milk?
You have it in the water?
- I don't know.
I'm not sure.
It's K-A-G-I.
- I think it's Kagi.
There is somewhere on their website where they pronounce it,
but I've forgotten what they say now.
- Okay.
- Kagi?
- Well, it's some new thing.
Well, actually it's not even really that new.
It's been around for a while.
I remember trying it.
When did, we tried it a long time ago.
- We did.
six months ago, a year ago. Probably a year ago. Yeah. It was just sort of like,
this isn't, I don't really understand why I would use this,
but I've been using it lately. Uh, and it's been, it's been good.
It finds me what I want to find. Usually it's got a lot of,
uh,
like specificity around certain things that you can search specifically
podcasts and it will do podcast search, which is pretty cool.
or they have a thing called like lenses where you can look, you can do a search through a lens of
I'm doing research around this or it just sort of like shifts the way that you're looking at
the results on the internet. It's, oh, I hold on so I can make sure get everybody mad. It's a paid
product. Oh no, paid search. God, that's the worst. How could you? But it's $10 for unlimited
searches, which it didn't used to be. It was like $10 for like some limited number.
Yeah, and it's $5 for 300.
I was blowing through that. I was like, well, this is not going to work because just doing
show notes alone, I do like hundreds of searches just for that.
Although Jason, they have just announced they've gone to $10 for unlimited searches.
Yes. Right. Right. So I'm still using it. I think I've been using it for a couple of weeks,
maybe a month. I'm still not convinced that it's doing me any better than DuckDuckGo,
which is what I had used for the last 100 million years. So we'll see. I like the premise of it. I
like the customization of it. You can change a lot of the visually how the search results work.
You can make it your default thing and kind of hacky,
I think it's not great.
You know, if you go into Safari and say,
what search engine do I want?
Sure, it's not there, but you can use like an extension
and it mostly works.
You can do it on your phone as well.
So it's pretty seamless.
I don't think it's perfect.
I'd much rather it be in that selection box.
So when I type in that top bar,
I still get DuckDuckGo sometimes.
like randomly and I don't know why.
I think just because it is kind of a hack.
But all of that aside, as a search engine,
I think it's very good.
But that being said, if you look at DuckDuckGo
from a free standpoint, 'cause that's the bar,
the bar is free, right?
Like there's a million search engines, you know,
capital G is in the room, everybody knows about that.
So if I look at DuckDuckGo as free,
and this as $10 a month, $10 a month,
not $10 a year, $10 a month.
Let's, you know, Setapp is like, what,
$15 a month or something, so.
10 bucks is pretty pricey, and pretty, you know,
I think that prices out a lot of people,
regardless of how good it is.
But anyways, DuckDuckGo versus this,
I have still not hit that point where I'm like,
this is definitely $10 a month better than DuckDuckGo.
Personally, I've not hit that, but it's very good.
I do like it.
Did I sell you on it?
- Yeah, look, I've been using it too.
- Oh, see, look, I pre-sold you on it.
You're already there.
- I think I told you about it.
You know, I don't wanna brag or anything.
- You did. (laughs)
- I haven't used it, and I think I totally forgot
that it was ever discussed on this show, if it was.
So, thanks for telling me again.
- Well, look, it's the one thing that holds me back
from really leaning in and buying a bunch of credits
and all that, nothing to do with the company,
everything to do with the exchange rate.
Once again, we have a product that is priced in US dollars
and like $10 US per month might be totally reasonable,
might sound reasonable in the US,
But in Australia, that becomes like $18 at the moment,
let's say, Martin, 15 maybe.
Like that's for a month of search.
Like that's a lot of money.
And it's not their fault.
It's just the exchange rate.
But everything is denominated in US dollars
and it really hurts.
And in Australia, it's hurting more and more.
- What about those poor New Zealanders?
What's going on over there?
Yeah, that must be absolutely disastrous.
So really it's.
Well, as in our dollar is generally stronger than theirs is, so their exchange rate.
So it's even worse.
It's even worse.
Yeah.
And so it's just difficult to find that amount of money to put towards a search engine,
given you know that you're going to get screwed by the exchange rate.
So and you'll pay bank fees on top of that, just as a further annoyance.
It's just, all these products are all suffering the same problem here in the Southern Hemisphere.
So just put that out there, since we are hemispheric views, it's just become more and more noticeable that as our exchange rate has fluctuated, these things get more expensive.
So I'm really having to be selective with my subscriptions.
I wonder how many users there are out of, I don't know, Fiji or Vanuatu or New Caledonia.
Any listeners from out there who have been suffering the Cargi or Kagi or Kagi or whatever the hell it is exchange right right into Andrew specifically and
Wouldn't it be great if there was a global currency that could resolve this problem
Oh God
No
What would you call it Andrew? What would you call it?
something like
Satoshi
Would it be paper money or would you make it like fun like coins?
And then I'm I thought Satoshi, but then that sounds like you're talking like a Japanese currency
Rather than a global currency. So I was thinking maybe something like
bit note
Bit note. Mm-hmm because it's computer II and then like a dollar notes, you know, but we don't but then a show that doesn't have dollar notes
So we don't know what that means
Do you have dollar coins? We we do we do. Oh, so could you just could you just swap out note for coin? Maybe?
- Ah, Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin, that could be a thing.
- That could work.
- Yeah, it has a good ring to it.
- Could we consume oodles of carbon polluting energy
to create said Bitcoin?
- I think so.
- I think if we put it through like a superfluous algorithm
of some kind in like a really overly complicated
ledger system or something,
we could probably make it use a lot of fossil fuel.
Is there any way that I could get just gloriously rich through some sort of Bitcoin Ponzi scheme?
Probably you won't, but many others will.
Yeah, so.
Well, then I could afford my Kege search, potentially.
You could, yeah.
And you could buy Star Trek and find your phone.
Just shut them down and say, everything stops until this phone is found, okay?
No one's going home until this phone is put on my desk right now.
I'll walk into Star Trek and I'll say, "Let that sink in."
You know what I've just realized after three years of doing this show with you two?
Jason, I feel like this podcast is really just a kind of business therapy for Andrew.
Well, there's a million ideas a minute coming out of it here.
So eventually one of them's going to stick.
I don't say that negatively. I think it's great if we're here to help you, you know,
navigate logistics, postage, exchange rates. That's what the listeners are here for too.
Can we talk about your disastrous exchange rate for a minute? I am actually genuinely
curious about parts of it. Because we always, whenever like, you know, iPhone time comes
out. There aren't a lot of things, I shall say, that the three of us are all buying the same
thing, right? Like an iPhone would be one of those, but very few other things are in that category.
So what other stuff are you getting screwed on outside of like technology stuff?
Petrol? $2.20 a liter or something?
$20/$30?
230 a liter.
220 to 230.
It's been around here.
Wow.
Okay.
That's tax-inclusive.
Well, that helps.
Does it?
But I don't know, because you buy in gallons.
So.
Yeah, it's a whole math thing.
That's probably like 50 gallons.
I don't know.
We hit because I like Earth those three years ago when we would talk about new iPhone time
it would be like if it was a thousand dollars here, it would be like
1100 or 1200 there. Mm-hmm. And now flash forward to now I feel like if it's
1000 now it's like
2000 there it feels like it's everything's double now, which is just crazy. Have we had a look? What are the actual?
numbers now like if you have a squiz jason and uh andrew and i can have a look at pricing what am i
squeezing max out the most expensive new iphone and see what the uh the number is okay okay and
you're going with a 15 pro max 15 pro max whatever color because that doesn't really change anything
one terabyte this is just martin rubbing it in that i did this and it's in the ether by
I didn't mean it that way but yeah cool in Australian dollars it's $2,899 for a one terabyte
iPhone 15 pro max. Okay now let me punch that into the currency conversion.
Oh $15.99. Okay now add tax on top you pay tax don't you? I don't.
Which is you just just a choice you made Jason or a political.
No we don't have sales tax in my state.
Wow.
So $15.99 is what I pay whatever it says on the thing that's what that's what comes out of my pocket.
Right Andrew crunch the numbers.
Okay so I've crunched the numbers $2,899 Australian dollars would be equivalent to us paying $1,863 US dollars.
So 200 and change.
Surcharge.
Yeah.
Okay.
So yeah, it's expensive.
Yeah.
With the added element that you don't actually get it once you've paid for it.
Just giving Apple money.
Now that is a margin.
100% margins.
Wonderful.
It's a great experience.
You know, Tim, my customer sat is very low.
This blow away new device you've got.
I wouldn't know about it because it's lost by Star Trek.
- Andrew, he doesn't hear you unless you use your prayer hands.
- I'm going to write one of those letters.
I'm going to say, "Dear Tim," and I'll be at the front of the keynote next year.
"Dear Tim, I heard that your iPhone was amazing, so I purchased one and it never turned up."
- And that's it. That's the whole thing.
- There's a kid in Bibra Lake who's very happy with your phone right now, Andrew.
Don't get too upset.
I feel this is how they've gotten their 2030 global shipping climate change initiative sorted out. They literally don't ship
Man, your carbon emissions are way down because they they make the phone
They warehouse the phone they receive your money and that's the end of it
Supply chain efficiency Tim Cookian. We know he's a supply chain guru. He's worked it out. It's like why are we even delivering these phones?
Let's just park them up in a warehouse
Well, fortunately for you my phone is big enough for both of us, so we're I got you covered if you need any
Thing seried or you need some thumb typing done. Just let me know
And why I'll source it to why what have you got the biggest phone known to man?
the 15 Pro Max
The 5x zoom 5x zoom yeah
Tetraprism.
- Tetraprism.
Wow.
- Don't you wish you could see it?
God, I wanna see it.
I just wanna see what it looks like.
It's gotta be super small, but it's still, I wanna see one.
- Are you enjoying it?
- It's phenomenal.
I love it.
It's absolutely great.
It's the natural titanium.
I love it.
It weighs very little, surprisingly,
for how gigantic it is.
The edges are lovely.
- Has it overheated, burnt a hole in your pocket?
- No, no, it has not.
I've been hearing about this for like three days now.
And in basically typical fashion,
every time there's something that happens
that is this big, oh my gosh,
all these things are happening.
I'm always sitting over here like mine is fine.
What is going on?
Why I just have like the best luck in the world, I guess.
I don't know.
- As opposed to me, who has the worst.
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, yours, I mean, yours isn't overheating either
that you know of.
- Did you get a fine woven case?
- I don't do cases.
No, but I did go to the Apple store today to look at them
because yet this was another,
oh my God, the world's on fire on the internet.
Jeez, everything's the worst.
So I had to go look at them for myself
because I'm sick of hearing about it.
And like, I don't know, they're cases.
I'm not a case person.
I don't, I wouldn't get one 'cause I don't get cases.
So I don't know if that really says anything.
- Did you take a bowl of spaghetti bolognese with you
just to drop on the back
or maybe rub a meat pie into it or something?
- Oh my God, yeah.
So what I did was I picked it up.
- Drop some Coca-Cola on it.
- Gently like looked at it
and then I took a screwdriver
and stabbed it through the back and said,
oh my God, this is trash.
And then I said, "Like and subscribe!"
Yeah, no, it's fine.
You could tell that people are going to the stores and deliberately screwing them up,
which I think is super douchey and annoying.
Quit being a dick.
We don't need more.
We have so many dicks in this world already.
The last thing we need is another one.
If you don't like it, don't buy it.
End of story.
I don't know why this is such a big deal,
but anyway, they're fine.
They feel really weird.
They feel like really smooth.
I was expecting to be able to see the little weavy,
in my head, I envisioned it to be like the Apple Watch bands
that are like that kind of Velcro-y, like squishy stuff.
I thought it was gonna be like that,
so it'd be like a little pillow,
but you can't see the weave at all.
Like it's just flat.
And it feels like a suede, I would say.
If, yeah, like a suede is kind of the feeling.
- Suede gives me shivers, so I'm not touching that.
- Yeah, where it's sort of like one direction
and like you can kind of feel like a different direction.
It's, yeah, it's weird.
- I can't leave that alone.
What's wrong with suede, Martin?
- There's something about the feel of it.
That's just like, I don't know.
It's like the touch equivalent of when you hear
something scraping on an old chalkboard or something.
I don't know.
makes your hands feel dry and odd. Maybe that's just me. But I'm also someone who sneezes in
direct sunlight, which is a thing. - Oh, I do that too.
- Oh, you're one of those people. - I'm one of those too.
- Yeah. - Okay.
- Oh, very good. - The rubber case colors are very nice.
I can say that. Those are very pretty. The rubber, whatever they're, I don't know,
are those floral elastomer? I have no idea what they're made of, but they look very nice.
- Sorry, we're not talking about that anymore, Jason. We're talking about sneezes.
- Oh, okay. Sorry. Moving on. - What's the
- That's when you sneeze on your fine woven case.
That's what I want to know.
- I bet it's fine.
Like most things that are overblown,
I bet it's probably fine.
- Oh, I have a question.
Now that you have your 15 Pro Max,
does it feel like it's actually seriously close in size
to your, sorry, does it actually feel like
it's seriously close in size to your M2 iPad,
which you've listed here in the free form?
- No.
- Like do you feel this size gap closing?
No, but what I did do is replace my old phone
and my iPad mini with my 15 Pro Max.
So I am down to the proper amount of devices now
that I don't feel like I'm going insane.
So I have one computer, one iPad, one phone, that's it.
- Perfect, and one camera, 'cause you've done that too.
Yes, in one cam, yeah, I'm downsizing everything.
I just want one of everything.
I wanna simplify what's going on.
And it's been working great as like,
fitting that iPad mini kinda middle size.
Like it's not quite there, but it's pretty damn good.
And the fact that it's like, got the OLED
and the ProMotion and all that feels really good.
I can't pencil on it.
I don't know. I still don't know why that's not a thing.
It feels like it should be.
But if you've got a stylus, you blew it.
Oh, that's true.
That's true. Yeah.
So this one of everything is this extending to like one pair of shoes, one pair of
underwear. You're like, really?
Just no, no, it's not gotten that bad yet.
I mean, eventually maybe we might get there.
We'll see. All right.
Just wash them every day.
Well, you know, every few, every few days.
Hey Siri, set a reminder to wash my underwear.
You don't need to say, Hey anymore.
A little quick tip for your new iPhone and Martin, this will
even work on an iPhone 13 mini.
I know because I tried.
Courtesy of a retweet from friend of the show, Firstenberg, AKA Firsty.
Go to settings, accessibility, touch.
haptic touch and then set it to fast it is so much better.
Firsty, thank you for retuning that on Mastodon. I made that change and I much
prefer it. Yeah that's nice. It makes all the like tap and hold functions way
quicker and it feels a bit like 3d touch again how that used to be. Maybe that was
thing. If you want to check out one prime plus.com where it's always in the game, the long game,
we put out a pretty weird episode recently, just a mini about big banana. Andrew had suspicions,
conspiracy theories, and there was some creepiness. We actually had a one prime plus
hemispherian say in the discord that he wasn't sure how he would sleep that night. And I'm proud
That's basically a 5 star review.
