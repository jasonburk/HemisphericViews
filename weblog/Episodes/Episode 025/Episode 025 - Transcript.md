On this week's special Easter episode of Hemispheric Views,
we're talking about technology fatigue, Johnny Decimal, and not forgetting Media Corner.
All that ahead.
Is that the first time that we've had a full introduction like contents at the beginning
of an episode?
Audio contents?
I believe so, yeah.
I think so.
We're getting good at this.
And no one can see that Andrew's wearing Christmas pajamas on Easter.
I didn't have any Easter pajamas so I had to wear something.
So Christmas is- they're the nice ones with the little button up.
The collar, the buttons, like a little business suit.
Throw an Easter tie on that and you're set.
It looks like you belong in a Maya catalog, Andrew.
That's a compliment.
Like you're sitting on a lounge suite with happy family.
I'm happy to do my bit to support the Easter Christmas festive season.
And Martin's got his festive balloons for episode 25.
Are there 25 balloons?
Oh look, there are certainly more than 25 little golden ring things.
What is it, confetti or something on the inside of that balloon?
These are actually Natasha's birthday balloons from her aunt.
It's a bit of a tradition that this aunt of hers buys very generous balloons for any family
or a family member or close friend. I'm pretty sure she's keeping this entire business afloat
with her balloon purchases. But today they're festive hemispheric views balloons. And there's
a massive, can you see the massive blue one up the top?
It's not a, it's not a gender reveal situation, is it? Where you pop the balloon, pink or
blue confetti flies out?
It has that vibe. I know. But no, not this time.
Well, I would like to dedicate this show, 25, to Natasha's birthday then. Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
Natasha
Jason says happy birthday. So does Andrew they're dedicating this episode to you
She says thanks
She seemed overwhelmed
you may not have heard that on the recording, but she was just
Giddy with excitement after hearing that we may have to just even tone the volume down in that part
Just because she was so so happy. Yeah about it. Yeah, like a blast of enthusiasm coming through. Yes my head
I'm certainly fatigued with technology this morning. We're recording at a different time. My internet's exploded
I have no idea why I added these into the show notes based on two things that you put in there Andrew
So I'm putting the spotlight on you. Okay, I think it's interesting to discuss when we're overwhelmed with technology
But you also put a thing about the remarkable two in there, which is a case of technology to escape from technology
Anyway, now I'm dumping it on you. So what did you have to say about that?
Well my question I had, in terms of monotony, is it seemed like a few years ago
Maybe I'm just getting old and jaded, but it seemed like there was more excitement around
Releases and particularly being Apple people would get excited about the new Apple tech coming around the corner and all that kind of thing
But I feel like it's just
Getting to a point of relentlessness. Yeah, you know you're getting a new iPhone in September
You know you're getting a new iPad in March
And you know that they're just going to be iterations on the same. I feel like we're just starting to get into this
Feel of just here comes the next iPhone. Let's get excited about it. Let's move on. Let's get excited about the next Mac OS
11.1 that's going to be coming soon because that comes annually as well. Everything's just on this metronomic
cycle, but there's nothing that's really
moving the needle. There's still
There's improvements as incremental improvements, but there's nothing that is grabbing me in the way that that
It's a internet communicator. It's a telephone. It's a you do it better than I do Martin, but you know, are you getting it yet?
Perhaps this year we're gonna see something with VR glasses, but I don't know even that it's not really getting me pumped up
I don't think I care about that. So I don't know. Maybe I'm just being a whinging old man
But what do you guys think is it is it just too monotonous these days? Is it too corporatized?
I think everyone is just spoiled. That's just straight up what I think I everyone is
Become accustomed to getting everything they want anytime they want it and I'm not
Casting this on everyone. I've include myself
I mean
That's part of the issue with the whole Amazon thing that I talked about before was when it's just too damn easy to get stuff
Stuff becomes meaningless. It's almost I think everybody should just have their technology taken away for a year or two
It's our own damn faults because we wish and want everything and then when it's actually provided
We don't know what to do. So we just wish and want for more crap. We place these expectations on these pieces of technology
Eventually they get there and then we're still not satisfied and we want something else
So it's kind of it's it's our own fault
Honestly, and I mean, I'm sure people will argue with me on that and that's fine too.
But I really don't think it's the fault of the, the companies creating these
things, because if you look at what most of this stuff is that we're using every
day, it is mind blowing what the hell we're able to do with these devices
that we put into our pockets.
And I think that just shows how much we've taken for granted.
And we want everything to be 100 when there's nothing in our own lives that we do incrementally
100% better every single year. So I don't know why we expect these devices that are made by us
to be that. That's my kind of initial thought when you said that.
Yeah, I've just been finished reading a book about managing your life in a stoic way.
And they say sometimes you need to, as a thought exercise, imagine the world
worse than what it is so that you appreciate what you've got at the moment.
And it sounds like, you know, imagine, imagine a world with your wife dead.
And now you'll appreciate her so much more that she's here and with you and alive.
So maybe imagine your world without that iPhone in your pocket.
And then you come back to it and you're like, this really is pretty amazing.
So what you are saying is life philosophy to become an optimist,
you should be a pessimist. Yes. Something like that.
That suits me. I'll call it realism or something.
I felt like when I was younger and they were streaming keynotes for the first time or something
there seemed to be more events dotted throughout the year. You had like the music and the iPod events if we're talking about Apple
specifically, you had an iPad one, things were spread out and now they've gone for the big drop of
15 things through an action-packed two-hour infomercial.
So I find it's probably more fatiguing during that particular event that they broadcast and then we move on.
The fatigue that really hits me is that and this is why I saw your other note in our show notes about the remarkable
2 and if anyone doesn't know about that, it's this really interesting paper tablet
It's like uses ink doesn't it that little eink stuff or something? Yeah, like a Kindle
Yeah
like a Kindle but for writing and it's proposed as this escape from
Bright LCD displays and the distractions that you would have away from a notepad
I kind of noticed that there are lots and lots of different things sitting around me all the time
which like Jason said are entirely my fault. You know no one other than the marketers from
these companies told me to buy them but I went out and bought them and now I'm just surrounded.
And then we hit the Easter weekend which is when we're recording and I go I'm not actually
checking things that much. It's been really freeing. I haven't had notifications and devices
around me and as much as I love doing this call the moment that I went to interact with technology
the internet died and here we are. So I think the fatigue for me doesn't come so much from the
release cycle but I'm just surrounded by these things going ping constantly.
I think it's also interesting that whenever there's conversations around stuff like this,
you know, my devices are taking over my life or whatever the case is. It's an interesting
thing that we always tend to say "XYZ device is the problem, I think XYZ device should fix that
problem" and it's like kind of a weird circle you fall into where the thing that's the problem now
Now you're expecting that thing and the people that made that thing to fix the problem that
only exists because you have the thing to begin with.
So it's like, I don't know, like where does that circle end?
At some point we really do have to take responsibility ourselves, I think, to some degree.
Yeah, there's definitely places where, you know, I can't talk about technology addiction
or anything with any kind of professional perspective or anything like that, but it
does become somewhat of a circular argument at some point, I feel like, where we look
at a thing and say there's a problem and expect the thing that is the problem to fix the problem
that it's creating.
I don't know how that could ever work.
Could you provide that to me in a diagram, please?
Yes, I will.
Absolutely.
It will be in the show notes.
As I was saying that, I was like, this is just going, I'm now, I am the circle.
Surprisingly, it did kind of make sense.
I get what you're saying.
You know, like basically we have to take some personal responsibility for all this.
And if we're getting frustrated with tech, do something about it.
If you are finding it boring, step away from it for a while.
Especially all of us in the Apple world are notoriously terrible at this of, you know,
if there were one event a year, we would complain that there's only one.
If there were an event every single day of the year, we would complain that there's too
many events.
There is no perfect thing that the company could do, or any company could do, that would
actually make everyone happy.
And that's just part of human nature, right?
There is no, "Oh, well, if they did these things and then they do those," and you say,
"Well, yeah, but they didn't do these other things that I never even mentioned."
It's like, okay, there's always going to be this push for them to do things that they're
never going to do that you want, and that's never going away.
Ironically, I'm actually hanging out for the upcoming iPad event because my current iPad's
battery lasts only a few hours now, a couple of hours, and I'm desperately wanting a new
iPad but I'm not going to buy one until they have their event, so come on!
Did you also have that blotchy effect?
Because you have the 10.5, which is the same one that I have, one of those earlier Pros,
but you got it replaced, didn't you?
And that's been fine?
Yeah, great memory, Martin.
So yeah, I had it for a year or so, just short of a year, and took it back and they replaced
it with, I guess, a refurb model, which I would assume it had a new battery in it.
And yeah, and yet now, a couple of years on from that, the battery just doesn't last.
I do use the heck out of my iPad though.
But if I've tried to play an arcade game, oh baby, that thing just disappears.
That's actually one of the games to see how fast you can deplete the battery.
Ridiculous.
other than battery life, what do you actually want out of a new one?
Since we're talking about fixing technological problems.
The only problem I have with my current iPad is the battery.
The smudginess of the screen.
That thing gets, I don't know if they've improved that,
but it gets fingerprints like crazy.
And what else do I like? I don't really like the shape.
I'm kind of excited to get one of the squared off edges things.
But that's that's just fashion, really.
The the actual I never noticed my iPad really ever being slow
or struggling with anything. That's a 20... was it 2017? That's four years old now, right?
In terms of design, the one I own is I guess three years old now. If the battery was still...
I was talking to my wife about it. I was like, I could spend 165 bucks on just getting a battery
replacement. Or I could buy the new sexy one for thousands of dollars. And so yeah,
maybe I'm against my own argument here, because which one do you think I want?
You'll find a way to justify it in your spreadsheet, I'm sure. Something that I'd
like them to do, to be honest, is I would just like to have more affordable higher storage
options because this is a big first world problem but like both of you I'm sure I have
a big photo library. All of it lives as kept originals on my Mac so you scroll through
it's all there, everything's instantly loaded. Then you move to this super fast portable
dream machine which has always been based off really really quick SSD technology but
But of course everything's optimized so you sit there waiting for a 1080p or a 4K video
to download in your own library and it kills the moment when you want to show family or
relative something.
So that is something that I find personally fatiguing on something that should be really
quick.
But of course it's going to cost you thousands of dollars to get that storage.
What size devices do you guys use for I guess everything maybe like your computer, your
iPad, your phone?
What do you generally go for?
I'm pretty I'm a bit of a miser like with my iMac
I got the low storage thinking I'll just get an external hard drive which I've done iPads. I usually get the middle one
I've always gotten cellular as well with my iPads. Although maybe this one I wouldn't I'm pretty sure
I've said that the last like six iPads like maybe this time I won't get the cellular and I always
second video
The best part was it my last iPad the 11 that I got the 20
20 version 20 whatever the latest 11-inch iPad is that I bought I think right right as
Pandemic was hitting or so got the cellular version
Been using that a lot not at all. It's just been off for a year
That long really geez for me. My Mac mini is two terabytes
I mean, I got that relatively recently and I thought I need some storage whether it's occasionally downloading a movie or just having all of my
photos like I said. For the 12 mini I actually went down from 256 gigabytes to 128 from my
previous 11 pro just because I thought I would put a lot on there but I never did and I don't
mind the optimization of the storage on that one so much. I always think I'm going to you
know sit down in some public transport situation and enjoy the full length of the matrix or
something but it never happens so you know moving on I made that smaller and I still
have lots of storage left even with all of the videos and photos that I take. And the
iPad which I got years ago, Andrew and I have the same model, I got a 64 gig cellular for
that purely because I was using it differently then. Now that I have more photos and videos
and I'm doing the podcast editing on it, it suddenly feels like more of a primary computer
than it ever did before. So again, this is all just whinging, it depends how you use
the device, but the moment that you put some more stuff on it, it's nice to have some more
space.
noticed that even we've just said here in this is whenever you hear somebody
talking about something that is that they don't like about a certain device
it's always you know Apple should fix X they should fix Y when it and it's funny
because it's you know fix is very specific meaning it's not technically
broken and it may actually be a feature that a lot of other people really really
like that you're saying is technically broken.
But it's interesting that I noticed that and maybe this is kind of across other brand loyalties
too maybe this happens in Windows world, Android world, I'm not sure because I'm not hugely
in that.
But it is always a Apple absolutely has to fix this and it's like I actually like that
it does that so I would prefer them not to quote fix that but maybe just make an option
for you to be able to disable that or whatever but it's very it's always a
it's broken and fix it now yeah but that even applies to things that aren't
technological I think you're exactly right when Natasha and I went out for
dinner the other night at our favorite restaurant in Mulungom we loved the menu
there it is just perfect and they will always rotate specials which are really
great too to give some variety that seems like common sense to me but we
heard people at the table next to us saying they really need to refresh this
menu, you know, they just need to fix it and do some new stuff. And I thought, you're obviously
here because you enjoy it. We're all here enjoying the same food. Like you said, what
are we fixing? So yeah, I agree. It gets very subjective, whether it's tech features or
items on a menu. Just don't fix something that works well.
I don't know. This may not be related at all, but this came into my head. The other day
we were talking about how, what was, oh, remember in, I think it was called Passbook when there
There was the cool little shredder animation where you'd put the little pass would go in
it would shred and we're like, "Oh, that's pretty cool."
Recently something came up where I was thinking, you know, everything...
So we went through this phase where everything was very whimsy.
Everything was about looking like a real thing and all of that.
And it kind of arguably went a little too far in that direction for a while.
And then there was a little bit of a course correction.
And then it started going back the other way.
But I'm kind of feeling like everything's gone maybe too far and it's a little, everything's
just super serious and sterile now.
But I was playing with an app the other day called Alfreed, Alfred, something like that.
It's like Alfred but for reading.
It's like a read it later thing.
Anyway, that's not important.
But one of the things that in their little, what do you call it, where they walk you through
the app, whatever that is, onboarding.
They had this feature, which I'm sure most, you know, majority of people are going to
scoff at me like, "That's so dumb.
Why do they do that?"
But in Read It Later, you often run into the issue where you have articles in there that
have been in there forever that you don't read for whatever reason.
It's been in there for like eight years and you're like, "Someday I'm going to get to
that article."
But they had this thing where it was basically as the article got older, it got dusty.
And you could blow into the microphone to like blow the dust off the article to kind
of bring it back if you wanted to actually read it.
And it was just one of those things where it's like, is that necessary?
No.
But I sure as hell thought it was a really fun idea.
And it's like, do you have to do that?
No, of course you don't have to do it.
But I don't know.
I just feel like maybe we need to get a little bit more of that back.
And it's probably always going to be this teeter totter of too much, not enough, too
much or you know, I hate that.
Why do they put all that fun stuff in there?
It's like, because that's kind of what this stuff is about.
I mean, like I remember in the early days of using a Mac, it was always like, oh, use
a toy computer.
It's like, oh, you mean the one that looks nice?
Yes, that is the one that I use.
Correct.
But yeah, so I just I feel like maybe we need to get a little bit of that back.
And a lot of complaints that I hear now, again, amongst the the Mac head people of why they
they hate Big Sur or why they hate iOS, whatever the hell.
I kind of wonder if maybe it's that,
it's become too sterile and plain
and it doesn't have as much of a personality
maybe as it used to.
I don't know what you guys think about
or maybe you hate the whimsy stuff like that.
But I just thought when it was the little thing
where you blow the dust off, I was like,
that's a fun little thing that isn't necessary,
but I like it.
Kind of like the, when it's your birthday
and the balloons happen on your watch.
I absolutely love that.
And you can do it as many times as you want
throughout the day.
Do they need to put little balloons on your watch?
No, but I'm sure as hell glad that they did.
- Martin is, look at this, Mr. Balloon Man.
- Yeah, we've got actual physical balloons here.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I love those little whimsical skeuomorphic things.
Sometimes I think like with that dusty one you just said,
Jason, read it later services
up being read it never services for me so that would just be completely caked like it would
actually be moisture affected and the microphone blowing thing wouldn't work anymore it would just
be like concrete so yeah but some of them like i think i've whinged before the puff of smoke that
used to exist in the dock oh no longer does it still exists on the toolbar of safari that actually
performs a function it's not just a useless animation because if you were to do it now
And we all know because we've used Max for ages, but if I took a folder or an app icon off my dock
and dropped it, it disappears, but it does the same sort of thing that it might do if you were
putting it somewhere or dropping it somewhere. The puff of smoke actually tells you this is gone.
It has left. It has disappeared. So I think it actually can give very useful context in certain
situations. It's not always redundant. I miss the puff of smoke so much. I used to just put
Put things in the dock just so I could bring them out and get the puff of smoke and I love that
It was like a low res animation as well as like four frames or something
It's like it just totally out of place, but brilliant
So bring back the shredder and bring back the and the dis and and the closed box area on notifications
Fix that and I'm happy and the proxy icon. Oh, yeah, the prototype. Yes. Oh god. Oh the proxy icon
Oh my god, if they don't bring that they should fix that immediately. You guys are taking the piss
I'm serious. Yeah, 100% taking all of the piss on this proxy icon. Proxy icons are brilliant.
Best thing on the Mac OS. Never used it. It's useless. Everyone's angry now.
Talking about managing technology, I really want to hear about this from Andrew because
this is like an anal retentive organizational dream, right?
I'm seeing Johnny Decimal in the list.
We've talked about managing devices, but managing things within software,
things within your file system.
Andrew, what do you have to say about Johnny Decimal and who is he?
Johnny Decimal, what a name, eh?
He's an Australian guy.
I think he's based in Canberra.
So that makes him pretty good guy.
Showing about the Canberra bit, but everything else is pretty good.
Wow.
Okay.
Johnny Decimal, he's got a website.
I think it was johnnydecimal.com.
Unfortunately, it can't be johnny.decimal, which would be the ideal URL, but we don't
have that.
Is it .com or .com.au?
It's .com.
It's cheaper and there's less restrictions on getting it.
It's hard to get a .au.
You've got to have a business and that kind of stuff.
Weird side tangent.
Sorry to interrupt you on the Johnny Decimal, but when there's like .co.uk, .co.au, .com.au,
whatever. I don't understand why the hell you would want that when dot-com is so prevalent
and just shorter. Yeah. Any any thought? I mean, I guess I don't know what you would
have to say about that, but I just I'm confused as to why you would pick that, I guess, if
the other ones not available. I think for governmental things that make sense, like
you'll see dot gov a lot internationally, but dot gov dot au or dot gov dot UK or whatever
would just denote where it is, but for businesses, everything's increasingly international. So
I agree, it doesn't really make much sense anymore.
Okay, back to you crapping all over where this fine gentleman is from.
Yeah, but he seems like a lovely chap. I haven't spoken to him directly, but there's now a forum
for Johnny Decimal, Acolytes. Started off on Slack, realized that Slack was useless,
quickly moved to Discord, much better. There's also a discourse forum, so it's really,
That's going, that's going ahead great, great guns as well.
What is Johnny Decimal?
It's a system to organize files.
You guys excited yet?
Oh, I'm pumped.
I'm sorry, I must have been muted.
You didn't hear my excitement.
I was ringing a bell really loudly when you mentioned file systems.
So it's sometimes hard to find files, right?
The Johnny Decimal thing is all about creating numbered category systems
and putting everything in one of those buckets.
But you cannot have any more than 10 buckets.
So you create like a high level category that might be finance and legal.
And that all sits within categories 10 to 19.
And then so category 11 might be banking.
12 might be pending lawsuits.
13 might be bank statements.
14 mortgage.
And then within those, so then they've got an address.
So then you know that mortgage lives at 10 decimal dot 10 dot 14.
And then you just, and it sounds so basic, right?
Isn't that the Dewey decimal system?
Isn't that the same thing?
I like the Dewey decimal system as well, which is probably what appealed to me about this.
So it's all about knowing and then you can share that information.
So if you're in a business or something, they can say, "Hey Dave, where's the pending legal
cases and you can just say, "Oh, the legal case, they're in 10.12."
Dave doesn't know.
Dave never knows.
Why do we even hire Dave?
So it's a category, it's an ID thing, and there's a whole description on their website,
Johnny Desimov, how to do it.
It's a lovely looking website as well.
It's one of these things you can just squirrel into when you've got nothing better to do
or if you're trying to avoid doing real work.
I have two questions.
Have you implemented this?
Yes, I've been trying to
I've actually input it's sort of structured around the idea that most people
Would keep stuff in the finder or the Windows Explorer or wherever
I've been Johnny decimalizing my dev and think databases, which is actually where most of my stuff lives
Can you say that ten times quickly? Boy, if that doesn't sound like the dream, I don't know what does
Question number question number two when I talk about this. I realize how boring and nerdy it sounds
So I'm probably not really not doing myself any favors. No, I guarantee not one of our
Thousands of Amazon podcast listeners have skipped this chapter yet
Mostly because Amazon probably doesn't support chapters or short note show notes or anything that looks nice
Question two I had was how long until I open up our podcast folder and find everything Johnny decimalized
It may happen. I didn't want to
I feel like our folders are actually quite neat already, which is good. It's a good start, but
What happened? I mean look I I Johnny decimalize my own
Folders, so look I've got in my finder. I did do some Johnny Johnny decimalization
So in my documents folder, I can tell you that podcasting lives between 60 and 69
Obviously. Yeah, so and haven't yet gone down the next route because if I start numbering then you will start to be impacted by it
Because I've got a shared folder under there. It would be 61 hemispheric views
62 NBL pocket podcast 63 keep practicing rest in peace. Oh
Too soon. Yeah, so look got to start
Roman numeral three how many pending lawsuits do you have?
None, okay good, but I like to stay prepared. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Then maybe they're not pending
Pre-pending I know people talk about the Feld foot all the time constantly
You know going and meddling with an em dash or semicolon or two
but I particularly enjoyed in our old in our own folder structure recently that our
raw mp3 our editing folders were recently amended the title now includes
Assets or something because I think I must have dropped in a picture in there and someone was offended
Does anyone want to own up to that? Yeah, that was me. I
Know it was non-descriptive
It wasn't just rice raw audio or whatever it was it had assets and I was like because I went looking for another folder
Do we have a mirror folder for assets related to that episode? I could find it. I don't blame you
I wanted to congratulate you, but we all have our thing
Well, if it would have been in Johnny decimal, you would have been able to find it. Yeah, we all have our own thing
Well, it's not just me as well. There are a number I want it
I'm gonna shout out here particularly
One member of there's a number of micro blog people who are involved and I think this shows an interesting
personality type that enjoys both micro blog and
folder organization one of the people who's really got behind it is at Jack on
Microblog he of the million blogs
He constantly changes his blogging platforms. He changes everything all the time
That's why he uses Johnny decimal. Yeah, I think so. So so you can find them all
Yep, and Johnny Desmond is looking to build some sort of software to help with the automatic numbering and
Generation of numbers and that kind of thing. So he's trying to think of how what he might be able to
Build it out into more of an automated system, but join the forum get involved nice people
interesting to conversations if you're just looking to expand your
Organizational horizons and you would still encourage people to get in involved in this even though he's from Canberra. Nobody's perfect
Yeah in a roundabout way of saying I hope he's not listening I'm just trying to get you in I hope he is I
Can't wait till I do research on this and find out what the issue is with this location if you don't like roundabouts
There are a lot of them there. Are they always beating the Wildcats? Is that the issue here?
Is it like the the camp the camber roundabouts are much better than I know that wildcat?
No, they couldn't even maintain the team.
They used to have the Canberra cannons, but they went defunct.
Do you have an issue with Questacon, Andrew?
Is that what it is?
Questacon's alright.
It was a bit, it can be aged the last time I visited.
I like the big ramp that you walk down.
Yeah.
Jason, do you know about Questacon?
It's a gigantic science center or like learning area that is very family
friendly, and despite my numerous efforts to sanitize years ago, this is well
before COVID was a thing, sanitizing between touching lots of different
exhibits, because it's very interactive.
I still managed to catch conjunctivitis from that place.
And that's not against Questacon, great establishment, it was just my poor luck.
It's a package deal.
Just imagine thousands of primary school kids poring through a venue day in day out, all
doing their trip to Canberra as part of their civic duty.
[Music]
Media Corner!
Jason, what do you got?
I have a television show today.
I don't know if I've done television shows yet.
Usually I do games.
This television show I found on...
I think it's Netflix.
I'm starting to forget where the heck I'm finding things now because they're all just kind of there.
They're on the- I found it on my TV. That should be helpful for everyone.
It's a British television series, I believe. It's called The Repair Shop. The thing here is family
heirlooms. People bring in different things from their past to be restored, but it's a little bit
different because these the people they have on the show are like just hyper
specifically experts in different things. So somebody will be you know all I do is
ceramic statue repair and then this guy only does clock mechanisms. This guy this
lady maybe does like saddles. So it's just they're very hyper focused and
hyper perfection at what they do.
So they just bring in these old things and it's amazing to see the
transformation from, you know, the broken crumbling family heirloom into this
seemingly, they don't, the thing I like about it too, is they don't just take
something and make it look like it's brand new because that's, then it kind
of loses a lot of what it meant to the family.
So they just bring it back to a place where it is a functional, holistic piece again,
but still retains its kind of age and appeal.
Um, so yeah, it's just, it's so cool to see these people do these very, very.
Artistic and specific fixes for these different things.
And there's maybe, I don't know, 10 or 11 different people.
and sometimes they bring in specialists for very specific things.
Anyway, it's called The Repair Shop, and it's
it's a fun show to watch.
Even if you just kind of use it as one of those in the background
while you're maybe doing your Johnny Decimal
and you got to have something else going on.
Give it a look.
I think I think it's Netflix and there's there's a bunch of seasons.
I'm only on like maybe episode seven or eight of season one.
Is there a specific heirloom or object that you saw that was really interesting?
Something that you hadn't seen before?
Good question. I think I had not seen it specifically in myself, but there was a
toy car that was maybe, maybe like the size of a breadbox, but it had a full working
rack and pinion steering and everything in it, and this thing was just destroyed.
And they took that thing back to fully working the little steering wheel worked again all the wheels moved and
Some of the stuff they bring in it's like that's not gonna get fixed and boom. There you go. It's working again
I feel like the English have a really good culture for this kind of stuff
They seem to have a lot of old things and they they value that
I don't know what it's like in the US, but we just don't have that culture of
Inspiration or like you watch these sort of baby shows BBC shows or whatever you and they're like, oh, here's a grandfather clock from
300 years ago or something. You're not gonna have that in Australia. This is just no
There's no capability and there's no stock, you know, you would never find such a thing
If it seems that the UK are really good at creating that kind of show
Engagement, you know the sort of the antiques the antique roadshow
Kind of stuff. It's the first show like this that and it felt different
There's a lot this is not a new concept to bring in something that's broken and have it fixed
But for some reason just maybe it's the things they're bringing in or I think it's more so that it's not
Usually usually these shows there's like, you know
a handful of five or six people and they all kind of are
Generalists to a certain degree and well, we'll get it done or if it's like a car thing
We all kind of know how to work on cars. So we'll just sort of make this car look good again
This one is cool because it's like here's a thing and like oh
This is definitely so-and-so and then maybe a little bit of this other person too because this really fits there too
specific
You know things that they do
I think that gives it a little bit of a different feel which is cool
And then you're always seeing different people and different processes in each one. Nice good pick Martin
Natasha and I recently went down memory lane watching a movie that I don't think either of us had seen for at least 10 or 15 years
Actually, maybe even longer. This was a childhood favorite
And you know when you revisit a piece of media, particularly a movie that you haven't seen for a long time
And you just go, what on earth was going on?
Well, the movie was Billy Madison by Adam Sandler
And I don't know the... I assume you've both seen that movie
Yep. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I've seen it and already I'm trying to remember like I don't
really recall what it even was about. Right. Okay. Well, if people are listening and they
haven't seen the movie, the basic premise without ruining anything is that Adam Sandler plays
the son of this hotel magnate, right? This millionaire or billionaire who has this whole
chain of hotels and he wants to, well, he didn't really know that he wanted to, but when he found
out that he wasn't going to inherit the company because he's too much of an irresponsible loser
he decides to go back through each grade of school to prove to his father that he has the
commitment and educational knowledge and abilities to run the place and I just remember it being this
hilarious movie from when we were kids and watching it again it is indeed very funny and silly but
the thing that struck me was how absolutely nonsensical it is. When I was a kid I just
accepted this premise, right, this story just washed over me and we're sitting there and I'm
going "why on earth is he eating glue? Why on earth is one of the teachers putting glue all
over her face?" and we just sat there looking at each other going "some of the scenes in this,
it's like this patchwork of nonsense and a lot of it I actually wonder if you could make in
today's current Hollywood situation. Do you have other examples like that where, you know,
whether it's post #MeToo or whatever, or whether people buy into the whole idea of
cancel culture and stuff. I don't open a political can of worms, but stuff that
you watch again and even though it's funny you think "that wouldn't pass today, that couldn't
be made." Basically every movie and TV show that I watch from the past. Your whole collection.
Like every single one there'll be something where I'm like "oh, damn, oh, that doesn't,
That, nope, you don't want to, that's not good. Yeah, but most things I would say, I'll put it
this way, I'm surprised when I get through an old movie/TV show where I don't say,
wow, that really didn't, that was not a thing you should have said. That was bad.
Yeah, I feel like it seems like culture has really taken a quick shift, hasn't it? It was
sort of the same for a long period of time. And in the last two years, maybe, even if that,
It's just been like hit the brakes change direction 90 degrees. We're doing we're doing things different now, and I really feel like it's been a
noticeable change
Whereas for 20 30 years it was all kind of like same same. Yeah, absolutely
So I'm not you know crapping on a movie like Billy Madison
It was still very funny, and you know there were lots of silly scenes
I think if you hadn't seen it as a child or of that particular period because I think it's from 1995 which really isn't that long
ago historically speaking but really a long time ago like Andrew said we've had
this cultural shift so if you watch it as an adult or you never saw it before
you're probably watching and go this is ludicrous and horrible but yeah I'd
encourage people to watch it if they hadn't seen it just to see what they
think or if you're not interested choose something from the archives of the past
or an old DVD on the shelf of something that was a real favorite when you were
younger revisit it and see if it's still acceptable or even funny particularly
it's comedy and if you do find something as a listener send it in to us because I'd like
to know what it is.
All right I was going to say I don't know if we want to edit this out because it might
be news for another day.
Probably.
But talking about old comedy shows that don't hold up too well, been watching the Golden
Girls.
Yeah, doesn't hold up at all.
Part of a potential project that I'm spitballing at the moment.
Seriously I don't know if I want to edit this out.
I'm getting a thumbs up that it stays.
So yeah, the golden girls.
Wow.
Where do I even start?
Watched it recently.
Well, watched it as if it's one thing I watched the first episode recently and
within along the lines of what we're talking about right now, within maybe the
first minute I was like, Oh wow, really?
This is, I don't remember it being like this at all.
Um, it wasn't, I don't think it was horribly offensive necessarily, but you
You can tell that there was definitely some undertones in this show of like, wow, that's
not appropriate at all to say or think, but here we are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm curious to see where this goes into episode two through 127, but it falls squarely in
the category of what Martin's talking about, where you had a mental image of what the show
was and I've, you know, I've seen plenty of the show in the past, but it's a lot different
than I remember.
So I've gone on a Golden Girls little thing.
It all started from a GIF that Jason presented, Blanche Devereaux.
I thought, oh Blanche, I have a lot of Golden Girls memories.
So I thought I'm going to watch an episode.
Because of the proxy icon.
Yeah, yeah.
That's where, yeah, that's actually.
Actually is where it stemmed from.
So full circle.
Watch the first episode of Golden Girls watch the second episode and I thought
What if what if you did a short podcast about each of the Golden Girls episodes?
You had five minutes
you make you a three points about the episode in you're out and
I'm presenting to Jason Martin's just like he's too young. He's doesn't want to do this
But Jason I think Jason I think may have he may be enough about the gut must have the heritage of Golden Girls in him
We thought what if we did a podcast five-minute podcast per episode called the golden guys
Would people listen I?
hope so I
Have I have put this to a number of friends of mine. They've all they've all been women actually
But I have had nothing but positive reactions to that the idea of a five-minute podcast
That's they're not committing a lot of time, but just a retrospective episode by episode
This could be a winner. I hear it's big on Amazon podcasts. So I think it should be a thing
There should at least be a pilot. They should be so let us know let us know in the I don't know
How did happen reach out to us?
Twitter discord discourse micro blog at golden guys on Twitter. Have you got that already? I haven't yet. Oh crap
I'm gonna go register like 15 domains before this thing comes out
Is the profile image just gonna be you two with poofy hair?
Basically the the idea yeah the cover arts getting pretty close
But I was thinking we just kind of paste our faces in with them in there like kind of
They're the logo that they have for them
We would just kind of be in the background or maybe in the foreground like a badly photoshopped family portrait
We're like, you know on
Bessie didn't show up to the family gathering so you had to Photoshop her in later that kind of thing
So Andrew's Blanche, who are you Jason? I'm not entirely sure to be perfectly honest
I had an opinion but now she's already starting to be a little bit, you know of a problematic issue for me
So now I'm kind of thinking maybe I don't want to associate with that one
So I'm gonna need a few episodes to really kind of hone in on on who my persona is going to be
So I'm not, you know associated with
with certain
beliefs I
I have been doing a lot of research though about anything that may be an issue regarding the show and backlash over the years
and I haven't found anything yet so...
Oh that's good. So watch out for that one. Potentially.
I think just by recording this podcast and drawing attention to the show those issues may arise. So you two could be the catalyst.
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm that's what I'm worried about. This is a little bit of a
If you took a landmine and you filled it full of hornets nests
and then wrapped it in spiders australian spiders, obviously
and then
Tried to step on that
That's kind of what I feel like may happen. I'd listen to that. Yeah, so we'll see
So you're the golden guys who kicked the hornet's nest. It sure feels like it could go that way
Well, you know let me know whenever you have all the accounts up tell the listeners
Uh, you might have some new golden girls fans out there to connect with the internet's really big and there's room for everything
That's what i'm saying. Perfect
I have to start a pickle podcast or something now for the few people on my friend or blog who actually like pickles
Wow, didn't that turn into something? There was some real pickle haters out there. Absolutely and just cucumbers in general. I was
Flabbergasted. Yeah, next thing we'll have we'll have big cucumber coming after us. We had big avocado probably
you know like how they talk about how TV shows go into space and then
Eventually aliens will hear them millions of years from now
I'm convinced that our last episode was actually like the reverse of that
so it was coming back from another planet outside our solar system and
It just you know, the bits got flipped
Got interjected it into the fireside. It somehow got published and there it was so
So does that mean aliens use Australia Post?
Yes. Yeah, that's why it took so long to get here. I want a pair of those Nike shoes though. Wouldn't those be great?
Ethernet ports in both shoes, even though you only need one. What will they come up with next?
Well, and that thing that fixes everything that I really didn't even understand
[MUSIC PLAYING]
OK, can you-- let's start with Martin.
Can you please say, far out, as though you are Australian,
which you are, and you are reacting to something legitimately as if it were upsetting you.
Far out.
Okay, now, Andrew, please go.
I'm just going to channel the anger.
Far out.
Okay, see, I'm never going to...
I have a lot of work to do because I really want to get to be in the community that can
say it correctly, but I think there's an issue with my vocal cords that don't allow me...
northern hemisphere vocal cords don't work to do the FAH space 20% R like it's
not a full R it's a 20% R out it's like a few to exclaim the beginning of the F
word but not finish it how would that sound do that now like fuh yeah but like
extended likes likes you've just realized that agents are about to take
you away they've burst in through the door behind you they're pulling you away
And we only hear the trail off the microphone. Oh
Yeah, but extended that's what you're gonna do just don't end it with an R don't end it with an R
Yeah, it's like far the R is there you don't know you have the little bit of R at the end
That's the thing. You're not seeing it. Oh, yeah, you're too close to really push you to the extreme so that you remove it
You're in the forest. You can't see the tree that is the little R. That's the issue
You gotta try I'm gonna keep practicing. Come on. Give us your best shot. It's like far out that doesn't that do it again
I didn't hear that far. That was pretty good. Far out. See you then to my out gets not out was wrong
far out
Far out
See, even the "out" sounds weird.
"Fall out!"
I can't...
"Fall out!"
It's like I get a "W".
I get a "W".
I get a "wout".
"Fall out".
It just doesn't work.
I want it so bad.
I think you should just stick with that because it's pretty good.
"Far out".
Ah, f***.
Yeah, stick with that one.
He's a six year old with a lisp.
"Fall out!"
I think the issue is that I think because I am American,
American I think we're just stuck with with just the full-on
four letter
F-word
Like that's just what we have. I don't think we're allowed to have I just so here's the issue
Is that I routinely swear too much on this podcast?
So I was hoping that I could take on the far out as a replacement because it's not offensive or just in general
You're doing your are and your tea you're over enunciating swallow both. I'm gonna keep practicing and I'm gonna you're saying far out
I'm going to keep practicing. Oh, it's good name for a podcast keep practicing calm
you and
I'll try to do it next time better
Well, look I put on probably not my best American accent an episode ago and heard Australian isms throughout the whole thing
So I have to keep practicing - yeah. Hey Andrew, do you think you might keep practicing?
I need to do one. I know the feet the feets drying up
I don't I don't want to I don't want to be cruel but in the podcast player
It currently says that the schedule is inactive
Alright
Doesn't say that doesn't say that for lounge ruminator
Gentle prawns looking for mine now gentle gentle prod. No, I think that one's like every two weeks on Thursday or something
So something to ruminate on at the end of this episode when will the next keep practicing?
Into the faith. Maybe this was it very soon. Yeah
Far out guys. Leave me alone. Next time with Jason Burke and Andrew Kenyon
Can you say far out far out you're picking on me out far out?
Okay, I'm going there. See you guys
Bye Martin. Hey, we're countdown. We're end three. Let's try this one three two. Wait, oh three two one stop
