Music.
Tech adjacent tech adjacent Mac fans guys we're not a podcast if we don't talk about the Apple event you realize that.
I think we'd still technically be a podcast but point taken.
Not a tech adjacent one adjacent adjacent tech adjacent.
Yeah so should we just knock that off and then we can get to the real stuff.
What you got okay well seeing as I created the thing on the freeform a lead off.
You've been the one in in in crisis for four weeks of happening Christ just the everyone just harassing you,
pushing you into it into the gutter like spitting on you and and like just leaving hurtful notes on your windshield.
It's a lot of hate for the iPhone 13 mini.
In WA apparently yeah.
Just get slammed.
Not in this household.
Yeah.
It's in a shrine with glowing little Jesus lights around it.
It's like the like how they did the first iPhone and it was in that tube on the little spinny
Like stick that's that's where Martin keeps his phone every night. That's what I have on my bedside table. Yeah
With like 40,000 lumens of light shining out
This is why he doesn't sleep. Yeah, the nightstand for US listeners is more like one of those
What's the type of I've forgotten the word the tubes that you see in Futurama or futuristic supermarkets or something?
Yep, pneumatic. That's it pneumatic. Chutes are so cool. How cool would that be to have that in your house?
I feel like if I was building a house today, I would put those in. Mm-hmm just to send stuff around
It just goes. Yeah, that'd be brilliant. I think that'd be fun. Well, anyway, that's what my 13 mini goes in. Oh perfect
So Apple event I thought I better watch it see what they're gonna come out with
Is this something that will maybe replace the 13 mini in my life so I can stop getting abused by random people?
Yeah, got to say the Apple event it was boring I watched it so I had it on my iPhone.
Well I was doing other things so I was sort of multitasking and I got to the beat just before the iPhone pro announcement.
Stopped it because I couldn't handle anymore I'm sick of this is boring.
I didn't watch the bit about the iPhone Pro.
It was a little odd.
It was death by video, I felt, that keynote.
Just too many skits and little bits and pieces and I just couldn't get into it.
And the audio mix was terrible.
I think that was just you coming through on a 13 mini.
I have had it corroborated by one other person that the audio mix is weird.
So you'd have to turn up to hear their voices.
What were you watching it on?
13 mini.
No, but where, what was the source?
Was it YouTube?
Was it?
Oh no, it was the Apple, like the Apple website or Apple TV, Apple TV app.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I think it seems like it was probably the mix.
So there was probably mixed in stereo, not stereo.
What do they call the one more better than stereo?
Surround?
Like Atmos or something.
Atmos?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, so whenever the whenever the the beats came on in the transitions, it was like
And then you go to a talking guy and you couldn't hear them
You have to turn it up and then you forget that you turned it up and then their transition again, and it'd be like
So I got to the end of the event and I decided looks like the 13 mini despite all the abuse
I have held my way. It's gonna survive another year because there was
It was incremental. It was like, yeah, it's fine. It's great like good improvements
I'm not knocking them
but there was nothing that made me think am I gonna get a massive difference in my life from upgrading from my mini to a
Newer phone or a bigger phone. I'm a little bit confused if I can
Interrupt you. Sorry. I'm not in the business of saying go and buy a new phone
Cause yourself expense. Let's be sustainable. Like if you like your phone just keep it
But in previous recordings you've said that you are so annoyed about your mini and that people have come to essentially loathe you on the street because you're some pleb with a tiny phone and gigantic hands.
Physical attacks.
Yeah and it's you said it's incremental but isn't it a massive jump for you from the 13 mini if it's what you want.
What's true but actually a really big upgrade for you personally it's true man but you're also you're running up against my other.
Issue in that spending money you know I hate spending money but do a trade in well.
So it goes back into the whole recycling mix and you save some money well funny you should mention that Martin because yesterday still after not having.
Watch the iPhone pro video nor having looked at the iPhone pro website.
I ordered an iPhone pro well there you go that was easy and after I ordered the iPhone pro.
I went and watch the video about it and look at the website about it and was like that's a nice fine I'm pretty excited about this.
And then you got angry because you saw it was USB-C you didn't know it was coming that one on you.
I think he was probably more angry about the exchange rate.
Mmm, it's not great. I saw the price. It was like, wow, that is,
it was like 1930s Germany had to roll up the Apple store with a trolley full of
notes. Very much like that. It was definitely worse than I know in previous years,
you've sent me like the price in Australian dollars. And I was always like, Oh,
wow, that's a lot. But I feel like it was like double this year compared to like,
like just doing like USD to AUD. Just, I mean, I know it's whatever, whatever.
But like when you just see numbers to numbers, it's like holy crap
And that was kind of like I'm just gonna do it because
Who knows how long like the wait because I thought I could just wait
but then I thought my trading value on my iPhone mini is just gonna deteriorate and
What's the point of hanging around? Um, ultimately I will probably get a new phone
So I might as well just get it for as long as possible. So that's the the mindset I went in with
Good news though after doing all the transactions and spent you know spending the money I fired up my spreadsheet
And I just did a bit of quick analysis. I'm not sure if you guys are interested. Oh
I'm on the edge of my seat
While so we're here yeah, okay, so looking back through a little bit of a history of my phones
Not all the way back, but starting at the iPhone 8 plus. I'm gonna regret this I can already tell go ahead
Okay, that cost me eight dollars seventy nine a week
Just hearing you say that I don't something about the blah blah blah a week I don't know what it is about that but it just feels like someone is stabbing me in the head with with a letter opener.
I'm very interested go on this is factoring in both the amount I paid for and then the resale value I got for it at the other end so you know that's it's utilizing all that that does data points I had it for 61 weeks.
Then I had the iPhone XR, I can't remember what we called it.
- XR. - XR.
I had that for 63 weeks.
Yeah, 63 weeks.
At just $1.90 a week, that was a cheap phone.
- Wow, that was. - The iPhone 13 mini.
Okay, I'm presuming that I'm gonna dispose of this when the new,
I've preset a disposal date for it.
That works out just actually $2.76 per week,
Which actually makes it a pretty good deal how many weeks was a 62 no this is amazing Jason
I had that for a hundred and eight weeks Wow you heard it here first. That's two years
Yes, the others only made it just over a year
Yeah, the iPhone 13 mini and it still has plenty of life in it
It's gonna be recycled and sent back or whatever they do with them. I
I hope you'll go to a second life somewhere.
God bless you, iPhone 13 mini,
a cheap, affordable phone for the masses
that's no longer sold.
- Can I ask you a favor, Andrew?
- Sure.
- I don't know if it's something
for the Hemispheric Views blog on our website
or something for your own blog,
but can we actually have some sort of written piece
for you that details all of this in a table
so that listeners can scroll through
and look at their own leisure?
That's a great idea because I created this list using a filter in numbers from my
my data set.
So yeah, I can absolutely write a blog post, markdown table, something lovely.
Because I feel like there are people out there in the listenership who are way more enthusiastic about this than Jason is.
I can tell from the pain on his face right now.
It's like he's been struggling to go to the toilet for about three hours.
That's how visibly uncomfortable he is about this.
But there are people out there who I reckon will love it.
Well I've got one bit of good news that might pep Jason up.
Okay give it to me.
The spreadsheet line for the iPhone 15 Pro in natural titanium of course.
Okay.
So I don't currently own it and it's coming ostensibly the 18th of October.
Wow.
So it's negative it's negative four weeks in service.
Can I ask you a question before you go on?
Yeah.
So you said October what 18th?
Yep.
So when I'm just curious, when did you, you obviously didn't order like right away.
So was this like a next day, just kind of casual order or what was your,
I ordered it yesterday.
Okay. So you sat on it for a while and yeah. Okay.
And you're still only about a month out. It's not too bad. Yep. Okay.
Yeah. I can live with that. Yeah. So negative four weeks of ownership.
It's actually costing me per week, negative $465.
So the way I think about it is Apple is almost paying me at this point.
That's, this is why I have, this is why I love this system so much.
Cause it just makes so much sense.
Oh yeah.
Thank you for putting that into perspective for me.
And that was the Apple event.
Have you directed Apple or Apple representatives to canyon.blog/save?
I reckon they could really send some funds your way.
I feel like I need to get one of those new, one of those new Mac pros.
Because if I order it now and it doesn't deliver for a couple of weeks,
they're going to be paying me like 10 grand a day or something.
That's what it sounds like.
You can there's always a loophole.
You just have to find it.
I love it.
Cool. I have I have a follow on to loopholes
later on in the show, so look out for that.
OK, I guess the sentiment across the board was that it was, quote unquote,
boring, but like it's an iPhone.
Every iPhone event is incremental.
What do you expect? Like, it does, it's not going to like come with like, I don't know,
something that is like an anti-gravity machine. Like, what do you want? It's a phone.
I expect blow away performance.
It has that.
That was my Tim Cook attempt.
Every single year. It's like crazy performance. But I thought the Mother Nature thing was
actually really fun. I think it was much better than, here's a slide with like,
like some numbers and like we're going to talk about, you know, green, this green, that
I thought it was more fun to do it as a sketch. And like I try to ignore as much as possible
anyway talking about this stuff on the internet while it's happening because it's just annoying
and horrible. But it kind of seemed like there was this thing like, oh, it's it's like, like
they're doing it bad. It's like that was the point. Like it was supposed to be like they
were kind of taking a dig at themselves because I think they they understand that no one else
else really well I shouldn't say no one else most companies don't talk about
this or give this much kind of airtime in a major event to this kind of stuff
so they kind of acknowledge like we know we shove this down your throat every
year so we're we're acknowledging that we're gonna try to make it fun ish this
year so I don't know I thought it was pretty good and on top of that sorry
mother nature said in the sketch this is like the fifth corporate social
responsibility meeting I've been to this yeah so they were taking the yeah yeah
For sure they were delivering sustainable messages in an accessible way. So I think I think it was fun
Hmm, so over to you Chevron look forward to seeing your mother nature skip next year
Brought to you by shell oil
Let's review a desk this one's been in our queue for a while. Okay. Yes. Hold on
It's free form so I can zoom way in and get a nice crisp
Picture and we better get through it quickly before we're out of time. Oh good call
Hint hint. Does anybody already know what desk it is? Ooh, I bet the person who submitted it does
Should we have Andrew go first so they can cancel their subscription right away or do we want to make them wait for that?
Let's go alphabetically Andrew Jason. Okay, how about that seems fair?
Okay. Yeah, so I let me just sure what should we just we should just call it your times up Andrew Jason. What do you?
That was excellent. I told you we're out of time out of time
Maybe we should go back in time and give Andrew some more time
All right, so can I name whose desk this is sure? Yeah, that would help probably be good
Rob's good friend Rob who remember you might remember wrote a an excessive blog post as he went back
Through time listening to all our back catalog
So he he used the DeLorean the reason we're mentioning all these back to the future jokes is that he has a
License plate that says out of time from back to the future movies. He's got a Marty McFly poster on the wall
I don't see any other references to that movies those movies, but it could be there
What I am saying, I'm seeing a lot of stuff. I'm seeing a lot of stuff in these dusting
I'm seeing a lot of work just to maintain this law little
figurines, little Lego heads,
lots of activity going on here,
little hanging board with lots of plants, including Groot.
Just a lot of stuff, you know, books, figurines,
gaming controllers.
Rob, you need to find an interest and focus in on it.
You've just got too much going on, my friend.
Like, who are you?
What do you enjoy?
Because I can't get a read on this.
You profess that you like technology, you write a blog.
Okay, cool, you got some computers there.
We also know that you record podcasts.
You make that cool one about that driving movie,
Fast and Furious, I think it is.
Too fast, too furious, I don't know.
- Driving movie.
- I think that's actually the tagline for that show
is that cool podcast about that driving movie.
- Okay, so I think, okay.
- I feel like Andrew was Tokyo drifting off course
right there.
- A little bit.
Obviously really likes those movies.
Would you know that looking at this desk?
So Rob, you've got all these little things here, but there's no Tokyo Drift.
There's no Vin Diesel.
There's no family sort of stuff here.
What's going on?
What do you really enjoy?
Hmm.
Interesting.
The only thing I say you might have is, you may have.
Is Jason moving the photo?
It's gone crazy.
It's going crazy on the screen.
I thought Freeform,
I thought we had our own individual viewports,
but Jason is going mad.
That mouse mat thing might be a Tokyo Drift reference
'cause it looks kind of Japanese, Yakuza-y.
So I don't know, maybe that's it.
The desk is just a slab of wood.
Like, is that a desk?
What is holding up?
Look down at the bottom.
There's like, it's like he's built his own desk,
but hasn't quite finished it.
He's just propped it up on some drawers or something.
So Rob, I like your efforts,
but could be an occ health and safety issue there.
If that desk is to fall on you, everything would break.
All your Lego figurines would break
and your knees would be broken.
So think about that.
I like that you have your elevated laptop on a riser.
That's good.
I still don't like that open soft drink can.
And if that is an energy drink, Rob, I'm sorry,
get rid of it it's unhealthy and not good for you.
Health advice.
Right. Martin, over to you.
Or is it Jason?
What's the alphabet?
I think it's me. I think the alphabet still would have me going second.
So...
Where do I even...
Where do I even dive in here?
So, you mentioned the desk. I guess I'll start there.
It's at the bottom.
I actually think the desk is fine. It seems like it's sitting on...
Sitting on potentially like a gaming PC is the right leg of the desk. I think which is interesting
I'm not sure but it kind of looks like that
There's the big the big headphones like you have I think they maybe are the same ones
I don't know because I think those came up at some point and you got offended because somebody said something about them. So
There's that what do you take? What do you take to get 50 X? Yeah. Yeah, that's the one something like that
There's like a million gaming controllers, but there's no consoles. I can't understand where the actual consoles are
So that's confused. He just hangs them like Christmas decorations
They're just dotted around and you can see like his take on mistletoe hanging on the wall. Oh, okay. Yep. That makes sense
I got it. I'm very confused by I think this is one of those artifacts of
I'm assuming this is like a point five wide-angle
Photo so, you know how things kind of get weird and warped when you do the wide angle
It's making the quote unquote external monitor
look basically the same size as the laptop,
which seems very weird to me.
'Cause it would be like a 16 inch laptop
with like a 16 inch display next to it.
And it feels like it's a mile away
from the edge of the desk.
So I have to think that's just like a weird warping
of the shot, I'm gonna hope.
'Cause otherwise I don't know how you could see that far.
Desk mat, I love a desk mat.
You can't go wrong there.
A lot of little things.
We talked about a lot of little things.
I think I see, and I hope it's what I'm seeing here,
is a, like a tiny Raspberry Pi case that looks like an NES.
I'm very excited about that, if that's what that is.
- Where's that?
- And I can't, dead center below the,
quote unquote, big monitor.
I'm zooming in.
- With the wrapped up cable on top of it.
- Yes, yes.
- Looks like.
- Oh yeah.
- It kind of looks like a little NES, but long wise.
So like it would be like a Raspberry Pi maybe.
There's an eyesight camera up there as a decoration,
I think, or maybe he's using it.
I have several of those around my office.
So good on you there.
Plus three desk points for the eyesight camera.
I don't know how Andrew didn't mention anything
about this lamp that's like a weird bent piece of wire.
It makes me uncomfortable.
I couldn't tell you why it just, I don't know.
It's an odd thing and I don't think I like it.
So I would probably put that somewhere else,
some other room that needs to go in.
- Do you remember, sorry, can I just interrupt?
- Yeah. - You may know,
back in the olden days,
old ladies used to sometimes take little hooks
that they could take to a restaurant
and clip the hook onto the dinner table
and then hang their handbag from said hook during dinner.
Is that what this is?
That's what that lamp looks like.
It looks like you would hook it over your table and just hang your handbag.
Gotcha.
Okay.
I hope Rob knows what I'm talking about.
Do you have one of your briefcase, Andrew?
I don't, but I wish I did.
That would actually be a fantastic idea.
We should get you one of those, like a really cool one with like a big flower on it maybe
and like some gold, some like real, just something really gaudy I think would be good.
You could just show up to the meeting,
hook your briefcase right on the side of the board table.
(both laughing)
I love that, let's do that.
Take a note.
So where was I?
Shelf up above looks to be the same wood as the desk.
So I actually kind of like that.
I think that's pretty cool.
- And it has the third Back to the Future element
that I think Andrew missed, sitting on it.
- The Marty McFly up there playing guitar.
- Oh yeah.
Yeah, no probably the most important thing in the entire back to the future story the thing that makes it possible
I'm sure DeLorean know a flux capacitor where
Where you see oh, I thought that was an empty figurine box
Okay, pretty sure it's a flux capacitor. Yeah, I kind of see the little thing the little y-shape. Yeah. Yeah, cuz it's got like
Kind of diamond diamond label. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, totally. Yeah, I think you're right that yeah
But I think what happened here was the desk didn't fit in the room
So he chopped off like a foot and a half on one side and said boom. That's a shelf now
That's just good engineering right there
And the last thing I would just say is there
Often in his podcast he talks about how much he doesn't play games
Yet there is so many game controllers and PlayStation things and Nintendo switch things like there's just game stuff everywhere
And I just wish that he had a little more time to play games. I feel bad about that
What else do we have here? I think that was I mean he elevates his pens like he's got no room for his pens
True. There's a notebook. He had to throw the notebook in there to make sure we knew he was a notebook guy
Notebook guys. Oh, there's a TV over there. Okay, maybe all the game stuff is to the left. Well, geez
That could be okay overall. I don't really have
Too much of a problem here.
Desk speakers.
That's interesting.
You don't see that a lot these days.
Desk speakers.
Do you?
That's how you know he's a serious gamer.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Huh.
Is it?
I'm just guessing.
Desk speakers.
What's that white thing underneath the monitor?
Little circle.
I think his workplace has provided that as a means of occupancy testing to make sure that he doesn't leave his desk between the hours of 8 and 5 p.m.
It's like a train driver.
You gotta push the button every few seconds to prove that you're still awake.
It lights up and you gotta push it within like two seconds or else they dock your pay.
Yeah, I think that's one of the numbers in Lost.
It's like that.
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.
Wow.
How did I know Martin would know that?
I had a sense that you would be able to answer that.
I diligently entered the numbers in that old Mac OS X dashboard widget whenever the computer
started screaming at me.
This is like the eighth time I think that has come up and he's gotten it every time.
Pretty sure. All right. Yeah. Push the button.
What do you got for this? Oh, also no chair. People tend to remove chairs and that
I wish they would leave the chairs because I'm always curious what their chair situation is.
Yeah. I mean, you covered pretty much everything. I think he's obviously a dead pool fan.
He elevates his stationary. He's into succulents, assuming that those are real plants.
- They are not, those are IKEA plants.
(laughs)
- IKEA plants.
- I'm gonna call it out right now,
those are all fake plants and they're all IKEA plants.
- Yeah, we've got some of those plants at work.
- I think, despite what Andrew said
about the whole dusting issue,
I feel like Rob is probably a diligent duster
because at least for this photo, everything's very orderly
and the attention paid to the cables
hanging nicely wrapped up from the wall, you do you Rob,
I'm impressed that you're obviously keeping this so clean.
I think what I'd like a bit more detail about,
maybe he has mentioned this somewhere,
but I don't know if it's a greeting card
that just has this on the front,
but he appears to be running his own eye tests
on the wall with a flipped eye test.
For people who can't see this
or wanna look at the show notes or the artwork
to see what we're talking about,
it's like when the letters get smaller and smaller.
And I think he's kind of doing this for himself
in his own study, but tilting his head to the side.
- Can I give you what I think might be happening here?
- Sure. - What?
I believe every morning when he enters this room, he does this eye test to purposefully be able to train his eyes to see little tiny fonts because that monitor is so far away.
If he doesn't constantly train his eyes to see tiny, tiny fonts, the monitor will become useless.
Martin, I'm sorry to butt in on your commentary there, but you just raised the issue of the cables.
One of those cables, why is the cable Batman?
Yeah, it looks like it has a cape.
Yeah, the one on the far right.
I'm cable.
Maybe it's maybe it's a Batman cable.
You don't know.
There's the bat phone.
It's the bat cable.
You connect the bat phone to the wall.
You got to use the bat cable.
It's like when you see Val Kilmer in Batman forever, having his little utility
belt or shooting stuff like that cable.
That's what it is.
It's just yeah, he swings with it.
It's like a backup one in case something happens to the to your cable.
You got a backup cable.
And how do you know it belongs to you unless it has a little cape on it?
I think everything Batman owns has a tiny cape on it, probably.
I like to think that anyway.
His knife and fork have capes.
His socks have capes, like little...
Off the back.
So when he's running, they just kind of flap behind him.
Even his cape has a cape.
His cape has tiny capes on it, yeah.
Well, there you go.
Thank you, Rob, with two Bs.
That's something signed next to the out of time number plate.
So I know we're about to move on, but it's like signed.
Is it like the Beatles with signatures on it or something?
It's probably not the Beatles, but you can see it.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Four figures in black with.
Does look like the beat does look like the Beatles or is it?
Is it the Matrix?
We'll leave that for him to answer.
I think we've covered the desk.
He's going to have to chime in on that one.
Oh, he also, Rob, just behind your headphones,
It looks like you may have a baking dish you probably a cake is done.
Oh tiny oh well it is like I said if that's a gaming PC I bet he can cook cakes on top of it.
Yeah that's cool get an hour of gaming in when you're done you got a cake.
Yeah go ahead with your quitting the internet.
Where am I quitting the internet was that.
I'm deactivated my LinkedIn profile. - Oh my canyon.blog yes.
Yes my free form is so great because I can just clip that chuck it in there and we're good to go. - It's brilliant.
Yes the final countdown hurdle in my destruction of social like social media sucks let's all face it and it's been sucking more and more for some time.
And so I gotten rid of Facebook who knows how long ago I got rid of Reddit when they did the whole.
API charging thing and I couldn't use what's that called already forgotten the good one Apollo Apollo yeah couldn't use Apollo so now read it's dead to me.
Twitter well that's dead to me because it's not even Twitter anymore so that's gone Instagram is like I couldn't deal with the ads in the garbage gone.
And the tracking didn't like the tracking gone much rather just use flickr or something like that
the last
domino standing was that
corporate necessity
LinkedIn
And the other day I had a little moment. I was like
This LinkedIn ever actually helped has it ever
Delivered me a job. Has it ever helped really improve my business networking?
The answer was no it was just it's just a complete
Virtue signaling piece of cesspool of garbage and
I deactivated my LinkedIn profile
Deleted the app and I haven't looked back. It has helped my mental health
Getting rid of all this stuff. It's given me time back in the day
It's making me feel better
I'm actually at the same time. I've been following less news and politics as well just to try and also purge some
External influences from my life and it's really good
So now the only thing I've still got going if you want to call it social media is my credit blog
Which is more just a series of websites and people. Yeah, it's not really social media. It's got no ads and
Mona which is mastodon, which I just occasionally
Scroll through but with no compulsion and it also has no ads and no monetization
And so it's just sometimes what if you feel like you're interested in that and it's just been it's just brought fun back to the Internet
There's not so much performance side of things. It's not like people playing for likes and clicks
It's not trying to sell stuff and it's just lovely
So I just wanted to say anybody who's on the fence about social media
Just try getting rid of it for a while and seeing how you go the first couple of days
you might be like sort of habit habit clicking looking for an app to just
doom scroll through but get past that and
Life is good
That's what I've got to say about that
I think you missed the obvious answer which was you didn't subscribe to LinkedIn premium digit. That's where you get the result
They did try and sell me on that a few times actually
Really? I'm surprised that they would try to push that.
If on your Windows PC you hit shift control Windows L.
Yes.
It just launches LinkedIn for you. It's built right in.
Incredible.
What are you gonna do with that shortcut now?
Synergy.
Geez.
Now, so I guess I'm not the business guy anymore. If I've gotten rid of LinkedIn, who am I really?
You know, you got your spreadsheet.
That's Weasley's way.
Sounds like you're probably pretty, yeah.
How many dollars per week and you can call it right out?
I think you're probably OK.
I'm glad you got rid of things that made you not happy.
That sounds like a win.
I just think we keep on to this stuff out of FOMO and compulsion and like, oh, you kind of like, oh, you have to have a LinkedIn profile.
You freaking don't.
Just get rid of it.
So Andrew, would it be helpful to you if I took screenshots of what I see on LinkedIn and posted on Mastodon tagging you and I don't include alt text?
Would that be good?
You're going to get in trouble with so many people if you do that, especially the alt text thing.
I'll say it was your idea.
Really helpful.
I do not want to see what people have done to bring together the organization to strategize and, you know, create.
You said deactivate. That makes me think your account still exists.
Yeah, well, try deleting it. It's like, how do you do that?
So I went with the deactivation and I was like, I'll get around to deleting it later.
Probably a mistake.
But it was also like there was still a slight, because I've had a LinkedIn profile forever.
There was still a tiny bit of fear of like, what if I do need this?
So I went the deactivation and if I ever get around to,
my worry is that to delete it,
I'll have to log back in again.
And so, I don't know.
So it's deactivated.
I assume that means nobody can really see me,
but how true that is, who knows?
- No idea.
- You know what happens the moment you log back
and it'll be like, "Hi, Andrew,
would you like to write a post telling everyone
about how you're back and notify all of your connections?"
It's like, "No."
So at the moment you add a skill and it's like,
"Would you like to tell everyone that you tried origami?"
- There's probably a sabbatical template
that pops up.
(laughing)
- Yeah.
- Well, good.
I'm happy that you're happy.
- Congratulations.
- Yes.
No, it's good.
You guys should do it too.
Actually, Martin, you probably can't.
We'll make it,
make it change your account and become fart and meld.
- That would be really helpful.
Thank you, Andrew.
- I think that would really advance your
career and paycheck probably.
(laughing)
- I'll put spoonerisms in my LinkedIn skills.
Anybody ever said that before to you?
Fart and melt?
That's great.
Fart and melt.
That's kind of great.
What do you think?
Do you not think he's gotten that for the last, his entire life?
He's easily gotten that.
The only person who ever called me that was my sister, who has been on this very show.
Oh, there you go.
That's good.
Oh, and you're a basin jerk.
This is great.
Wow.
I'm pretty sure.
Didn't we say basin jerk?
Probably.
He'd do that all the time, surely.
That's that actually literally has never happened other than you. That's way better than Fountain Mel's
Mine sucks, but yours is really good. What would I be? I'd be
Kendrew Onion
Yeah, that's crap but you're too boring to even make fun of that's that's the cat that's even worse though
Cuz then you feel bad that people don't even pick on you
Whatever you say, Bison
Don't think you all have this but I wanted to bring it up. Anyway
red box is a
It's like a little kiosk thingy that you would find like out of various shops
And you can pick out movies and you get like a blu-ray and you can like watch it for however long. I
Just read I'm very late to the game here
I just started this red box thing and I'm very confused by it for
Or let me tell you how this goes,
and you can tell me what you think of this.
So you go up to the little kiosk.
It's got generally like the newest movies
that are on Blu-ray.
Great, okay.
You pick a movie, and then you,
their thing is like you basically rent it for like a night,
and then you just go chuck it back
in the thing the next day.
So to rent a Blu-ray for one night,
usually it's about two to three dollars.
That's pretty good.
But you can buy the movies as well.
The same exact one that comes out of the machine, you can just say I'd rather buy it.
And almost always to buy it, it's like $3.99.
And like the first time I saw it, I was like, "That has to be a mistake."
So I bought it because like I either buy it or I got to go take it back.
No, it's just like that's the thing.
You buy the Blu-ray for four bucks.
And I don't understand how this is a system that works at all for anyone, because where
else are you going to get a Blu-ray for four bucks?
I don't understand.
Like we said earlier, you've got to find the loophole.
And this is my new loophole.
I go around to Redboxes now and I just buy Blu-rays for $4, rip them, put them into my
Plex library, and it's all good.
So you'll notice that in the Plex channel, I will be adding a lot of movies going forward
because this is my new system.
- That movie John Wick Chapter Four?
- I just added that today.
- I saw that.
- I had been noticing that.
- John Wick Four, $4.
Toy Story Four, $4.
Cocoa, $4.
What the hell?
And now, here's the next thing I'm gonna do.
We all have all these Blu-rays now
that I, what the hell do I need them for?
I ripped them all.
I'm gonna start putting them in packages
that go out to people that join One Prime Plus.
So now you're gonna get stickers
and like probably a random Blu-ray.
So everybody wins.
- Are Blu-rays region protected like DVDs used to be?
- Um, I don't know.
That's a great question.
I probably, I mean,
there used to be like the region one through six or whatever.
I don't know if Blu-rays are,
I don't recall seeing regions on them, but maybe.
- I remember seeing one of those red box vending machines
when I was in the US and I think we do have them here.
They're not red box,
but I think I've seen them in shopping centers.
- Yeah, some other kind of like the same thing,
but it's probably called something else.
- Yeah, which was, it's extra confusing
'cause I always assumed that it was like a Netflix thing.
'Cause Netflix is red, they do DVDs or used to
and the box, it was called Red Box,
like it seemed like it would be the same one.
No, completely different thing.
So, and then they also have streaming apparently,
but I'm off streaming now, I hate streaming.
I'm not renting anything from streaming ever again.
I'm only getting media and keeping a copy of it.
That's maybe for another show,
But yeah, it's like you look at the pricing,
it's like rent it $3,
just straight up have the Blu-ray $4,
or stream it $20.
What the hell are you doing?
This doesn't make any sense.
Anyway, if you have a red box around you
and you wanna load up your Plex library, go for it.
And you can just buy them and just have them.
It's very weird.
- I don't understand the business model.
- I don't either.
But I've got a stack of Blu-rays now.
- Just a fun fact.
I've never used a Blu-ray.
- Really?
- Truly.
- Yeah, I have no Blu-ray, well, I have the drive
that I use to rip them, but I don't have anything
in the house that could actually play one.
- The first time I got a Blu-ray player,
I think I bought an Xbox.
I think that's a Blu-ray player.
- I think so, yeah.
- But I've never tried it.
- Same as me.
And the only Blu-ray that I've ever bought
and still haven't put into it is Metropolis.
So yeah.
- You should rip it and put it on your plaques.
- Wow, that'd be good.
And then I can post about it so you can see it.
And you brought up One Prime Plus, Jason.
So listeners, keep an eye out for a Hemisfeldic news
before the end of the month.
There'll also be new audio content
and quick shout out to our newest One Prime Plus member
through Supercast, Jared B.
- Jared B.
- Thank you for joining One Prime Plus.
- Jared, I don't think you've sent an address yet.
I don't believe.
If you would like stickers
and probably a random Blu-ray at this point,
what other podcasts are you joining
and getting random Blu-rays from a red box.
That's just value right there.
- That's really been the missing piece
of the whole membership scheme.
- I think we just solved podcasting right there.
Like all this value for value, no, screw that.
Random Blu-rays showing up at your house.
That is the new model for the new era of podcasting.
- Barrett Jay, thank you for your service.
- Jesus Christ.
- OnePlimePrust.com.
It's in good time and 3.
I think that is officially we're done because it's 30 degrees hot.
Yeah I'm dying right my son just came in here and he's he's just farted in my study.
And three two one stop
