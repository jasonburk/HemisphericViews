Hi, I'm Andrew.
And I'm Jason.
And I'm Martin.
This is Hemispheric Views.
[theme music]
Surprise, surprise.
Episode 65 is not normal.
Remember the good old days when every show was reliable?
It was like your rock.
You knew what you were getting into.
You'd show up, there would be the same three people,
maybe a fourth person, that would be nice.
But no, that's not where we're at.
If you remember a little ways back,
Andrew decided, you know what?
I'm gonna just not show up one of the weeks
that we're gonna record.
I'm gonna go on a little family holiday, as always.
And if we recall back almost two years ago,
one of the stipulations, really a blood contract
that we had, is that every episode would have
all three people every time or else dot, dot, dot.
That was in the contract.
So we have Andrew leave for an entire episode,
leaving Martin and I to just fend for ourselves.
And it was okay.
We thought, you know, we're gonna say,
we're gonna allow one.
We're gonna, one time, we're gonna allow someone to be gone.
So then the next recording comes around, and what happens?
Martin decides he's gonna not be here.
So now we've got two shows out of whack,
and now we've got, not only that,
we've got a guest on the show today,
so at least we're back to three, the magical three.
But the only reason I'm gonna allow this to slide
from Martin's perspective is,
generally, I am outnumbered every single week.
Two southern, one northern, every time.
The tables have turned.
We now have our special guest, Mr.
Scotty Jackson, who is, I will point out specifically, Northern Hemisphere.
So now we're 2v1.
What do you think of that, Andrew?
Um, well, I invited Scotty in the initial instance, so it's my own fault.
So I can't really complain.
I am excited to be back with full fidelity microphones.
This is exciting, rather than my dodgy X-Mouth 3G experience.
We've gone even more Northern Hemisphere.
Scotty Jackson, welcome to Hemispheric Views.
Where exactly are you located?
- Well, thank you very much for having me.
And it's true that the tables have turned
from a hemispheric balance perspective,
but from a Commonwealth nation perspective,
we're still, yeah, I know, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
Jason, because I am joining live from my isolation room
in Alberta, Canada, which is in the,
for those not familiar with Canadian geography,
it's in the Mountain Time Zone,
just one province to the right of the West Coast
and Vancouver area, which would be the biggest,
the biggest like internationally known
metropolitan area of Canada from where I am, I suppose.
- Classic Trojan horse, see?
See what happens?
I think I'm being given a gift.
I bring the gift in, bunch of little soldiers come out
and take over my whole village.
So, isn't that great?
- That's right.
The queen's image on all the bills.
(upbeat music)
- Scotty Jackson, why did Andrew bring you here?
What was the, I guess I'll ask Andrew first.
What made you even think to reach out to Scotty to have him graciously join us today to chat about stuff?
I guess I have actually been secretly stalking. We don't use the word stalking, do we?
I think that's probably out of favor. Yeah, maybe just, um...
Befriending from afar.
There you go.
The Canadian comes out already. Look at that. Just already rephrasing all of your bad Australianisms. So, perfect.
So that's where our countries do different Canadians immensely polite Australians just a bunch of assholes
It's very true. Yes. I followed Scotty for longer than he probably realizes on his website
He has a really nice blog where he talks about his various
Adventures in shortcuts and other bits and pieces and so I've been reading that blog for a long time
I've also listened to his podcast on and off
nested folders. Sorry to steal your thunder there, but I've been so I've sort of known
Scotty as being this guy out there in the world that does interesting things.
But more recently, I readopted the application agenda. Now, Jason, you know, my my ins and outs
with note taking apps, right? Oh, do we ever. I have a long, long story history about that.
But agenda I'm finding really helpful at the moment for specifically for work stuff.
And Scotty has developed these amazing shortcuts that integrate OmniFocus, which I love, Agenda, Calendars, the whole shebang.
And so, and I reached out with a couple of questions for him on his blog, he replied back, and we got back and forth and then away it went.
And so I don't want to steal all Scotty's thunder, so that's how I discovered him.
But yeah, over to Scotty to maybe talk about what those shortcuts actually do.
And a bit more, he might want to say.
I mean, that's how I became a hemispherian, truly.
I mean, from then Andrew reaching out and then me discovering this podcast.
And I asked Andrew, like, what's the best like beginner episode for like an onboarding experience?
And he suggested the episode Old Mate, which was a great choice, because he said, like,
maybe you'd like to guest. And I'm always a little bit circumspect, because, you know,
you never know what you're being invited to, necessarily. You don't want to show up to
a room and all of a sudden there's, you know, a whole bunch of goat's blood everywhere,
You've been asked to bring a cup and you didn't know why.
So I needed to do some field research.
And so I listened to that episode.
And it was about like eight minutes in.
And I pulled over and I emailed Andrew.
I said, "Okay, well, I will be on the show, but only if we can do an episode that's at
least eight hours long and we're all just best friends at the end."
Because listening to the three of you together was just, that was fantastic.
And that's, to me, that's the magic of what podcasts are for is there's content, but it's
the personalities and the people that you show up for and hang in with.
Well, thank you.
That's super kind of you to say that, by the way.
That's very generous.
I love meeting new folks and discovering new stuff.
So thank you very much for this.
As far as shortcuts go, I mean, I am a super nerd in that, you know, I've had a computer
in my home since I was pre-kindergarten.
So I've been online in some form or fashion since the late 80s.
But I've never been a developer.
So I understand how technology can be helpful and wonderful.
I love exploring new things and I am excited
by technology being useful to me
instead of me serving technology,
which is what a lot of learning DOS
and living in a Windows environment felt like
for many years.
And so when workflow came out,
I thought like, this is my jam
because now I can just drag and drop visual boxes
and I can fill in the blank
and I can string together actions.
I understand like some of the principles
of coding and scripting.
So to get like a Lego version of that
just sung to my heart,
'cause I thought now I can do the stuff
that I always wish I could do,
but I don't have to learn AppleScript or JavaScript
or superscript or--
- Was workflow in iOS your first intro
into this kind of thing,
or did it start earlier back in your Windows days,
or was it more of a like automator Mac type scenario?
What was kind of the jumping off point?
- I mean, my biggest jumping off point,
like being like super honest,
well, I wrote basic in grade school
as a way of like doing science projects
and stuff like that as I would write little text games
or so on in basic, in DOS.
And then that gave me enough fundamental platform
for me to learn MIRC script for the IRC client, MIRC.
- Nice. - For those, for all,
shout out to all my FNET friends from the 90s.
(laughing)
- Absolutely, yeah.
I have a very strong love for producing electronic music
and ambient sounds and so on.
There was an app, and I believe it still exists,
from a company called Native Instruments, called Reaktor.
And Reaktor is like a whole bunch of visual blocks
that you chain together to make sound.
So it's almost like scripting sound by saying,
"Okay, well, I'm gonna take a waveform,
"then I'm gonna shape it like this.
I'm going to modulate it like that.
I'm going to amplify it and distort it.
And all of these different things chain together.
So I would build reactor instruments, which is again, a very similar sort of thing.
I never got into automator.
I got my first Mac in, in 2005.
I never got into automator.
I think the UI just sort of put me off a little bit.
It just.
It still had that kind of Lego building block sort of approach in there, but it,
it just seemed a little more, little more programmery,
if that's a word.
- Yeah, in general, the Aqua interface was something
that I think I tolerated more so than enjoyed.
The design language of the Apple OSs of modern day
are very, feel very natural to me as the kind of person
who when I need to sort out my head,
I will like grab a piece of paper, write something at the top, underline it, and then just start
writing a whole bunch of stuff down.
And apps today, I feel very paperish in that regard, and that the UI kind of gets out of
your way a lot more.
Whereas in that era, the UI was very heavy and very intrusive and structured.
- That's the first time, I just want to pick up on that.
It's probably the first time I've ever heard anybody say, and don't take this the wrong
Scotty, that they prefer the new look of - you often hear people referring back to the good
old days of the lickable Aqua interface and all that kind of stuff and how beautiful it was
and how apparent it was when something was a button and when it wasn't and that kind of stuff.
You're probably the first person I've ever heard who said, "No, I actually prefer
the new stuff." I just find that really interesting. I'm not asking you to justify
that in any sense, it's just an observation. I feel like you have to explain it less, like it
feels more natural to me, like if I was to wireframe or sketch out a user experience on a
piece of paper, I feel like that would look more like a modern web or app experience, whereas those
other ones before were like, yeah, it's very clear what a button is, but that also for my mom, now
that seems like, "Oh, that's a big button. I don't know. That seems scary." You know what I mean?
Like it almost feels like threatening in the weight of its UI presence. I know that a lot
of people are very nostalgic for the bubble gum, Bondi blue apples of yesteryear, but maybe that's
just because they got their Apple tattoos too early. And-
I feel like there's two things about that. One, we were in such a transitional period in terms
of what computers could even do, that design of interfaces somewhat had a very heavy influence
from the fact that we can do this now. So let's go ahead and do it to show how powerful these
machines are. Whereas nowadays, power is basically unlimited. So that's not a thing anymore. And I do
feel like there is that, that concept of being in a place and in a time so that today you look back
and go, "Oh, it was so much better,"
when you flash back to that time,
people bitched and moaned just as much back then
about the things as they do now.
They only really remember those positive, fun parts of it.
So I think technology being at a kind of growth point
in its evolution, being able to create
a lot of these interfaces was more so the reason
then we needed it to look like that.
It's like we can make it look like that.
And it's not DOS anymore.
It's this big, boisterous, big blue buttons and stuff
because we can do it, so let's do it.
And I think that's where a lot of,
I at least feel like that's where
a good portion of that came from.
- That's probably very true.
I think the other element of that is that
in that era, there is a very sort of monopolist space
for each kind of category of app, right?
Like, so if you had a word processor,
because you didn't have a notes app in those days,
you would have a word processor.
And that was going to be either Microsoft Word or Clarus
Works, or if you were a holdout weirdo,
maybe you're still using Lotus.
Sorry.
I'm not judging anybody.
That was probably Andrew.
I'm trying to be funny as a Canadian,
and now I have to apologize.
And that's it.
That's all there was to it.
And so we were slaves to those UIs.
We had to learn how those worked.
Now you bring up Agenda, Andrew, which of course I'm
a giant fan of.
But you can have this note-taking app
that serves its community of a hundred users.
And you can have hundreds of different notes apps
that all approach note taking
and the UI of note composition entirely differently.
You don't have to be that one app
that serves all the people for that vertical of thing.
You can approach it in your way
and have enough users to get by as a developer
or a software company.
And that's fine too.
So I think that also opens up the door to a lot of creativity and approach if you don't feel like you have to be the app that is selling millions of copies.
Yeah.
And we mentioned Agenda again there, just for people who may not know, Agenda is like a note-taking app that's inherently linked to calendar events.
So it sort of breaks things down into projects and ties back to calendar events.
It's quite clever in the way it works.
Some people either get it entirely or they are entirely befuddled by it.
So it's kind of like Scotty says, it's sort of everything has an audience.
Um, but I'm just wondering, have, has, have the agenda developers
reached out to you at all?
We've chatted on an, on a number of different occasions.
I I'm in the very early days of nested folders.
They were kind enough to sponsor an episode where we experimented very
lightly with, with, with sponsorship.
We did, we we've done two different sponsor.
we wanted to be very selective about how we did that.
And so we've been sponsored by Devon Think
and by Agenda, which are two apps that we both,
Rosemary Orchard, who is my co-host and I,
both have a lot of affinity for.
- This podcast just got longer.
I'm sorry, Devon Think as well.
- Here we go.
- There we go.
What we're gonna need, I think, is to start a spreadsheet.
- Oh, and then you mentioned spreadsheets.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, like it's over.
I'll just leave you two.
I'll put myself on mute.
Go ahead.
- I had to do that.
I felt like spreadsheets were gonna get underrepresented.
I've had a chance to chat with them
on a couple of occasions.
We've talked about how different shortcuts I'm making work.
They've been kind enough to extend their URL scheme
based on some of the suggestions that I've made about,
gee, it would be really cool if we could do X.
And they've been very, very kind in listening.
- I'm not an Agenda user,
so I obviously have not used your shortcuts for Agenda.
I'm curious if they are,
are your shortcuts more about
just strictly automating things that exist in Agenda already
or are you more in the realm of sort of prototyping,
call it a feature if you will,
things that maybe could be done
that you're just doing via shortcuts
versus something that's built into the app,
or maybe it's a combination of both?
- I would say that my shortcuts spend the most
of their horsepower on making the wine,
and then agenda happens to be the goblet.
What a lot of my shortcuts do is look into
the various different realms of content that I have stored,
whether that's in calendar events or tasks,
gather all of that up, format it into some readable text,
and then plonk it into Agenda as formatted markdown.
I could easily adapt my shortcuts to, you know,
do a lot of the things that they do.
And then the end result of the text ends up instead
in something like drafts or IA writer or day one
or some other pages.
- Devon thing.
- Devon thing.
We could save it as a text file.
- Or CSV into a spreadsheet.
- That would be ideal.
And then you can also log the time that you spent
on that on a per item basis.
And then what you do is you then take that spreadsheet
and you export it and you bring it around to your friends,
Martin, Andrew and Jason,
and you have them analyze it on a podcast.
And Jason is absolutely delighted the entire time.
- Yeah, absolutely.
The more spreadsheets, the better.
- Yeah, if we could definitely add in more of the CSVs,
that would be fantastic.
Can I do real talk on shortcuts for a second?
Because Scottie, you are all about shortcuts
and you're very good at making them.
Andrew's using your shortcuts.
I wanna play the other side of shortcuts for a second here,
if I could, and just say that
I love what shortcuts represent.
I love the accessibility that it lends
to the average person to be able to build and construct
almost applications to some degree
without having any programming knowledge
like you alluded to earlier, right?
Where you don't have to know any bit of Swift code
or Objective-C or anything, or even scripting languages
to be able to build a shortcut.
And I think that's super great.
The issue that I consistently run up against,
and I'm curious, but I feel like I end up
falling into this realm of I spend more time
trying to keep them working from version to version
and then I do getting any real benefit from it.
So it's like I have fun making it,
but then I fall into this sort of,
I'm just gonna go back and just do whatever
the apps normally let me do.
- No, you're not wrong at all.
I think that's where you have to be very careful
about what is worth spending time automating.
Like I think when you start thinking about shortcuts
as an application or as a platform or as an opportunity,
your instinct is to open up the app and say,
"Okay, cool, well then let me build a shortcut,"
which I think is unfortunately backwards.
I think what you need to do first
is run into some sort of problem or realization of,
"Geez, I keep doing this thing over and over again.
Oh, maybe I'll open up shortcuts
and see what I can do about that."
- Hey, Scotty, I just wanna change gears
just a little bit with a sort of almost a concluding question but um one that is
not exactly shortcuts related. I was talking to my wife a dedicated listener
of Hemisphere Reviews and I was explaining that I was gonna be speaking
with you and she was like yeah shortcuts whatever I don't even know what you're
talking about. But her question was she said to me how do you find these people
All right, and I said, well, I don't know.
I don't know.
But he's like, Scotty's known around the community.
I feel like you're known.
And she suggested, can you ask the question,
like, how do you become known?
Like, you've got your podcast, you've got your blog,
you're doing all this stuff.
And how do you become known in this community?
How do you reach out and achieve this broader awareness
in the Apple community?
Because that was something she was saying.
How do you-- like, all these people out there doing
things. How do they all build an audience? And it was an interesting question because
she was curious to know about you and your background. And it's the same challenge I
think we have as well at Atmospheric Views. We're talking about this stuff. How do you
get the word out? It seems like you've been somewhat successful in that.
If you've ever been to a work conference, like one of those vendor-hosted conferences
that is not in your city. You have flown to this vendor-hosted conference and all of the people
in the room have a shared interest in something, but you know nobody.
Step one is figure out who your best friend at this conference is going to be.
And you hang out with that person and you say, "You're now my best friend,
and we're going to just sort of roam around, and you're going to introduce me to the people
that you might know by some sort of couple of degrees of separation and I'll do the same.
And we're just, we're gonna kind of work together like that. And I would say, I mean,
the ugly version of that, I suppose, is like writing someone's coattails. But like, I,
but I mean, but it's kind of true, right? Like start with one and say like, you're my pal now.
And then share. I think just to share willingly. I think there's a lot of desire to be like,
"My time and my content is worth something. I should get paid for it." And that is not wrong,
but I don't think anyone is going to give money to someone that they've never heard of,
or buy stuff from someone who is previously unpublished. And so, I just started sharing
all my stuff and I didn't expect anything anything for it and over time
got introduced to Matthew Castiglioni who was like on the marketing team for
workflow and then left after Apple acquired them and is like the preeminent
shortcuts guy and and Christopher Lally who is a YouTube producer and and makes
all kinds of wonderful YouTube content and is very keen on shortcuts.
I'm just getting, I'm getting word in.
I'm actually getting news that Martin has given us a little something.
He's given us a recording like I did last week on my business corner, Lean
Manufacturing, which was fantastic by the way, everybody should listen to that.
Martin has contributed something.
So I think we may have to jump over to that.
Jason, have you got that ready, queued up and ready to go?
Fortunately or unfortunately, I do.
It's ready to go.
I'm terrified.
More-- I don't know if I'm more terrified to hear what he has
to say versus what you had to say.
I pretty well know you in terms of what
you were going to go after.
And it was going to be something provocatively amazing.
Did I characterize that correctly?
Yeah.
Yes.
It was lean manufacturing.
I hope your laundry is in much better working order than it was.
Yeah, I, I, fortunately we do chapters here, so I just skipped that chapter,
but I bet it was like really good. So I applaud everyone who made it through that.
All right, we'll go to Martin in three, two, one.
The editors of Hemispheric Views wish to advise that the following segment
contains both crude humor and adult themes. You have been warned.
[sobbing]
Hello, it's Martin Feld, currently absent from the rest of the podcast. I do apologise for that.
Family commitment came up, but I'm here now and I'm going to be road testing
a new segment just with you called Storytime with Feld.
[music]
And it may be something that we revisit in future when I'm back in the
makeshift digital studio with Andrew and Jason, but we'll see how it goes today.
And the premise is simple. I'm going to be telling you a story or stories in each story time with
Feld. This first one is going to be a bit of a weird experiment. I'm going to be telling you
three very quick stories. Two of them will be true. They did happen to me or I was involved
with them. And one of them will be false. It didn't happen to me. Now, I don't recall if I've
I've told Andrew and Jason any of these stories before, and I'm pretty sure I've certainly
told family or family has been involved. So maybe they're exempt or they shouldn't participate
in this. But for all of you other listeners out there, once I've told them, you'll be
able to go to our Hemispheric Views discord to the hashtag show talk channel. And there
will be a poll there for you to vote which one wasn't true, which one did not happen
to me, even though I told you here on storytime with Feld that it was true. So I'm going to be
telling each one by one. And at the end, you can go there and vote. And next time on the podcast,
I will reveal which one did not really happen to me. Right, let's kick it off.
So the first story involves a birthday of mine years ago, right, but younger. And I decided,
"You know what? I want to go go-karting on my birthday. We'll go with my uncle and my dad.
They are interested and two other friends." Now my birthday is in summer so it does get quite hot,
but you never know. It can cool down a little bit. So we decided to go go-karting and I was feeling a
little bit motion sick on the way up because I don't do terribly well as a passenger if I don't
have good visibility, but generally driving, no worries, it's fine. Well this time was quite a
a different story because even though I had gone go-karting before, hence my interest to go on my
birthday, it was so warm and I was so affected by the fumes that I started to feel a bit unwell.
I'm going round and round and round, seemed generally fine but it just gets worse, it gets
hotter, the fumes are there, it's like sticky, I feel sticky inside my helmet and it's just
bad news and then all of a sudden going around a particular corner it hits me. Bang. Gigantic
vomit explosion out of my mouth covers all of the inside of the visor in my face and the helmet
and it's just I'm just soaked in chunder. I'm sorry that this is a really bad image for all
of you just imagining spewed but this is just the way that it went. Got out everyone's thinking how
on earth does someone vomit inside their own helmet when they're driving? Well I managed to
pull it off. If you mix the right amount of general passenger motion sickness with extreme summer heat
and carbon monoxide. That's what you get. I spewed in my helmet on my birthday.
That brings us to story number two. Now, for everyone who's been listening to this podcast
for a while, you would have gathered that I'm a fairly extroverted person. I'm comfortable
talking to people at length, whether it's on a podcast or trapping them in person at any retail
situation. There was a time, though, when I was less comfortable, in fact, somewhat anxious about
talking to larger groups of people, particularly strangers. And that became identified by the
family. I've had, I kind of owned up to the fact that I was a bit anxious about it. So they decided
to sign me up for a program, which at the time was a bit mysterious, and they didn't tell me
what it was. Looking back on that now, it seems a bit ridiculous, because you've got this anxious
teenager who wants to resolve an issue. So what do you do, you sign them up for a program where
where they don't know what's involved.
Anyway, cutting to the point,
it involved going to a bus stop locally in Wollongong
and meeting an instructor there
and a small group of other people
who also needed some sort of help
with their general nervousness or anxiety.
I got there and there was this instructor
with her clipboard and a couple of other people showed up,
someone close to my age, teenage years,
and a few older people, middle-aged I'd say.
And she said, "Look, what we're gonna be doing today
"is we're going to be exposing you to the idea
that if you embarrass yourself in public, there will be no repercussions. So we're going to get
on the bus and we're going to sit in different seats. And what you're going to do is as we drive,
you'll each be assigned a bus stop and you will stand up and shout it without warning
as you approach so people know to get off. And we said, are you kidding? We're not doing this.
And she said, look, it seems a bit unorthodox, but we're going to do it.
So we all nervously got on. I was assigned to Church Street in Wollongong. And as Church Street
came up, I had to muster up the courage with a person sitting next to me to stand up and
yell "Church Street!" before Church Street was actually reached by the bus. And I had
to do this and I learned, "Wow, this is actually okay. It's not that bad." Went away, came
back for a follow-up, and there were a few of these, but one that particularly stuck
with me and was very embarrassing, and the person who almost lusted at me on the bus
was I actually had to go up, and we each did this,
we actually had to go up to someone
who was sitting by themselves in one of the bus seats
and say to them, "Can I please sit there?"
This bus could have been totally empty,
and it was empty for a few of us,
walk up and say, "I want that seat,"
and just see if they would get up and do it.
The person I went up to was not so obliging
and actually got the major shits with me,
so I actually had to sheepishly walk away.
But over time, doing different things,
and we actually went beyond transport,
the situation improved.
So I'd like to think that I'm a little bit more talkative
with strangers now because of that ridiculous program,
but I'm not sure that it would work for everyone.
(upbeat music)
That brings us to the third and final story
of story time with Feld.
And this one also involves transport,
but it's from a later time in my life.
When I was commuting to and from Sydney,
I did the train all the way for a while,
didn't like it after a bit, so I thought, you know what,
I'm gonna do this kind of mixed mode thing.
I'm gonna drive halfway, get out,
walk to a station in a place called Sutherland,
and then, which is in South Sydney,
and then take the train the rest of the way up.
Well, one evening when I was doing the reverse,
going back home, I was on the train
and I was on the way to Sutherland,
and we stopped at a station called Hurstville.
And on stumbled this woman
while I was sitting in the vestibule,
I didn't wanna go up to the other seats.
She came up to me and she said, "Oh, how are you going?"
And I just responded, "Oh, not bad."
And I didn't really know the person,
but she spoke with a kind of familiarity.
And then I worked out, "Ah, this is a bit of a shame.
She seems kind of alcohol or drug affected."
But she was perfectly friendly,
just wanted to kind of show me photos
on her phone of her dogs.
And I was like, "Okay, no worries."
So we're sitting there and time's kind of going slowly.
I really wanna get to the station and just go home.
I just wanna get in my car and drive home.
but this talk just keeps going forever.
And she's showing me pictures of a dog over and over again,
telling me her family and life story and all this stuff.
And she's really not with it.
She seems kind of a bit spacey,
but then all of a sudden something weird happens.
She makes this kind of like groaning noise.
And then she leans back, she's wearing this dress
and she actually, I kid you not,
projectile urinates across the vestibule
such that it is hitting the seat opposite us.
And I've gone, "Whoa, what the hell is going on?"
So I leapt up, backed away, and she was super apologetic.
And I said, "No, no, that's fine, but are you all right?"
'Cause I just didn't wanna get hit by urine.
And then she was just kind of in a daze and said,
"No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm so sorry."
And she was really apologetic.
And she said, "I understand if you don't wanna sit here."
And I said, "I might just move."
She seemed fine, but I didn't wanna move.
And then all of a sudden,
the train is going up this slight incline on the rail.
It's this slight hill.
and all of the urine on the floor starts to cascade down towards the steps
and I have to like jump, hoping not to get splashed as she's like in this daze.
I confirm she was alright, but that is a particularly traumatising urine-related public transport incident that I will never forget
and now hopefully is burnt into your minds as well.

So, that brings us to the end of Storytime with Feld.
I hope you enjoyed those three stories. Good luck deciding which one out of those three
did not in fact happen to me. Thank you for your time. Catch you soon.
There's Martin. Okay, that was great. Thanks, Martin.
Yeah.
Thank you, Martin. That was- Oh my- Wow. Can you-
That was- Scotty, you still with us or are you blown away?
Where do you even begin? I mean, there's a lot to unpack here. So, I think- I mean,
Can I come back for the next four episodes so that we could do a series?
It feels like this could be an adjacent kind of side series probably, right? To really
unpack what just happened. Oh my gosh, a limited run.
This could be One Prime Plus material. We haven't even mentioned.
Oh. Have you heard the good word?
Yeah, Scotty, do you know the good word? Do you know the good word, Scotty, about OnePrimePlus.com?
It's in the long game. No, Scotty has no idea. He's looking at us stunned.
No, I do. I mean, as a registered hemispherian - as a registered? Conscripted?
We require everyone to register, absolutely. We know where you are at all times.
As a hemispherian, I am familiar with oneprimeplus.com, absolutely.
So, One Prime Plus, I would like to give a shout out to our newest
One Prime Plus member extraordinaire.
Patrick C. is now part of the One Prime Plus dot com community,
which is always thank we're thankful for that.
Always. We love having you on board.
You have this is now the point in the show.

So thank you all to the OnePrimePlus members,
especially Patrick C,
who is the newest member of OnePrimePlus.com.
- And Patrick C, this is throwing,
I haven't appropriately doxxed Patrick C as of yet,
but I've got so many like questions
flying around in my head because as you know,
sometimes we have comments on the names
of our new OnePrimePlusians.
Patrick C, now my surname is Canyon with a C.
I have a sibling, a brother, whose first name is Patrick.
- Ooh.
- So I've got questions as, is this my brother?
- Could be. - But then,
my brother in all my life has never willingly given me money
so it doesn't check out.
- Can I add one extra piece of One Prime Plus knowledge?
Can I drop on you real quick?
- Sure, do it.
- I have been playing with Dolly, that weird AI image thing,
like probably an unhealthy amount in the last month
where you like type in random crap
and it makes up images out of some kind of artificial
something or other, whatever.
I'm obsessed with it.
What I would like to do, being that I have access to this,
is I would like for all OnePrimePlus members
to submit the most bonkers phrase
or thing you can think of within reason,
because it does have some legal things around it,
but keep that in mind.
Submit your phrase.
I will input it into the Magic Dolly 2 system
and spit out four artificial images
created out of your phrase and send them to you
via your whatever method you want,
email, Discord, whatever.
But I'm obsessed with this Dolly thing.
I don't know, Scotty, have you seen some of the stuff
coming out of this Dolly 2 thing?
- Yeah, I've seen a couple of the,
like people using it for generating avatars
or something like that.
I don't know if it's the same one,
but I'm very curious about what role
these kinds of very advanced content creating AIs
could play and how they could be used.
I'm very curious to see how this,
see I've got a research assignment.
- I can tell you the two biggest uses
I see them for right now are creating,
just like you said, creating your kind of profile image
for a social media application,
or creating really weird cover art for a album for a band.
It does those two so well.
For instance, I did one that was a simple one,
a cat wearing a hoodie while hacking into a computer.
And it made four of my favorite images I've ever seen.
So, you know, submit your phrases,
I will put them into the magical machine
and they will spit out the other end
with something amazing and everyone will be
the better for it.
So that is the end of oneprimeplus.com.

- In the summer times,
in the summer times I used to stay with my grandma
for a couple of weeks and she had three channels.
And on the Saturday I would be so excited
to wake up for cartoons, like finally a show for me.
And I would get up but it would be too early
And I would have to stare at color bars until the color bars went away.
And then the national anthem was played and then it was time for my shows.
And I mean, yeah, it's, it's, it's a whole, a whole new world.
Scotty being Canadian, you actually might be able to help me out with this.
And this is related.
A little while ago, I went searching back through various streaming services,
various backs of trucks looking for a show called a Canadian show.
This is where the link is.
You can't do that on television.
Do you remember this show?
It was, uh, it was like a kid's, like a tween, teenager-y kids show.
And they used, they used to throw slime on people and they had like a
chef who was really disgusting.
He made like, yeah.
Barth.
Barth.
His name was Barth.
Thank you.
You do know what I'm talking about.
Barth's burgers.
Absolutely. I mean, that show actually produced a lot of like young talent grew up.
Alanis Morissette was on that show among others.
We used to get it on ABC, a sort of public broadcaster over here in Australia. And I loved
it when I was a kid. And I wanted to watch it and I wanted to show my kids what we used to watch in
the 80s. But I can't find it anywhere. I'm wondering, is it still available in Canada?
YouTube? No, I don't think so. But I mean, I would hunt YouTube for it. But it had a very
sort of Monty Python-esque opening with like that style of like cutout animation
of like people going through a factory and being built. And yeah, if you said,
I don't know, you got slimed. Yes.
Because you said water, you had water dumped on you. And they had like this row of like school
lockers and one of them would open the door and call for another one and then they would open
their door and say, yeah. And then they would do like back and forth jokes and,
oh, I remember that show very well. That was classic.
So, Jason, we now have a Canadian Hemisphere Reviews embassy. We've just established an
outpost. It sounds like it, yeah. I think that's great.
Absolutely. You just, you present your credentials at the door and we'll, we've got all of the
amenities already all set up for all Canadian and traveling hemispherians right here in Canada.
I've been to Canada, I think three times. So I think that should at least give me a little bit
of credibility. I've been to Australia zero times. So already shows you where my alliance is. And I'm
sure it has nothing to do with the fact that we're attached. That's clearly, that's irrelevant.
the drivability difference is palpable. Yes, Australia shall attach to no one. We are an
independent nation. Just with a little bit of English thrown in that we can't seem to get rid
of. Well, on the Australian being up on a pedestal as usual, let's end it there. Thank you, Scotty.
I would love for you to list out the many places, even though I think we've covered a lot, but let's
Let's get it all into one nice tight chunk at the end of where folks can get a hold of
you, find your shortcuts, listen to your podcasts, and any other cool things you're doing on
the internet these days.
- Sure, thanks you guys so much for having me.
This has been an absolute riot.
I can be found on the internet at heyscottyj.com or by the same name on Twitter, heyscottyj.
You can find the podcast, nestedfolderspodcast.com
that I do with Rosemary Orchard.
There are not all the ways, that's it.
Those are the only ways.
(laughing)
- He's like, that's it, folks.
(upbeat music)
- Well, I'll work on you and I'll get you
on micro.blog someday, but--
- You know what I need is I need my best friend
at the micro.blog conference, and I think I found them.
And so if you'll hold my hand and show me around,
and then we can make great content together.
