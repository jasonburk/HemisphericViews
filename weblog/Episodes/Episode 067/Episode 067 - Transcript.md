(upbeat music)
- Andrew is really worried today
because he's in the capital city
of the Northern Territory of Australia, Darwin,
for a baseball competition.
- Yes, tell us, how is the World Series of Australia going?
- Oh my goodness, it's so frustrating doing a podcast
with you guys sometimes.
What's wrong?
Basketball.
Let's clarify this is basketball.
Right?
It is the National Basketball League.
The one with the clubs.
Well, there's 10 clubs here.
If you call that 10 organizations, one of them, the Wollongong Hawks, who I will be seeing to play tonight.
I believe that's the Illawarra Hawks, but I could be wrong.
Oh, yeah, it is too.
See, they've confused me because they've changed their names like three times.
Some seasons they're Wollongong, some seasons they're Illawarra.
They have an identity crisis.
So they're playing tonight.
Last night I saw Perth play and basically, yeah, all 10 teams of the league are here
in Darwin to play a pre-season tournament.
And I am here on behalf of NBL Pocket Podcast with media accreditation,
Attending all the games trying to basically make a bit of a nuisance of myself through the through the tournament trying to talk to players if I can and ginger just generally be a reporter at large.
So do you have like a fancy badge that you get to walk around with and all that.
Do you have got a lanyard media on it it does.
Wow awesome.
And special colors blue, which means I'm media.
- Yeah.
- So people can choose to engage with me or not.
- What are all the normies?
What's their color?
Just walking around average Joe.
- I've noticed purple and red.
I think purple might be the one you really want.
That's like restricted.
You can go anywhere you want.
You just wander around entirely, but it's pretty cool.
I'm still able to wander around pretty well.
If you wanna know what I'm up to,
you can follow me on Twitter
because I'm absolutely avalanching it.
- He is. - Have you guys noticed?
- Yeah, if there's like a limit on how many tweets you can send,
I'm not sure if there is, but I bet you're probably hitting it pretty regularly.
- I saw Andrew Canyon trending across the Southern Hemisphere for sure.
- Yeah. - And look,
now while we make fun of you, that is pretty impressive. And it's cool that you've flown
there with this official accreditation. So hats off to you. And because you have a blue lanyard,
I hope you're wearing your blue Southern Hemisphere shirt to go with it.
I don't think I packed the Southern Hemisphere one, but I did pack the hemispheric views
Northern Times Southern
Mmm, so that is gonna come out. Okay, one of these days maybe tonight. I mean the crossover is huge between
Basketball and whatever it is we do here. So yeah, it's um
Look, I have it's it's been hard to communicate. What is
Hemispheric views to the basketball people. I seem to have more success with the wrestling crossover at the moment
Ah, okay. Well, that makes sense.
Well, good luck.
Bunch of people running around at each other with two by fours.
That seems fitting for us.
But, um, yeah, the other thing I just want to say, Darwin, if anybody's, this is like,
this is the great, wonderful thing of the Australian continent is it's freaking
massive.
So I've left Perth.
It was wet, cold, rainy, pretty miserable.
Had the hoodie on, had the, wearing the jeans, get on a plane for two and a half,
three hours.
Get out. And suddenly I'm in the tropics. You step out of the airplane and it's hot and it's humid.
And the hoodie has to come off.
You know, I'm getting sweat where I don't want sweat to turn up.
Man, Australia is just a totally different place up here.
Suddenly I've got to think about crocodiles.
You know, I've got to think about all sorts of bugs.
There's different plants.
The little house I'm staying in has bananas growing in the backyard.
It's just a totally different world.
Are you going to include some photos in the show notes of those sweaty spots for our listeners?
Or?
I don't think anybody's that interested.
Okay.
I think they'd like to see the bananas. I feel like that's going to be the highlight,
really, of the trip.
I'll take some photos of bananas.
Okay, perfect.
Banana for scale, you know, isn't it?
Yeah.
I think we always want to do that.
Yeah, obviously. Yep. Very fitting for the, again, for this show.
Thank you for the Darwin report. We've not had one of those previously, so I'm glad that we're able to
Get in a little bit more of the continent into the show thank you for that.
Yeah you're welcome so it's like for Americans it's like Florida I guess I would have to say.
But at the wrong end like equatorial but on the north bit it's kind of flipped.
Yeah and there's less crazy old people here actually there's still crazy old people they're just crazy in different way.
I don't know I think they just got another one.
I love generalisations like that I think you're right Jason.
So yeah, that's that's basketball update. Love it. I'm so glad we're able to get that in
Can I kind of transition us into something that I think is pretty similar to basketball but enough
Dissimilar to get us away from it entirely. Um
Unannounced trivia corner. Yes, you heard it here
It's never in the unannounced trivia corner
No, it's not in the notes because then it would be announced and that's something entirely different.
Are you ready?
No.
No, but go.
Perfect. Question one. In what year was Officeworks founded? 1987, 2002, 1994, or 1991?
Oh, this is a good question.
I'm going to say 1991.
Okay.
because, and I'm not super confident, but I think I've seen enough photos of things historically in
Australia that show like, oh, you know, coals or woolies back in the day or other chains,
particularly David Jones or DJs, but Officeworks, I don't think so. So I'm going to say
that it's only slightly older than I am. 91. Got it. Okay. You're locked in for 1991.
Andrew this this I felt like this was a gimme for you, but I guess we'll we'll see. Yeah, I'm disappointed
I don't just know this off the top of my head
This is an area of weakness for me, which I've identified now work on it should be in a spreadsheet
We'll work on self-improvement. This is not good enough, but I do remember well, I know
Whereas Martin knows from photos that it wasn't around in the olden days. I was around in the olden days and
There were no office works
When Andrew was a boy and I think Bunnings was really the first big box you know.
Company they they went let's go big box let's change it up and then they thought well if we can do it for hardware we can do it for other product categories and then hence office works and it was.
Open by West farmers same company right.
Is he doing a is he doing an online search while he's doing this long rambling thing.
I didn't really ask for the entire history of office works really just the year would be sufficient.
Because West Farm is an amazing Western show the inconglomerate.
I need a clock from now on apparently there's going to be like a.
Whenever you speak the little chess ones.
1994.
OK OK he finally found the internet search that he was looking for perfect.
But I love that he just ditched the whole transition to the answer he just abort I'm just gonna say a number so we don't know where that was going.
No no we don't know and frankly we probably didn't have time for it.
I'll record my own my own 10 minute session later.
Question 2 because there's always 2.
- Two questions.
- Two questions.
- Sorry, that was our discord pop.
- Thank you equator.
What is the tagline of Shapes Biscuits?
Everyone knows shapes, love them, right?
So A, they're great.
B, flavor you can see.
C, infinite possibilities.
Or D, tastes like it feels.
I know what it is, but are we allowed to go for the same answer if we know it?
We've done that before, right?
Yeah, I think it's legit.
Yeah, I think, I mean, if I wouldn't want someone to answer wrong just so it's
different.
All right, Andrew, I think we both know what it is, but you can go first.
Andrew, go ahead.
Well, we know what it is, but before the options were presented, I had in my head
the idea, oh, it's baked, not fries, not fried, baked, not fried.
That's also on the box.
Yeah, but it's, but it's, it's actually a flavor you can see.
Okay, same answer for me. Yeah, but they're not fried
They make almost a bigger deal of it sometimes because you know, who's frying a biscuit in Australia
Anyway, I know biscuits are different in the US and you'd probably fry anything but no one fries a biscuit here
Yeah, even if it was okay, let's say it's cracker or biscuit either one
Sure, whichever you pick like we have the same thing where there's this baked not fried thing
I'm like when were these ever fried? I don't understand. I don't know happening
I don't know. - There's huge competition between the In a Biscuit brand and the Shapes brand.
- I can see that. - Like there's chicken in a biscuit, in a biscuit.
That's, you know. And so In a Biscuit versus Shapes is highly competitive.
- I didn't actually know there were other In a Biscuits. I just thought chicken in a
biscuit was a thing and... - The best one, I'd say. - What else is in a... Do they have
other In a Biscuits? Like crab bisque In a Biscuit. - I think there's cheese in a
biscuit. Oh, okay. Because what's, you know, you can really put anything in a biscuit.
And then if you put cheese atop the biscuit, you get cheese-ception,
because there's layers of cheese upon the biscuit. I don't know.
I always call it chicken in a basket for some reason. I don't know why.
You have done that before. I remember that.
Yeah, I don't. I, for something in my head at some point, locked in on chicken in a basket.
And it's just been that ever since.
That's salmonella waiting to happen, just chicken sitting in a basket.
- Yeah, you don't want chicken in a basket.
That just, that sounds horrible.
- And that skin's looking mighty fine.
- Yeah, put that out in the sun.
So thank you for playing Unannounced Trivia Corner.
- Wow, I'm confident I went two for two on that one.
- Okay, good for you.
- We've got so many corners in the show.
We've got Business Corner,
we've got Unannounced Trivia Corner.
Who knows if we'll ever get to Media Corner
'cause we just meander.
I was telling you guys that we have Dutch Corner
the road unofficially with the UCI bike event in Wollongong. How many- like if we were a shape,
hence what you were just saying about shapes, how many corners would we have as a podcast?
- I like to think that it's infinite. - Wow.
- It's a, um, it's a bit- not a Bezier curve, it's the other one. It's the- what's that?
- The golden ratio. - What's that thing that flowers do,
where they curl like that? - Photosynthesis.
I don't like the Fibonacci stuff.
Yeah, I think that might be it.
Like the numbers that Fibonacci sequence that you see throughout nature.
Fibonacci sequence, but then you can get computers to do the rend- it was a big time rendering thing in the 90s.
You could- it was a big thing in the Amiga.
Of course.
And they do curls.
It's not, it's not Bezier, but it's the other one that sounds a bit like that.
And this is driving me crazy.
Huh?
No, just Stamen.
I'm just gonna throw names out there. Pasteur.
That's the one.
No, this is gonna drive me crazy.
The guy with the milk.
It's a mathematical thing. Basically, there's infinite numbers of additional
corners that you can add on so you can never actually make a circle or something.
You can torture yourself for the rest of the recording thinking about that.
Blockchain.
You guys make my brain go in strange directions.
Speaking of different directions, I would like to thank the newest
oneprimeplus.com member who has joined us. It is Leon M.
Welcome.
Thank you, Leon, for your participation in the OnePrimePlus
universe, I'm going to call it. As a reminder, oneprimeplus.com.
Can we call it cornerverse?
Sure, you could call it that. Trademark?
Cornerverse.
I think you have to say trademark after it.
- Corners.
- Corner verse trademark, registered, FDIC insured.
Anyway, thank you Leon for oneprimeplus.com,
your membership, it's much appreciated.
Don't forget to go get all of your goodies
in the One Prime Plus arena.
Newsletters, past episodes, live events.
Oh, also live events,
speaking of unannounced trivia corner,
I think we're gonna do another announced trivia corner
some point. I'm hoping before the end of the year. So, Leon, you are now welcome to join
Announced Trivia Corner. So, congratulations on that. And a just general thank you from all of us
for joining. Tell your friends. Now, very quick item of follow up. I don't know if you two remember
or if any listeners actually care, but I thought I should actually, you know, follow up on a promise
to check in on this. Sure. A year ago in episode 34, I gave the update about buying the M1 iPad Pro
with the white Magic Keyboard. And there was, I think, a brief reference, I haven't checked it
properly so listeners can correct me, but I think it was that episode about how clean my white Magic
Keyboard would look after a year. Now, it's been slightly over a year just to make sure that that
time has progressed. And I thought I'd show you two guys and include a picture in the show notes
of how white this keyboard is.
- Can we guess first?
- Yeah, you can guess crisp or filthy
or somewhere in between.
- I'm gonna say that the track pad
looks kind of like a disaster.
I'm gonna say the keys are fine,
but obviously, you know, lovingly used
'cause I think you type a lot.
- Right.
- And then the whole kind of rest of it
is gonna look pristine. - Okay. Andrew. - I'm gonna say the trackpad will have a patina of use
and you'll be able to see it'll be shiny bits in around the middle and a different color on the
edges. The home keys on the keyboard will also have a similar patina. - Right. - But everything
else will be immaculate. Like if it was any other person other than Martin, I would say this thing's
trashed. It is dirty. It is basically a gray iPad cover at the moment. But because it's Martin,
I'm saying it is like mint out of box.
Okay. Well, thank you both for your views, your hemispheric views, if you will.
I'm going to hold it up to the camera and you can do a brief commentary on it.
People can look at the show notes, maybe even the chapter artwork, and you can judge which one of
yourselves was correct. So we're going to look at the back at the moment or the top of the case.
It's so blindingly white, it just blows out the- I can't even see. It's like looking into the sun.
All right. Now, the bottom.
I love the sticker, by the way.
Thank you.
Equally the same. There's maybe just some unavoidable slight degradation, but-
Do you carry an iPad placemat everywhere you go?
He does, yeah.
All right. Now, let's look at the-
I think he lost.
I removed the iPad so you can see where it rests magnetically with the cutout.
Same.
This is a new one he just bought this he just bought another one and now the keyboard
keyboard looks fine it's hard to tell but i guarantee that trackpad's got a little weird
island in the middle because they all do it doesn't look like that does it i think the white
hides better than the gray maybe you might be right that is spotless what about hang on can
i don't know if you can do it martin a little area near the near the hinge do you mean the
actual hinge that little flat area oh yeah yeah yeah no no the flat area between the keyboard
in the hinge hmm has that got like a if you just run your finger along that is there like a layer
of dust that would just come off it spotless is that annoying both of you there you go this guy
this guy can you believe you no that that's what i would expect it to look like honestly
if it doesn't look like that you does this mean that i win the podcast i don't know if
if that's a competition, but do I win now? Sure, you can have it.
Check back in 2045 and we'll see what Martin's trackpad looks like.
The same. The same, thank you.
That is incredible. I can't believe it's been a year. That time has flown by.
I think I'm more surprised by that than the keyboard itself.
Oh, the passage of time. Yeah, when I said episode 34, both of you went,
Oh dear, what? Yeah, that was a while ago.
What is this thing? Yeah. Wow.
Just real quick for comparison. Oh God. Oh yeah.
Oh, oh, with a normal person. Oh, throw up emoji.
Oh, there's like crumbs on it. Oh, geez. I know.
Oh boy. Isn't that disgusting? That is just vile.
That's what you get for living in Western Australia.
There's like a half of a grilled cheese just in it.
How's that even possible?
We're going to have to rename it his magic jaffle, I think.
It's on the keyboard.
Isn't that what you do?
You squeeze it, you put your sandwich in and then close the cover.
Yeah, it doubles as like a panini maker.
For sure.
They used to have those lines in the jaffle makers, but you just have-
My God, that's a loud car.
But you just have like the imprints of the little home key nubbins and little squares everywhere.
I'm going to have a toasted cheese Quirty you alep.
Exactly. All right. Well, there's a fun update. And yeah, I don't think you need to see it in
future, but 2045, maybe. Yeah. We'll check it again.
We would guarantee you need to see it in 2045.
Putting it in OmniFocus now.
This is in all sincerity, I want everybody to know that they should be listening to the podcast,
really specific stories hosted by Martin Feld.
RSS.net.
Is that the URL?
No, that's absolutely wrong.
RSSpod.net.
I've done it from memory.
But thank you.
RSSpod.net.
I feel like I should have replaced the basketball on that line and maybe put mine
on there instead.
You can take over.
No, no, please, please go on.
In all like serious, no jokes, no joking around.
No, this is a great podcast.
It's so interesting to hear different perspectives of people who are either
listening to podcasts or recording podcasts themselves, talking about their
podcast journey, you know, where they first discovered them, how they engage with it.
You know, what, why it's important to them as people.
It sounds like it would be one of these really nerdy, non-interesting topics, but it almost
just provides a frame.
I mean, it's delivering an outcome in terms of Martin's research for his PhD in podcasting.
So you're getting about podcasts, but for me it's about learning about people and the
podcast stuff just provides a framework for sort of hearing how another person sees the
world and how they are as an individual.
got a very human approach. Martin is incredibly generous with his interviewing
technique. He doesn't interrupt, he gives people time and space to think and
breathe and speak and he just he steers the conversation without ever having it
feel like it's being forced to go in a direction that he wants it to go in. So
Martin does an excellent job as host, guide and all the people that are on it
are really fascinating and interesting and I hope this podcast goes on for a
long, long time and it's excellent. So please listen.
Well, I'm very flattered. That's an awesome review. Thank you, Andrew. And the difficulty
for me, as you kind of pointed out, because I am doing it as part of my research, there's
this kind of self-imposed restriction or limit to interview people who I can line up with
the case studies that I'm doing. So when you say you hope it goes on forever, maybe beyond
the project, I would love to interview basically the web, right? I would interview everyone
because everyone has an interesting story.
So I kind of have to be very careful and picky and choosy
in some ways because of the project.
But yeah, I hope that it kind of has a life beyond that.
And I've been very grateful for the people who have joined.
You two were the first,
given that this has become a case study
in a weird kind of way.
But yeah, we'll see how it goes.
And thanks to anyone who's listened.
- @rsspod.net.
(laughing)
just making sure we've all got that.
- Thanks Jason.
- I got you, here we are.
- So thanks for that.
- That's it, you're welcome.
It is very good.
Long may it continue.
- We'll contact the other one and have them redirect.
- Actually, just before we leave this topic,
it's one of those things where,
and I'm sure you two appreciate this,
maybe Andrew is thinking about it more
because he, you know, we edit the show
and Jason takes the responsibility of all the show notes,
but you realize how many times you say certain words
when you listen to yourself all the time through editing.
Now, I called the show really specific stories.
Obviously, you've probably noticed
that the initialism is RSS.
But in listening to my own voice,
when I do speak as the less occasional interjecting host,
the number of times I actually say the words really
and specific in my life is kind of terrible.
Like I didn't realize, I'm going,
oh my God, I'm not even doing it deliberately.
So if anyone has listened and they go,
He really is like, you know, heavy handed with this really specific stuff.
It's like, no, I accidentally just all the time.
Word particularly as well.
It's kind of painful.
So, sorry to anyone who noticed that.
And we all have those tics.
I know there's things I say that are terrible and I hate it and I try and break the habit.
And every time I listen back, I think, ah, damn it, I did it again.
I have a habit of speaking like there's a gigantic M-clause in every sentence.
I notice when I do transcription, I go, my God, this has gone on a meandering journey through
the countryside and come back. And the only way I can deal with this is a set of em dashes.
What do I do? That's how I speak. All right. There's our next pot for the Discord.
Yeah, just a line of em dashes. Every time Martin says something, it's just foot,
em dash, foot, em dash. And no one ever came to the chat again.
That's at Discord, by the way, the chat, if anybody is wanting to jump in there, go to
hemisphericviews.com/chat.
I hope.
If not, it'll be there before this show goes out because I will create it.
Yeah, it's our little Discord home on the web, which now apparently has forums.
I don't know.
It's 1997 again, apparently.
So yeah, jump in there, Discord, love it.
You've got mail.
Yeah, we're adding, yeah, we're going to add AOL keywords next.
That's next on our agenda.
And a thanks to Alpine for boosting our server.
Yes, yes.
Thank you for the boosts.
We appreciate it.
We do not require it.
We do not ask for it because it is a stupid system and I hate it.
But that's where we're at.
So thank you for doing that because we just...
We are grateful.
It says we want to get to level three.
We absolutely do not.
Level two is all we require.
That's all we want.
Don't care about level three.
If we're at level two already, save your boosts.
Don't worry about it.
So thank you.
(upbeat music)
- Now, Jason, I think somewhere on the internet
there was a mention of some new iPhones.
It was a pretty, you know, inferior event
considering the wall-to-wall coverage
of our deceased monarch, but go ahead.
- I haven't heard too much about it.
I think I got one in the mail.
I'm pretty sure I'm using it now.
I can show it to you.
- Not a monarch, the phone.
- No, I did not get a monarch in the phone, in the mail.
No, that did not happen.
But I can show it to you if you'd like,
if that's something you'd all like to see.
- Of course, this is a tech adjacent podcast.
- Yeah, so let me just.
- I'm confused.
In all that conversation,
sorry, did you get an iCharles or an iPhone?
- The latter.
- Okay, sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm so confused.
I went with this one here.
What?
This is the one I went with.
This is a pixel we're looking at, I think.
It's gorgeous.
Just kidding.
No, I'm kidding.
That sucks.
I got this one.
Yeah, there's nothing to say, really.
I mean, I think everybody knows what an iPhone is nowadays.
And it's great.
Surprise.
(laughing)
- Yeah, but I have a very--
- Do you have a really specific question, Martin?
- I do.
I always have a really specific question,
a particular question for you.
And that is, a while ago,
you moved from the Mini to the Pro.
I think that was the last generation.
And you had this gigantic existential crisis
about the size of the phone.
- Yeah, that's awful.
- The Mini is no longer sold as like a newer model.
They only keep some of the older ones around.
You've gone for another Pro,
from what I can see with those lenses and the size of it.
- Yeah, the 14 Pro. - Not a Pro Max.
- No. - So how are you going with this?
Have you settled back into that size
and you're dealing with it?
'Cause it is caseless, as we could see.
- Yeah, no, I refuse to use the case ever.
It's, I won't do it, not happening.
They're too big.
All the phones are too big.
It's just fact, sorry, but they are.
But that's what is offered.
So I went with the 14 Pro
I had the 13 white pro, yeah, white,
which is slightly different white.
The white is a little different, which, I mean,
I don't think anybody cares, but I found that interesting
that it wasn't just the same one.
'Cause I don't think they really,
do they call it white or is it silver?
I don't remember.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
Yeah, love the cameras.
Obviously that's like the main reason to get it.
The dynamic island thing is, I absolutely love it.
It is beyond awesomely useful and delightful.
Like it checks both boxes, absolutely.
I'm a big fan of always on screen.
I think it's cool.
I like it.
And it's just a great phone.
The update process was fine.
Everything's eSIM now, which is interesting.
- Not in Australia.
- True, yeah.
Only in the US, everything is eSIM.
Outside the US, it still has the little tray.
Yeah, so now it's dual eSIM,
which is like, that's interesting.
Whereas it like yours would be one eSIM and one physical.
- I think you could store more, but it's what's active.
- Oh, okay.
- That's allowed, I think.
- Got it.
- You could store like a travel one as a third one,
for example, I think, but it might not be active.
- Oh, but you just pick which two you want.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Do we know why is it some government regulation
as to why we still have the physical SIM
or is it the carrier say,
sorry, we don't have the infrastructure to support it?
I would guess it's some kind of like governmental thing
'cause that just, we need that,
we need as much government oversight
on our cell phones as possible, obviously,
'cause that makes sense.
So that's probably why,
but it could be a carrier thing too.
If not enough carriers support eSIM,
then that would be obviously pretty bad.
I don't know what your all eSIM situation is,
but basically, unless you're on like a very
kind of fringe carrier in the US.
I think everybody has eSIM now for the most part.
If you're on a, you know, again,
if it's not just that sort of MVNO of an MVNO,
like one of those kinds of things,
I think eSIM is basically everywhere now.
- Yep.
- But yeah, great.
I love it.
It's awesome.
I'm very excited that this whole,
like I never cared about the notch thing to begin with.
I never thought it was a big deal.
I think it was absolutely idiotic that we talked about it for as long as we did.
But I think it's brilliant the way this thing works and functions and flows and
just the, who are the, the team that worked on this?
I think you can really, it comes through very well how much
they cared about this thing kind of being almost an
alive object almost where it's sort of a living thing on the phone,
even though obviously it's not living.
So I think they did a very, very, very good job of it.
I had no issues with activation.
I know that was a whole thing people were up in arms about,
but didn't see any issues there either.
So overall great experience.
Everything is just so much better now,
transitioning from phone to phone.
Like it's just so easy.
You tap like four things, everything goes over.
My watch automatically switched over.
I didn't even have to do anything.
Used to have to like wipe the watch
and then like restore the watch afterward.
You don't have to do that crap anymore.
- Right, wow.
- It's, yeah, it was a really,
and going from physical SIM to eSIM,
it just did all of that.
It was like, do you want to transfer it?
Hit one thing and it's like, boom, you're done.
You're now on an eSIM on this phone
instead of a physical SIM on your old phone, so.
- I will just say two things.
Sorry, on the eSIM thing,
if anyone isn't using it, like the dual SIM situation,
I can second that because on my iPhone 13 mini,
I have my personal phone service as the physical SIM,
and I have my work service as the eSIM.
And just that benefit of being able to have specific contacts
ring from a certain service
or switch things for data is fantastic.
So I just wanted to second that
in case people were listening to what you were saying,
going, "Oh, what's the benefit of it?"
'Cause I'm not huge on the idea of work profiles
or different things.
I know that's easier now with those iOS 16 lock screens
and focus modes.
But to me, just the fact that you can have a different phone service
kind of switching or intermittent is great.
And on the Dynamic Island, I don't know if you two saw this,
but one of the designers, at least, if not the designer,
his name's, I might be butchering the pronunciation or the emphasis,
but Chan Karunamuni or Chan_K.
He's on Twitter and he's been tweeting
and kind of talking to people about the Dynamic Island.
So there's some good kind of demos there if you're less familiar with it.
We can include that in the show notes.
Yeah, for sure. Where are we landing? On the dynamic island.
The name? Yeah.
Not like on the port, you know, the leeward side of dynamic island, you know, not that sort of landing.
But where are we landing on the name?
I love the name. Sorry, that was a maritime joke.
I was taking it very seriously.
Oh, yes, the maritime joke.
I think it's fantastic.
I understand that people think maybe it's a bit cheesy,
but you know how, for example,
the browser on the Mac is called Safari, right?
And how they used to have a photo app called Aperture,
and you can think of other names.
I like the fact that they're calling a UI element
or some sort of product or service.
They're giving it a descriptive name
that kind of describes its whimsy or its function.
I think a lot of names have become very obvious
or too simple on the Mac.
Like there's nothing wrong with having calendar and messages and Apple followed by the name,
but everything just starts to become very generic.
The fact that they're coming up with a cool marketing name that gives an essence of its character,
I think is fantastic.
Otherwise, what would it have been?
Floating Notch or something.
I was in the running.
Yeah, it's what's that?
So I think it's great.
I think it's nice that they came up with a cool name and it gives you an idea of what it does.
does yeah I really like it I think I've said this before when people were
complaining about something else but it's like if if that's your issue is
the name of it like yeah I'd say you probably knocked it out of the park
you're doing pretty good if people are just like I don't like the name like
okay cool get over it yeah sorry okay well I'm glad you're liking your iPhone
just great nice yeah next show I'll talk I'll talk watches next show oh I was
I was going to say, did you get anything else that may have just answered the question?
I got the Apple Watch, but it doesn't, it was a two week, it was weird.
That one you could order day of, but it wasn't shipping and landing until two weeks later,
whereas the phone wasn't pre-order until that Friday, but then was available one week later.
So it was this sort of interesting time change, but that'll be next week.
the following show, I'll have something to say about that. Because people want to know. I mean,
you know, inquiring minds want to know what the probably number one tech adjacent Australian/American
podcast had to say about these hard-hitting matters.
Well, that's right. And so, Jason, I mean, not Jason, Martin, did you spend any money?
Did you give any money to Apple?
No. And look, I'd happily have any of these things, but, you know, I have
recent products and have spent on other things for the past year. So, a sensible relaxation period is due, I think.
I think that's smart. Yeah, that's a good choice.
Yeah, I had the same approach. I went through the reality distortion field and I wanted to throw my iPhone 13 mini in the trash and get an iPhone Pro gigantic.
Like a Max?
But then I realised, yeah, like the biggest one.
Oh, God.
You know, you would have been unhappy though. You would have been, you would have got it.
It would have been, oh, this is gigantic. And now my life is ruined or something.
I can't even imagine going from a mini to a max. Like that is...
I know. So I went through a cooling off period and I just thought, no, just sit this one out.
Good.
You don't need it.
Yeah. I mean, the mini, I love the mini and I'm sticking with that for as, you know, long as I
can as a size. I wish they would maybe bring it back in the future, but I would happily go back
to the mid-size kind of pro phone, but it would be wonderful if they could maybe not use steel.
I know that people were writing that titanium could be not.
No, I love steel.
No, steel looks beautiful. Steel is great. It's just more about the weight of it
that I'm talking about. If they can make it lighter.
The last thing I'll say is that I complain about how the phones are too big and the 14 Pro is
technically a little tiny bit bigger than the 13 Pro.
It's like, you couldn't even keep it the same.
It's just a little bit bigger.
- That's right.
- And the back thing is like,
I think the camera cluster is the size of an iPhone mini now.
- It looks like the size of an Apple Watch, to be honest,
at least the smaller one.
- It is, let's see.
If we go, yeah, that's-
- Yeah, it's big.
- It's the size of a big Apple Watch.
- It's like bigger than my watch.
- Yeah, it is massive.
- And just as we're talking about this,
my mom has sent a message that's coming on the display
saying, "Oh, my watch just shipped, thank you."
So there we go,
live update from One Prime Plus Hemispherian, Tanya F.
- I can't wait to hear her feedback in the Discord.
- Excellent.
- Recently in Discord,
there was some chatter about this agenda thing
that Andrew uses, Scotty was on the show.
He's a big proponent of that.
David, I think was talking about it on discord.
Is there anything there in terms of shortcuts, updates for agenda?
Cause I really think people are looking for that.
It's funny.
You should mention that.
I'm, I'm really loving agenda at the moment for managing my work.
I'm using it to manage my Darwin trip guys.
I've got an agenda note for each game.
I'm taking notes into it.
But yeah, it's um, Scotty just keeps pumping out these shortcuts, and I just wanted to bring
people's attention to it. Basically you can create a script, you can use his scripts,
and it creates daily notes that just um, link back to OmniFocus. So you can, you can check it off in
Agenda, and it will automatically check it off in OmniFocus. You can, you can have like little
quick logging, so you could say, you know, rapid logging bullet style. So I have like a little
thing sitting in my dock, I can just click it and then I am suddenly can write a quick note
and it will go into the agenda note for that day. And optionally, it can also be put through to
OmniFocus so you can create a task. This is all through the power of shortcuts. And I just thought
It's really fantastic. It's it makes a really fluid approach to um
Tracking your tasks and work stuff and all that kind of stuff, and I'm really happy with how it's going
So I thank Scotty for that the one value add that I have also delivered
with it is
Using my stream deck. I finally found a really positive use for my stream deck that so often sits there, and I forget about it
But now I've got whole rows of button over about buttons lined up for the different
shortcut triggers. And so I push that and it goes via Stream Deck to Keyboard Maestro
to the Shortcuts app, which sounds convoluted, probably is, but it works. And
you know, pops up on my screen, I can make a note and it all gets put into Agenda,
OmniFocus, tied back to calendars and all that kind of stuff. So if you're at all
interested in automation, it's a really - it's achievable, don't be daunted by it.
If you're interested in agenda if you're interested in shortcuts automation
This is a good way to get started into it and Scotty has done all the hard work
Like if you look at the script, I just look at and go Wow
Like I could never program that myself, but he's done a great job. So thanks Scotty. I believe there is a
shortcuts
Stream deck app now so you can just bypass some of that middle stuff. Ah, okay
I think there is a shortcuts thing where you can just trigger shortcuts directly from buttons and not have to do that like middle
Tie together stuff. So yeah convenient. I mean if it's working it's working. But yeah
Yeah, if you ever if you have if stuff starts like
Not going through the whole chain. I think that does exist now
Well, that's good because you don't want to have to buy keyboard maestro just to be a middleman. No
That's overkill. So that's a good solution
But yeah, I just wanted to say that you know following up on that that stuff that it's been updated
So there's all new versions nice. So make sure you're running the latest version, which is awesome. Thank you Scotty
That's great
Because I know a lot of times especially myself included we create these shortcut thingies and then never touch them again
And they basically break like a week later and then people find them and go this doesn't work and I'm like, yeah
It's because I'm terrible. Sorry, so he's not terrible and he actually maintains these and keeps them going
So thank you, Scotty.
- Sorry, I don't have a lot to add
and I'm not a huge shortcuts user,
but I have to say that my favorite shortcut,
super simple is, and I don't know if everyone knows this,
but you can pop it in your menu bar on macOS, go down.
I go launch HV, everything pops up for the recording.
Why wouldn't you do something like that
if you have a multi-window experience that you need?
So that's my one shortcuts contribution.
Just make app launching easier.
It's lovely.
- Yeah.
That's handy.
That's your turbo tip for the day. - That's it. That's all I've got.
- And that is short corner, short corners, shortcut corners, something. Cutting corners.
- Well, actually, you know what it would be? It would be a desire line or a desire path,
which is what you take as a shortcut through a predefined corner on a footpath.
- Look for that in the show notes. - That's the Stanford experiment.
- There you go. So the shortcut is actually cutting through the corner.
Wow, gotcha. There you go. You don't pa- yeah, you don't pave it until the people walk there, right?
Because you always end up with that bit of dead grass that everyone's walked along.
It's all coming together.
