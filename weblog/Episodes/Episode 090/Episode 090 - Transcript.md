Martin Dean do you know about it do you know about a twiggy stick.
Yes the euphemism for pig on the tube.
Oh ok that's a little more descriptive than what I heard previous to this conversation I call them meat sticks.
Yeah meat sticks.
Ok I was eating this it's it's a Carolina Reaper meat stick are you familiar with the Carolina Reaper.
No is that like the grim reaper but from one of the Carolinas it's a pepper it's one of those peppers that's like.
Unhumanly hot kind of things really like grow them just to be hot it's cool it's delicious so if I start coughing or like turn super red or just fall over and die.
During the recording you will know why.
So not just as we were just as we're waiting to get set up here that I hit Jason with two really early Australian isms and he wasn't ready for it so I wasn't no I called it I called his meat stick at tweaky stick.
You know what the food right yeah I'm so Jason's me yeah yeah yes yes yeah I didn't turn the camera on too early.
It's a twiggy stick okay but then I was also talking about his hair because his hair is looking a bit bed head ish this morning or this evening for him.
Yeah, it's kind of could be styled could be off a pillow. I don't know. That's that's exactly what I'm going for
You just don't know. I said Jason. You got a lucky band in that hair and
He had no idea what I was talking about
No, I thought he said lackey like I was lazy. I thought he said lucky like I don't know what that is either
turns out lackey is actually
Australian for elastic because it's too long of a word so we had to hack it up
And we landed at lackey and honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if it were lackey ban like BAN like the D was even too much
That's how we say it. Yeah, like yeah lackey - ban. Okay. I think most Australians would just go
Oh, you're one of those
Actually what we don't we actually don't say bad. We just say a lackey. You just got a lackey. There you go
You don't bother with band I don't think I've ever personally used that term actually and I don't mean that to dispute it
I just mean, you know, I'm obviously some weirdo from New South Wales and I don't match
Boys great job with the episode last week
Thank you last not not last week two weeks ago last fortnight two weeks ago. We do it every two weeks
I'm not sure if you're new here, but
Yeah
It's been a while. I forgot how to plug my microphone in so
Good job
So yeah, I really enjoyed listening to the show last time it was great good job
So did you listen I always wonder this
I've never not been on a show and I'm not saying that to disparage you. I'm just saying that as a fact
Did you listen?
To it when it was in the folder
previous to going up or
Do you wait until it actually hits and I'm making an assumption here that you actually are subscribed to the show
That it goes into your podcast player of choice at which point you listen to it
I as much as this will upset Martin many times I
Prefer to wait for the official public release before listening to it because I know that I should do like check
But I trust Martin's editing so I don't need to review what he's done. Thank you. I like the surprise
I like getting it when everybody else does and just wondering what has been crafted and
And particularly last week, absolutely,
'cause I had no idea what was said.
So it was like being a listener of my own show.
I really enjoyed it.
I waited to the public release.
- Okay.
And you know that I listened to it 100%
through every time anyway at 1X because I'm not a monster.
- I listened to our own show at 1.3X.
- Wow.
- Because I sound smarter when I speak a little faster.
(laughs)
- See, it's interesting you bring that up
I know there are people out there who listen at faster than one times and that's up to them. And
some podcasts that I listen to through Overcast particularly, I will have,
you know, maybe smart speeds, smart speed turned on. But I'll be honest,
the amount of time that I spend personally editing, even the pauses, like for timing,
I don't, I mean, I don't lose sleep over it. I'm not offended if people want to listen to it faster,
that's fine. Do not.
The interesting thing is that if you actually listen to it with zero algorithmic smart speed
interference or otherwise, like hours are spent actually lining up.
It's perfect. It's literally perfect. It's literally perfect. It's literally perfect.
It's literally perfect.
Thank you. I don't need to be told that, although I'm happy to take it.
But like arranging if we speak over each other to have boom, boom, boom for a joke, like that's maybe what you're missing.
If I'll change my settings because I feel like I've just been I feel like my dad said, you know, in trouble, Andrew, I'm not.
I'm just disappointed.
I'm disappointed.
No, because I know for a fact that listeners would enjoy it the way they want.
So I don't judge or feel any offense at all.
And it is funny because I know Jason has said that he doesn't like,
I think you said Jason, how it actually speeds up our theme music.
And it's possible that people are out there.
It ruins the theme music.
It absolutely butchers everything to do with a podcast.
Anything that's not 1X.
But mainly the transitions, right?
Everything.
I think it ruins the entire show.
In natural conversation, you have pauses.
You have tones, you have moods.
This just strips it all out and makes it robotic and terrible.
It should be listened in the way in which it was created.
And that is it.
Wow.
Okay.
So who do you feel like you were told off by more, Andrew?
You, Martin.
Oh, come on.
I'm screaming at him.
You said like one thing and he's like, I'm very, very hurt by that.
Jason just express a personal opinion whereas I felt like you were looking down at my eyes and just saying
Andrew do better
Now that I'm back I can reassert control over this show
Yeah, reassert control. I have because I look in the show notes and I realized that it's basketballs all the way down now either
I am that domineering or you guys are just getting super lazy about show notes. What's the story?
Well, let's be clear here. There are pre show notes and there are show notes. Oh, sorry
So I just want to make the distinction that those are two different things
Or the run sheet if you will run sheet. Yes, the run sheet is dominated by basketballs. You were gone. We missed you
We wanted you to fill it up
That's exactly right. You missed out last time. So lead the way and you're editing. So it's the double whammy. You can just yeah
Now when it goes three hours, you have no one to blame but yourself
And also you put in things last week that we had no idea about and just talked about him anyway
Now you're here you can actually talk about your own topics so cool
All right, let me start with the top. Let me start with this topic that is about starting
Recently I have started a new job
bum-bum-bum
right
I'm curious
It's been a long time since I've started like a real fresh new job at a fresh new place, new people.
Are you okay sharing what that length would be?
Probably about, well, in terms of a new job, like a...
Like a new place, not like a new position or like a different place.
So it's weird.
It's the 70s, right?
So I changed place about three years ago.
Shut up, Martin.
Not even the 80s and 90s just straight up the 70s.
Wow.
Screw you.
This is going to be a good one.
We're only nine minutes in.
Come on, I know you're not that old.
This is already getting spicy.
I thought my meat stick was spicy.
This is really going somewhere.
Go ahead.
Every time we start a recording, I think, "I'm going to be nice this time," but then I just
like stirring him up, even though he knows that I'm not serious.
It's just too much fun.
Yeah, yeah.
He cuts.
So I started a new place three years ago, but it was essentially the same job and I was working with the same people because we all moved place.
It's a long story.
So I'm not counting that.
So before that, I was at the same place for about 11 years.
So this is probably realistically, if we're talking new place, totally like all fresh, don't know what the heck's going on.
It's probably like close to 14 years.
Wow, pretty nuts.
Because like 10 years I feel like is a, that's like a work lifetime I feel like.
Yeah.
I mean you can have multiples of those, but the 10 year mark feels like a real, like okay, this is like a good portion of my life at this point.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I've started a new job, all new, and I'm well out of practice and I'm much older than I was when I last did it.
And, you know, it comes with more seniority
because you get older and you get removed to jobs
that are more senior.
So my question to you guys who perhaps have started
new jobs more recently than myself,
is where do you draw the line between balancing,
learning the new job and fitting in and getting the culture
and understanding all that,
versus just getting in there and starting to do stuff,
change stuff, assert yourself and make things happen.
Where is your threshold for that differential?
- I think Jason started a job more recently than I did.
So do you wanna go first, fresh guy?
- Sure, yeah, absolutely.
I think there's a big question that you have to start out
with the kind of forks that conversation
in terms of how big is the company?
Is it a 10,000 person global behemoth?
- No, negative.
- Or is it like a 50 person startup-y kind of thing?
I think that matters a lot.
- Somewhere in the middle.
- Okay, and I also think it matters a lot
if the area you're going into,
if you are already quote unquote an expert in that area
versus like a new, like you're changing everything,
new company, new role.
Like I used to be in engineering,
now I'm in marketing or like, you know, something like that.
So I think both of those things matter a lot.
But let's say you're going like from similar size company
to similar size company,
similar-ish role to similar-ish role, give or take,
like no role is ever the same,
business to business, that's just the way it is.
But I feel like in the larger companies,
you're gonna take longer, not because you want to,
but because the system is so broken,
you have to take longer just to figure it out
and understand why X is connected to B
instead of X is connected to Y,
because reasons that have been there
since three generations of workers before you.
So there's that.
Whereas I feel like with the smaller companies,
if you're coming in as sort of that expertise,
I think it's almost expected that you're gonna come in
and just get to it.
We brought you here because you're employee 11,
because we need to get from zero to 100 now.
So you're expected to just change stuff, move stuff,
do whatever you want to get it done.
But in the larger one, maybe that works,
but in my experience, that's generally never been
the right way to do things.
You think you're gonna come in and just change the world,
but it's like, oh, by the way,
there's 50 layers of bureaucracy and stuff
that you have to deal with.
So I think you're probably,
I'm gonna say conservatively three months
of just lay of the land,
alliances, issues that existed before you got there
that you wanna make sure you're aware of.
At least three months is my long-winded answer.
- It's a good answer, thank you.
Martin, do you have any insights?
As a youngster who's probably just finished
work experience stint. That's true, actually all I've done for years is just take coffee orders
and most of the time I'm wrong. You don't do photocopying anymore do you? What's a photocopier?
It's a good return on his serve of the 70s comment. I like where this is going.
Yeah exactly. Yeah we're not talking about the facsimile are we?
So I've been in my current job for just over five years, been really enjoying it. I've learned a lot,
a lot of really good people and kind of challenged me in ways that were unexpected, but then also
fit in with the skills and interests that I have. So I feel it's been a really good balance.
What I'm going to say won't really apply to everyone because I think it depends on your
level of introversion or extroversion, how reserved you are, maybe even the type of work
that you do, but I work in communication and that requires, surprise, surprise, communicating.
So when I started my job, I saw the learning and the doing and the meeting people as all
pretty much the same thing.
If you're doing something that's much more, I don't want to say isolated, but focused
on doing something with data or where you don't need to communicate with people, you're
probably going to be wading through a lot of information to try to understand things
before you apply knowledge or practice something. In my position, and this might just be my
personality or bias, in order to learn things I had to start doing and meeting people. Because
if you're going to communicate things or work with social media platforms or try to talk to others,
you can't do that unless you start meeting people. So for me, the learning was who's who,
what's this, what does that terminology mean, who do I have to get in touch with to actually start
doing stuff. So I think if you're in that sort of role where you have to be constantly
interfacing with other humans, you can't view them as separate tasks. You actually have to
put yourself out there, get access to stuff and tell people who you are so that you can do your
job. And look, there's some level of anxiety or nervousness with that. When I started my job,
I was like, what am I doing? This is a bigger place than what I'm used to. But you settle in,
you learn who's who and what's what and you get into the groove of the whole thing. So
I think if you can have a balance of both learning and doing that's ideal.
Yeah one of the things I've noticed in this job so far is that I haven't been able to hold back.
I've just had to assert myself at times and like think this is why you know ask the question why
are we doing it this way? Shouldn't it be done this other way? And I already feel like I'm
actively doing stuff and it's kind of a good feeling. So yeah, I'm enjoying it.
And you shouldn't be afraid of changing things. You don't want to be viewed as,
"Who's this new person who just wants to suddenly change everything that we've been doing? What do
they know?" But then you also don't want to completely retract and never offer anything
because they go, "Why did we hire this person?" So I think it's a matter of asking questions and
showing interest and then based on that inquisitive or curious communication with people, people go,
"Oh, he or she or they actually asked the question
and tried to find out,
and now their suggestion to change something
is actually based on some form of consultation."
So change immediately is great
if you've actually asked some questions.
- Question everything, analyze, and then selectively change.
- Oh, that's good.
That could be a blog post.
I like that.
(upbeat music)
I have another question that stems from this last one.
So this is a job in which I am having to be somewhere.
Again, it's been a long time since I've had to be
at a location at a time in the morning,
like physically present.
This has reminded me and brought to my attention.
I've never been a morning person.
I really have a hard time getting up out of bed
in the morning.
And I am having to decide, you know,
I'm having to get up, I'm having to make lunch for myself,
get prepared, get dressed, get in the car,
all timed out so that I arrive at a location
at a certain time.
I don't like it, okay?
I gotta be honest, I don't like it.
But it's quite another question for you guys.
I don't jump out of bed in the morning.
I struggle to get up.
It's like snooze, I wanna snooze every time.
Do you guys jump out of bed in the morning?
like, yes, I'm ready to face the day or is every single morning at a battle of
will against yourself.
Up at 4.30 AM every day, rise and grind.
No, not even if I, I am so not, I used to be a night person.
I've never been a morning person ever other than by force.
Um, and now I'm not even really a night person either.
I'm sort of just like a few good hours here or there during the day is about where I'm at now.
Am I right in saying if you need to get up to order a product at a strange time, you can do that.
But that's about it. Yeah.
If I need to be up at 3 a.m. to like get a new whatever thing.
Yeah, I can do that.
This morning I had to do an airport drop like boom up ready to go.
- It's really mostly if it depends on doing something
for someone else, done.
Like I will do that 110%.
If it's anything to do with myself,
other than the phone ordering kind of situation,
it's probably not gonna happen.
I'll probably just say like,
"Yeah, I'd rather just get the extra sleep."
- Look, the universe is biased against morning people.
It's totally biased or biased towards morning people,
Biased against night people.
Martin, what do you do? Do you jump out of bed?
You seem like a jump out of bed kind of guy.
You're so enthusiastic about life.
Thank you. But that's after I've taken about 90 minutes to two hours to wake up as a non-morning person.
So what you're seeing is the product of hours of very slow 1980s computer style boot up procedure.
OK, so he's a morning person after two hours.
Yeah, and I agree with the whole the, let's say, late capitalist society that we're in is
bias towards morning people. I've always been someone who found that any kind of rise before
7am is not a human thing. That's not normal. And if you can do that, and I know people in my family,
friends, circle, people I work with, they can do it and I wish them all the best. I can't do it.
And since, you know, starting a family and everything and, you know, caring for a child
and rushing around and doing all these things, and then only having certain hours of the evening to
to spend with your significant other
or do other things that are hobbies or study or whatever,
that kind of pushes that bedtime even further
to fit those things into your life,
which then has this never ending cycle of,
wow, I probably look like I'm only operating at 40% today.
So I like to think that I'm never slacking
or overly exhausted because of that,
but it's like, yeah, I should probably get some more sleep.
- I find it to be so absolutely hilarious
that the people that seem so hard up for like,
get up at 4 a.m. and like, do all your stuff,
like are the kind of people that have jobs
that rely on daylight, 0%.
So it really makes no difference what time of day
they're doing anything, 'cause it's the same work
no matter what.
You're in front of a screen in a room
with artificial light, so like, yeah,
chill out maybe with that, but no, no morning.
- Yeah, but I remember getting up for school
just being like bleary-eyed and like, "I gotta eat this Vegemite toast that I made while
I watch Pokemon."
And like, "Oh, how many craters have there been in Dragon Ball Z so far?"
Now I've lost track.
They've all been like, "Oh, I gotta get to school."
That was my morning.
That sounds like the dream, but doing that at like 10 a.m. instead of 7.
It'd be great if that were all pushed to that time, actually.
I would have liked that, but, um...
Sunday morning this morning I woke up at 930 a.m. and it was glorious.
Okay next on the agenda I was looking through the back catalog of our shows
and I realized that we are actually tech adjacent so the next item on my agenda
for today is tech adjacent. I can't remember if I've already said this as
well this might have already been a topic I didn't search the show notes
Really well I have I saw this next point in when this is very interesting and I look forward to picking a bone with Andrew so go on.
Oh are we doing bone picking.
I'll be a mom think of the smallest bone in the body it's like part of a phalange or something it's a very one thing bone picking corner.
Okay, what you got.
Apple pages there's a little conversation on mastodon that I noted this morning.
About pages that app here another one between our friend after and johnny decimal.
Who is I would say is I'm hoping to arrange to be a future guest on a show just my life has been crazy recently he's a great to it in principle we just haven't found out the details my fault not his.
Johnny decimal and John Gruber having a conversation about pages.
And I couldn't help but chime in because I recently used pages to write a report for a consulting gig I did paid consulting gig I used pages rather than Microsoft word.
Pages was really good.
It took me about it took me an hour so to figure out how it works.
It took you an hour to learn how to use pages.
Well yeah just maybe tomorrow I'll learn Microsoft Word maybe that was more the point.
What the spacing that doesn't make sense in Microsoft Word.
Was it like 55 minutes of just like why is this not ugly and then you did your report or like what.
Why do you not want to use the ribbon.
The ribbon is meant to make things easier to find and use and oh my gosh I want word
six so much when I try and use the ribbon.
But pages it's really good and it makes things look elegant.
This report that I put together it was beautiful and I had charts and graphs and they were
all lined up and you move it and like the text just gets out of the way and it was just
lovely.
I gotta say pages surprisingly good.
You should you should look into Mac OS I've heard it's it's pretty nice as well.
What's even more weird about this right it's because since this new job that I've referred to see earlier in the episode.
Yeah I've gone there a PC house of course they are I've just let I've just got my okay I'm working in a PC world I'm gonna lean right into PC world I'm using OneNote I'm using Microsoft task to do.
I'm just using all I'm sharing links out of Word documents.
Yeah you're a you're a PC guy and a PC world has been rifling through through my briefcase.
I'm window managing across multiple screens because I've got the double screen setup. I've just got a PC guy right.
PC guy. PC guy. We love you for it.
But when I think about pages I think that was lovely. I really enjoyed it and it was beautiful.
I have never I don't think I've ever created a word document is beautiful I've created plenty of word documents that are functionally sufficient.
You've just described office functionally sufficient.
Are we moving away from Andrew the business Canyon to Andrew I work Canyon is that what's happening today.
I think it's a canyon I think Andrew the business Canyon is reaching an intersection of the business and liberal arts.
(laughing)
Is it still called iWork?
- I have seen that name still float around,
but I don't think they actively promote it that way.
- 'Cause it's not really like a package anymore,
I feel like, right?
Like they're all a package in a sense
that they're like office thingies,
but I feel like there's no,
maybe somewhere in the app store it says
get the collection or whatever,
but I feel like I haven't seen just the term iWork
in a very long time.
- So I've just searched iWork
and there are current pages on Apple's website
that refer to it as those three apps.
But yeah, I don't think they sell it
or push it that way anymore.
- But it's not like iWork 23 or some crap anymore.
It's just whatever's the current one.
- Okay.
- But guys, at the same time as I successfully created
a really good pages document,
I've got another confession.
Yesterday-
- You use numbers rather than Excel.
- No, yesterday I built a spreadsheet.
- That might be a step too far.
- I built a spreadsheet yesterday.
- That's too pretty.
- It's been a little while
since I've built a spreadsheet from scratch, but I did it.
It wasn't overly complicated,
but then I added complication
'cause I wanted formulas to stay blank.
I wanted the cell to remain empty until it calculated.
So then, you know, so I over complicated it.
I used Excel.
I just defaulted to Excel.
- Of course you did.
It's what you know.
- I'm sorry. - It's who you are.
- And halfway through using Excel,
actually at the point where I was trying to get,
you know, do you know what I mean?
Like when you, so you want to pre-populate a cell
that does calculations, right?
And then later on, as you add data into other cells,
the result of the calculation pops up.
But in Excel, while the referencing cells are empty,
It'll give you like some result.
And that's ugly because it's incorrect.
So you want that result cell to remain empty until you enter data in.
Do you know how complicated that is to do in Excel?
You have to like nest your formula in another formula just to say, don't calculate this.
You can't just toggle something and say, you know, calculate when there's data.
I bet numbers just does that.
You actually have to formulate, build it.
Well, that's what I meant.
And that's the point I got to yesterday.
I was like, I wonder if numbers just does this.
I bet it just does it.
Cause it looks nice.
Yeah.
It would look really nice.
So maybe I have to re-engineer it in numbers.
But if people out there know, if people out there know, I would, I would love to,
uh, get your feedback on that.
No, please.
No, numbers do this.
So let me just bring up just while we're talking,
talk to yourselves.
Okay, I've got it here.
So my formula had to be equal.
- Wait till he finds out about Keynote.
Can you imagine when he learns that PowerPoint
is not as pretty as Keynote?
That's gonna blow his mind.
I'm just gonna throw that out there.
- I don't know, Calibri dresses up every single PowerPoint.
And now that they're moving to what is it?
Aptos, Aptos, what is it?
- Aptios. - Don't care.
- New default.
- Could not care at all.
It's gonna be given a run for its money. It was called Berenstain beers or something and they changed the name
Yes, dad or something. I think it was equal. Look at these studies equals if open bracket is blank open bracket
Yeah, open bracket dollar C 19 close bracket comma quote quote comma
F 19 divided by 2 close bracket show title if I've ever heard a show title like that's it
It's right there. That's if that's even allowed to be put into the text
I don't know it'll probably transcription software probably clear the whole database or something, but we'll try why should I have to do that just?
Just like it. I've got a better one, but you probably not interested, but basically I'm having to know
I'm having to do if statements
With is blank just to get a blank set up
Anyway numbers if you can do that if anybody knows numbers can do that to let me know right in
Can you do your job without using a spreadsheet?
Could you just eliminate the whole practice?
Well, that was a personal task.
That wasn't even work.
That was just me.
So you could just wipe it off the face of the earth.
You don't even have to touch a spreadsheet app.
In my current job, I encountered my first spreadsheet on Friday, but it was merely just entering some cells rather than actually.
Right.
And I met another person.
This is another exciting thing.
I met another person at work.
There's actually another person at your company.
Yes.
And they are an Excel person and like we bonded over like she had a formula and I was like, oh, that's an interesting way.
I was like, I would have used concatenate.
Wow.
But she was using another formula to merge cells.
I was like.
Excel just just bringing people together left and right building business relationships one Office 365 at a time.
That's amazing.
Reaching out across cell borders.
Across.
Literally across borders.
Yeah.
Don't format your cell borders in Excel, because then if you copy and paste them, it's mucks up your borders that the borders go with it.
I hate that.
It's all right.
They've only they've only been working on Excel for something like 380 years.
So eventually they'll figure out how to fix that.
Jason Beric looks so bored at the moment.
(laughing)
You did just literally read out a cell formula
on an audio format to, I don't even know how many people.
Imagine how-- - I'm pretty sure
about 15 listeners just had a car accident
trying to follow what you said.
- They got it open on their phone,
trying to figure out how do I even do Excel on my phone
while I'm driving, I don't know, but I need this,
don't worry, that formula will be the show title,
So it'll be right there. Copy and paste. You'll be ready to go.
Now, Andrew, I can say something in our topic pool that you probably want to mention.
Yeah. What's that?
Link to this topic. Are you going to refer to that?
Okay. Yeah. I didn't want to brag. Can you say it? Because I feel like I'm bragging on myself.
No.
No.
No.
You say it, Martin.
It's not my duty.
No. No, I can't.
I think they call that a humble brag.
Okay. So, okay. All right. Fine.
So the little mastodon toot, I tooted out about pages being good and making me money for consulting.
John Gruber favorited your post.
Hemispheric views on the map.
He also loves threads.
So take that for what you will.
I can talk threads if you want to.
I really don't, but please do.
I'm really dominating this episode.
Okay.
So, so I got the app.
I used it for like 10 minutes.
I didn't love it.
- It sounds like most of the users.
- My IPv6, IPv4 Eero router problem reared its head again.
And so I deleted the apps
'cause I needed IPv6 more than I needed threads.
- I love it.
I love that IPv6 has made a return.
- I don't get it.
If somebody can help me out with that,
Why is Eero, if I enable IPv6 on my Eero router,
all meta products stop working.
- Feature, not a bug.
- Well, that's what I figured.
So I deleted Instagram and I deleted threads
and I was like, ah, good.
Happy with that.
- Problem solved, yeah.
- Yeah, so I'm done with their apps.
- Anyway, just back to your humble brag.
I think that's great that he acknowledged you
for using pages.
And I want to echo John Gruber's acknowledgement
because I think Pages is a great app.
I used to use it at school, at uni.
I still use it for things like formatting,
transcripts that I do for my other research show stuff
that I've mentioned before.
The thing that I wanted to like kind of,
let's say phalange pick with you,
was that some time ago on this very podcast,
I was unfairly named Mr. Default.
Now it's true.
I do like default settings where possible
to avoid confusion or things breaking
and you can't find out where it is.
And look, pages, yeah, you could argue it was a default app,
but I also recall some time ago
when we were looking for some solution to the,
let's not say argument, but heated discussion
of where our topic pool would reside,
I threw pages out as a suggestion
due to its nice formatting and options
for various different things.
And someone by the name of Andrew Canyon
crapped all over that suggestion
and basically characterized pages as useless
in the face of something like Microsoft Office.
Discuss.
I think it was Jason that pushed against pages more than me.
Wow.
I don't know.
I think you both did, but I'm just trying to pin it on you because name is to pages.
And I think the problem with pages was that it was literally operated as pages.
You kept getting page breaks and things, and it was annoying.
I hated that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was actually more the, it was more the, the share, the collaboration
part was not working very well.
It's like you would make an update and then like it wouldn't show and then you'd reopen it and then everything was different.
It was very odd in terms of how it worked for three people trying to collaborate on the same document.
Yeah, but the thing that's so great about it is that and this is one of the beautiful things about Pages.
If Jason, for example, you and I had opened it in Pages and Andrew in some, you know, top class business environment had accidentally opened that document in Word.
and then inadvertently change something to do with the formatting, we would have had that wonderful moment of opening the app
to have that document open with a dialog box saying the fonts that you used were missing.
And that's something that I really enjoy coming from word to pages, knowing that
some version of Calibri or Franklin Gothic has not been translated well into Helvetica Noia.
So look, that's the fun that we're missing out on by not having this confusion.
We could move it again
If if we'd like we could go to bear on a bear doesn't do collaboration does it no no collaboration
Bears are bears heard solo creatures
Anyway, look I'm talking crap Andrew. I think it's fantastic that you got endorsed by mr.
Grover, and I'm happy that you're in the pages fold now, so good on you
Well, I just hope he starts listening to hemispheric views and throw some of that
You know fireball magic our way keep using and talking about pages and maybe it'll come true. You never know
Beep-bop-boop-beep-boop. I hope people listen to that with smart speed if people love this show
Unsubscribe wait, no
Sorry, what was the full question? That was it. Oh, that was the prompt that was like a like an AI prompt
Yes, should I put that into one of those thingies and see what it says? Yes if
If people like xhv...send.
Whoa, that's a lot of text.
This thing's really good at spitting out a lot of BS all at once, if it's not good for
anything else.
If people enjoy hemispheric views, it may be because the podcast offers diverse perspectives
and insights on various topics.
The hosts may present engaging discussions, provide thought-provoking analysis, or offer
unique viewpoints that resonate with listeners.
Ultimately, people's enjoyment of hemispheric views could stem from the quality of content
and the podcast's ability to captivate and inform its audience.
It knows we're a podcast.
It does.
It used to think far different things, so clearly it's learning.
I'm happy that it thinks that we're unique and informative and high quality, but do you
think we're diverse?
Oh, well, our perspectives are, surely.
Okay.
How much of this crap is just from some, like, thing that we wrote, like, three years ago
and it's in some like header of something.
By the way, I'm copying and pasting this to the website right now.
What you were meant to say, Jason, is if people like this show.
If people enjoy hemispheric views, it may be because the podcast offers...
Oh, you didn't want me to do it again.
No, stop, stop. Control C.
Control?
What?
It's a terminal. You got to control C it.
Would you like me to ask about
One prime plus comm would you like me to ask about that? Yes, I would
Okay
What is the benefit of?
One prime plus
Do I put the dot-com probably not I think that'll confuse it. I'm just gonna do one prime plus
Let's see what it says. Oh
Wow
OnePrime+ offers several benefits to its subscribers.
This is true.
Some of the key advantages include,
wow, it's still typing.
It's got a laundry list of things.
Oh my God, these are not real.
Okay.
Oh dear.
It's, hold on, it's a scroll.
There's, oh boy.
Okay, some of the advantages include
free and faster shipping.
Subscribers can enjoy free and expedited shipping
on eligible items,
allowing them to receive their purchases quickly
and without any additional cost.
That's helpful.
Oh, it's, oh, it thinks I'm talking about,
okay, nevermind, scratch that, delete that part.
(upbeat music)
- Friend of the show, Nick Tan,
introduced me and by extension all of us
to a YouTube channel that I think the majority
of the internet already knows about.
- Yes, I don't think this is a early show of a topic.
I think people probably know, but we didn't know.
- There's a new user born every day.
- That's true.
- Uncle Roger, Uncle Roger seems like his thing
is to just review online cooking videos
and give his opinion of them.
That's at least all I've seen so far.
I've enjoyed them, I've enjoyed them a lot.
My kids have also enjoyed them.
Everybody in our house is now running around saying, "Hi-ya!" A lot.
Is that a catchphrase from the-
Yes, it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When he says- Is that a celebratory thing?
It can be used in many ways, actually.
There is a video where he discusses how "Hi-ya" can be used in so many ways.
It's a very emotional kind of word.
So, yeah, it's really good.
I like it.
And I have learned so much about egg fried rice.
Good dish.
More than I ever thought I'd need to know in the last few days of watching Uncle
Roger. I encourage everybody to watch it if they haven't already.
I'm sure you have, because apparently everybody has except me.
Did you like and subscribe?
I did. I did both those things.
Oh, good. OK.
All right. Well, now I have to be a stickler in our show notes, which I wasn't
intending to be. But here I go.
Is this a media corner?
Yes, it would be.
I guess technically it is media that is within a corner.
So by definition, media corner.
- Media corner.
- Cool.
I just had to establish that.
- No, no, that means I can insert the theme when I edit.
(upbeat music)
(upbeat music)
Media Corner.
I have to ask you, Andrew,
how are you feeling when I'm editing,
which is not this time, so help me, help me,
help me, help me, help me.
How do you feel when I insert clips of you singing
into parts of the episode that you're not expecting.
- 45.
It makes me very happy.
- I'm pleased to hear that.
And did you detect at the end of last show's closing theme
before the surprise after show
that you were actually in the thing at the end of it?
- No.
Was I?
- You didn't hear it?
- I might have to go back.
I was probably listening at 1.3 speed.
I didn't know.
- I took an app corner fragment from your jingle
and put it on the last three kind of notes
at the end of the theme.
So you are actually part of last show's closing theme.
There are three rules of hemispheric views.
Always subscribe to one prime plus always listen to the very,
very end and always listen at one X.
Those that's it. It's that simple.
I'm going back. Yeah. I'm going to go listen at one X again. Okay.
Don't forget the subscription thing at the beginning that that was the first.
Before we likened you to Gandalf in the music there. Oh, right.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm going to listen again.
Okay.
Let me check it out.
I feel like I've, you went to a lot of effort with the edit and I haven't paid it due respect.
So I apologize.
Yeah, just this one time.
Yeah.
On the plus side though.
Thanks for juicing the download numbers.
So thank you.
You hear that Squarespace?
That's one more download.
Are we going to be a Squarespace company or a podcast, Squarespace podcast?
If we were going to get a sponsor in all seriousness, who would,
who would you like to have? If I know you don't like sponsors, Jason, I get that.
But let's say, let's say it was a, it was a deal we just couldn't refuse. Okay.
You get to choose who's going to.
The, the liquor, the licorice company.
Darryl Lee.
Daryl Lee, yeah, because then they would send me, they would send me like all kinds of free licorice and that would be great
What is with New Zealand and Australia and licorice? I feel like all the good licorice comes from
Either New Zealand or Australia. Why is that?
We take it seriously. We like it.
I like it's it's quite literally the only good ones that I've ever had in my entire life
And you just eating straight licorice or do you like it mixed with chocolate and other things or just all the things I like the
Fruit ones like the like the raspberries or the strawberries
I've seen that there's a watermelon one that I need to get my hands on apparently which that sounds life-changing but
Yeah, that's it's always the New Zealand or
Australian
Licorice that's the good one. And how do you feel about straight and a seed flavor? Is that your thing? Oh, no
No, okay, there's there's exactly 50% of our household that likes that and I am NOT in that 50%
She just made the black one like the normal black like genuine just like rich. Yeah, like licorice licorice flake. Yeah, that's the best
It's a whole point. No, it's
Like it's a it's a sweet or a candy that punishes you. It's like you thought it was gonna be nice
But yeah, it's like listening to a podcast at 1.5 X is really what it's like
I feel like someone who chewed tobacco a hundred years ago thought could we just have a dessert or sweet version of this and it's
Just like why do I want this black stuff all over my teeth? Yeah. Yeah, can we have dessert chewing tobacco? Let's have that
That sounds good
It's the best you guys are crazy. Do you spit your licorice into a spittoon?
Make some room smell nice
Oh, um, man, would you have a sponsor?
A sponsor?
Look, it's not someone that I'm dying to have on the show, but I feel like what would be most on brand, particularly
around May and June, would be Officeworks, just to really get that end of financial year thing happening.
I we've said this before, but if we could literally do a show recorded in an Officeworks, like at one of their little demo,
like desks with the chairs and stuff like that would be that would be so incredibly and like
have a live audience but like only two and a half people show up i think andrew would explode with
joy because the topic pool wouldn't be in craft it wouldn't be in apple notes or pages or bear
or evernote it would be on a flip chart oh flip chart yes and it would all there'd be so much
space you wouldn't have to have the page breaks would you? You wouldn't even have to flip
until you were doing like a members episode or you know refer back to another thing and you'd
have that whole awkward thing where like the permo has gone through to one but it's like oh where
was it and then suddenly there'd just be noise of paper flipping every it'd be really quite exciting.
He can have a tie on but it's like slightly loosened because he's like in the like sleeves
are half three quarter rolled up and he's just in there flipping pages.
Sweat marks on the light business shirt.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
Now that, that would be the show.
Can we have a parking lot for when topics like when we go off topic and we're like, let's just park that noted, but for later.
Always.
And you know what's happening?
I can already tell because Andrew's like lifting his arm constantly to park things in the parking lot.
And you know what happens when you lift your arm when you're in a business shirt, it untucks itself and you get that kind of bunchy thing above your pants.
Yeah, you get that.
And you're always trying to fix it and the only way you can fix it is if you go to the toilet and have to do
Extra business and do the whole removal and start again, but within two minutes you've lifted your arm and it's a ruin again
Yeah, we'll get you a laser a laser pointer so you can point at the screen
You can point at the the L the projector screen that you can't see because they're both light sources and they cancel each other out
So that'll be good
The parking lot thing at the end will get chucked directly in the trash
In typical business fashion because we know we're never coming back to any of that ever
But sounds like the perfect show you'll loop back around you want to loop back on that
Okay, we could think you know you do we can do a loop back. Yeah, maybe a next one looping
Let's just put the looping back into the parking lot. Okay guys. Yeah. Yeah next quarter. We'll get to that flowers now q3
That's a q3 thing like that one offline
q3 ok our objective
We just need to unpack this a little more if we could do that if there were a little more unpacking
I feel like we might be really getting to the to the meat of it. So moving forward. How do we feel about cascading? Oh
Yeah, well if you move forward enough that eventually cascades in on itself
Yeah back where you started so you've looped around
And then you're back in the parking lot. Don't forget
Critical path we got to make sure we're on the we got to get through that critical path
And there's the blockers on the critical path Jason. We got some hard deadlines. We need to meet okay with some unmovable
Yeah, just roadblocks, but
Unfortunately for this particular meeting I have a hard out so I'm gonna have to actually go, but if we could pick this back up in
Six weeks time that would be great
That'd be great and with those roadblocks make sure that you learn to love the problem don't need to solution mode too quick
Oh, no, no, no, we're in we're in we're
Squarely in problem space right now guys. We are ideation. This is ideation zone. No ideas about idea at this point
No idea, no, it's not brainstorming the way ideation ink have we turned that into a gen? Yeah, we right
Yeah, John's ideas are shit always
But everyone else's ideas are fine. So just know that
It's also good that if a woman speaks if you repeat the idea more loudly than she did it might be accepted
If you're in a business context for sure yeah in a business context that's right no matter how good her idea is
That's what the man does man spining man spining just man spining crucial that has been business
That was like not even that was like business cubicle. I wasn't even just like a corner
That was like a whole cube right there. That was that was business workshop
That was like Monday
Basically that that's a Monday for a lot of people right there. That was Monday
They feel like they just lived through Monday again. So apologies for that.
If someone listens to this on a Monday, they might actually like have a heart attack.
They're like, why is my work life in my podcast life?
Well, should have listened to 1.5X.
So that's the show guys. Type 45.
That's it. Type 45.
