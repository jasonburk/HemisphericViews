It's important.
It's important.
We got a new Apple podcast review
that I was hoping that I could share with everyone on the show.
Is that agreeable to everyone?
OK.
It's a badass I got for it. Okay, here we go. Apple podcast review quote
Updated review now five stars. I am so glad they finally decided to replace Andrew and Martin with Hannah and Natasha
They are two-thirds of the way to fixing everything that is wrong with this show
End quote and that is from hand Tasha
2786
Let me draw. I need one of those boards with the strings
I feel like it's pretty positive. It's a little bit of a criticism, but that's good. We accept
criticism just like anyone else. But yeah, I just wanted to share that. So I think we're
on the right track, it sounds like. That's what I'm taking from that. You're doing good.
Keep going.
So my question is, when is Valerie coming to fix this podcast?
We don't know. I think that seems to be the thing that they're trying to allude to. So
I guess we'll have to rectify that here at some point.
(upbeat music)
Moving on to the Patreon shout outs.
New shout out this week for David,
who supported us at the questionable
Southern Hemisphere level.
Not because it's that level,
but because the North is starting
to fall behind a little bit, but that's okay.
We appreciate it.
Thank you, David.
Cheers, and make sure you go
and get all your special goodies from the past
because I should know this,
but I believe as soon as you join,
you get anything that's happened in the past,
correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's the case.
So if that's not the case, I'm sorry,
and we'll figure out how to fix that.
- I've just got the vision of a 40 foot container
arriving at Dave's driveway
with a big Hemispheric View sticker on it
And just swag, just like falling out the back of it as he opens the doors.
That's my hope!
Or that's not the case, and I have no idea how Patreon works.
So we'll see.
50/50.
Well I have my suspicion that he only joined because of that improvement that you mentioned
from that podcast review.
I know, isn't that going to be awkward?
So hopefully we see you next month, David.
Sorry David.
Remember to include your shipping details so that we can get that container to you quickly.
and efficiently. Yeah, I mean the canal's open so it should be pretty quick now. I do have a fear that he's
in Western Australia though, and so I
Fremantle Port may still be a challenge. Oh shoot, okay. We do what we can.
Do you know as much about shipping as lean manufacturing, Andrew? It's funny you should mention that. I knew it. My first job out of
at a university was for the West Australian Department of Transport and
I spent significant you're a stevedore weren't you I?
Spent a lot of time around the ports
And then I went on to work at CVH group which owned and operated four ports of its own around Western Australia
But yeah, so yeah, I know a bit about shipping
What do you wanna know? Do you wanna know about freight on rail versus freight on trucks?
It's a big issue here in Western Australia. You have 15 seconds. You have the floor
Okay. Now the thing about Western Australia is it gets really efficient back all rights because and time right? Thank you for
Argument we'll take it under advisement and we will move on
I can see that there were two very special
Purchases recently we should get to the first one in the list Jason you bought an iMac. Are you sitting in front of it?
Yes, yes, I am you should know that Martin because look at sorry
I've cut you off already look at that image look at his look at like we can we have the privilege of looking at his
Head for the period of recording look how beautiful his head is it is beautiful. That's not an iMac camera
That's m1a I baby right there. Look at that. Look at that. He's got no wrinkles
He looks like he's just a permanent Instagram filter. It is take a gun
It actually is a little bit heavy on the whatever it's doing. I feel like
It's a little like I've turned on
Some kind of we chat filter. Yeah something. I don't know. I don't know. I'm only noticing it now
it seems like it looks better in FaceTime, but
Anyway, this iMac boy. I think everyone has heard about it by now has probably heard ample reviews
There's a lot of reviewers out there today that they just complain about dumb crap
Constantly and just can't appreciate anything
Apparently a lot of the folks that are doing them
They have a lot to say but I feel like they they're not coming from any place. That is a normal person
It's just a lot of really weird nitpicky stuff. It feels like they could all use a good couple of classes in
manufacturing in you know Andrew's area product design Jason's area and and just basic understanding of
how things are made not area because I
so much of
steel the reviews
aluminum aluminium
So many of these reviews just they don't take any of that into account and there's all these
Wacky things that they come up with so anyway that aside. We're done with that now. I'm done with the complaint corner this iMac is
really now what I feel the Mac was meant to be and
That sounds like a very bold statement
But I stand behind that because everything that I have done with this Mac in the last however long I've had it
I don't even know I feel like I've had it forever already which I think is a good thing. I'm very
Settled into it. It just feels correct. I said this online
somewhere else like Big Sur there's been a lot of
kerfuffle in the world of
Big Sur isn't great. It has all these issues. Whatever. I had a lot of issues with it, too
In terms of just why does this not work, right? What's going on here?
Brand new install on this m1 iMac. It's like night and day
It feels like this is what was being used by the people that made Big Sur and said,
"Here is Big Sur upon the world. Enjoy." Because it feels great. Everything feels super snappy.
Everything just works nicely. When you generally say like, "Oh, I always recommend Macs to people
because they're so nice to use." This is exactly what I'm talking about. This is what I want to
put in front of somebody and say,
here's what a computer is,
here's what a computer can be, enjoy.
It's just delightful.
I got the orange one because I love orange.
I still think the Tangerine iBook/iMac from the past
is like the best color ever
because it's just so blast you in the face.
But I very much appreciate these new
kind of subdued references to the past.
I think a giant, shiny, bright iMac is cool,
but probably doesn't really fit as many people's,
you know, aesthetic as these kind of subdued colors.
So color is amazing.
Apple Silicon stuff is just bonkers.
I did a whole DVD ripping thing recently,
and this thing was ripping 10 different videos
and encoding stuff, and it was just minimized in the dock,
and I was doing the rest of my normal stuff,
like nothing was going on.
Every CPU was just pegged to the max.
It just keeps going.
It just gives and gives.
Whatever this unified memory stuff is,
stop complaining.
It doesn't matter anymore.
None of these specs matter.
- I have two questions for you.
First of all, the screen.
So it's 24 inches, 4.5K, right?
Now, some people would say,
you know iMac was 27 inches at least at the
Maximum one who knows what they're gonna do with other models, whatever
How are you finding the space that you have on the screen and this somewhat strange resolution?
I came from a 38 inch ultra wide monitor
So kind of like worst case scenario
gigantic monitor
Super wide down to a normal aspect ratio
24 feels great for point. You don't feel cramped at all. No 4.5 K is
technically pixel wise
More pixels than even the 38 inch ultra wide because that was just a 4k
Basically, so it's 4k by
Whatever the hell it was wide
but this is actually more pixels than that and I was a little worried about that because I've
I've been known to say that I'll never go back
from an ultra wide monitor, but 24 has been great.
I'm sure if this were a 30, I'd say this is even better
maybe, but 24 is good.
21, no way.
That is way too small.
The old iMac, ridiculous.
No, absolutely not.
But this 24 feels great.
24 feels like kind of what the minimum monitor size
should be, totally okay with it.
And screen-wise, it is immaculate.
Whereas on the 38 ultra wide, you could still see pixels.
You know, if you're looking at it, it's kind of, it's okay.
It's not the best screen.
And most screens are kind of that plastic, you know,
instead of the nice glass.
If you're really into like matte screens,
then this is not gonna be for you.
- The 27 inch screen is beautiful.
And I don't know if I'd be able to go to something smaller.
That would really worry me.
- Yeah.
- I find when I get on my laptop, I'm like, oh, so tiny.
I never feel like even though the laptop I've got is an M1
I don't feel like I benefit from its speed because I don't fit enough on the screen
And I know that there's no correlation between those two things really it's a total just a brain
You just messing with your own brain, but that's how yeah, that's the experience I get that I'm more productive now my other question Jason
I know it's hard to quantify what you love about the iMac or pick certain things
it's the overall experience, but could you give us an impression of what you love about the iMac more specifically
that contradicts some of the silliness that you've seen in online reviews?
Yeah. Something that you would rebut. Yeah, I think this whole like "why does the iMac have a chin?" thing is
absolutely stupid. Could they have done it? There's no question.
There's absolutely no question that it could not be there. If you've seen what's in this that would be totally feasible and fine.
But again going back to
design and in how you interact and how you
feel about something you're looking at if I were looking at this thing and it were just a
Bezel a single white bezel. So if you took off the bottom part, that was the orange and it was just the white
It would lose
so much of what it is as a
show piece
They talk about how much Apple's is hyper focused on design to a fault in some points
They argue and then they say like why does that have a chin?
Why don't just make it like a monitor because if it was just a monitor it would be just a monitor and that is
Who you know, that's not
Important that's not the the design goal of the product if you if you got this one as the VESA mount version
Which doesn't have the foot and it were just a monitor it would have no personality at all
It wouldn't matter if it was a Mac at that point you get a Mac Mini
Cram it under a desk connected to you know Dell monitor. I
Frankly like it. I like that. It brings a little bit of the color up to the front the white bezel
Wonderful. I had no idea. I had no real feeling about it going into it every monitor
computer in history as a black bezel that seemed like that was correct. I
completely changed my tone on that. I think this is actually the correct
way to do it. I think black bezel is not good. I think this light gray is the way
to go. I find it much less distracting and it feels like even though it's 24
inches, whatever size the monitor is, it feels like the screen just kind of melts
away off into nothing rather than being this harsh box that I live in. Oh yeah, oh my gosh.
Also quiet, the quietness. My gosh. Just the fact that this thing could be running full
tilt and it's like doesn't even care. It just has more and more to give. Touch ID. Oh my
gosh. So good. I know that could probably be an issue if somebody's really into a different
Keyboard I was using the the magic keyboard anyway. Yep before so having the touch ID on there is
Is so cool. I turned off the watch unlock thing
I don't need it now and I found that that thing it would wake up the computer randomly if I just walked in the room
Sometimes but before I didn't have a choice
I was on a Mac mini so it was like this is what you get and did you get the compact or the extended?
Keyboard, I got the compact. I never
Kind of go back and forth on that a lot, but I like the idea of the big fat keyboard
But the thing I don't like is that then my mouse is way the heck off to the side and I prefer to have the mouse
and the keyboard
Closer together the touchpad. Oh, yeah. See he's got no and he's got a man's training. He's got to there
Okay, I feel like I'm watching Vogue Madonna's Vogue with keyboard
They are so the funny thing talking about design again
They always have this this way of every time they make a new thing
regardless of how
Basically the same product it is they somehow always at least in my mind find a way to make the previous one just look
Dated and old the second you see the new one, right? So like embarrassing. You're still using this old thing
Yeah, the old keyboard the old magic keyboard that you were just holding up magic keyboard - or whatever
Whatever was the one that was just previous to this, there's nothing old about it.
It looks like a...
Yeah, exactly the same one Martin has right there.
It looks still super futuristic and new until I put the new one on my desk and then the
other one was sitting to the side.
I was like, "Oh, what is that old looking thing?"
Just because I think just because the new border or the new corner radius on the new
keyboard is much more bubbly and fun I guess compared to the old one.
Solid kitcha.
So it's just funny how that always works.
You see it and you're like...
Smarton pulls out old iPods.
With the scroll wheel that works.
Yeah, so keyboard, fantastic.
So Hemispheric Views, we have available to us six thumbs.
Each of us with two thumbs times three of us.
How many Hemispheric View thumbs would you give these computer reviews?
I would give it six thumbs for sure.
Especially the thing that's really... being into computers and stuff for so long, nothing
like this in recent memory has happened in the sense that this is the crappiest one that
they're ever going to make.
And I can't believe what it can do.
Andrew, I understand that you also bought an iMac, but it's actually in the shape of
an iPad Pro. Disgust. Yeah, I got jealous of Jason's M1 and, you
know, I had my M1 in the MacBook Air, so I'm like, "Hey, I've got more money that's just
burning a hole in my pocket. Let's get myself another M1 in the form of a iPad." So I got
an iPad Pro 11-inch, so not the fancy big one with the super sexy screen, but one that
I could actually hold and use for sort of iPad-y things.
It arrived, I've had it for about a week now.
I got it basically on day of the release day.
I saw the reviews sort of coming out and mine was arriving and the shipping.
I was like, wow, that's pretty exciting.
I don't think I've really ever, not since maybe the very first iPad, like the original
OG iPad have I had one new one on release day.
So that was pretty exciting.
It's an interesting device and I say that coming from the iPad Pro 2017 that I had,
the curvy one, I've gone a few years without an upgrade in that world.
So I really went all out on this.
I got, I basically rebuilt my MacBook Air as an iPad.
So I got the iPad, I got the pencil and I got the super sexy magic keyboard.
I've got the full thing which weighs a freaking ton.
Now I've read all the reviews right and they say it's heavy and everything.
The iPad by itself is super light.
Like it's lighter than my old one which sort of surprised me because they always talk about
it being lighter but it looks heavier because of the chunkier sides whereas the old one
had the curved off back.
But the new one is light.
And then you put it in the keyboard and it's like, oh my God, it's heavy and awkward to
then open.
It's like the old iPad with its flippy keyboard, the keyboard cover, what did they call that
thing?
I'm no good in...
Smart keyboard.
What was that?
Smart keyboard.
That was good because I could just like flip that around.
It was like, I felt like I was doing origami with it.
Super fast.
one it's like... Sounds cool, a sound effects corner. That wasn't even added in post, that
was live folks. That's me. And then how do you just quickly flip it around if I was using
my keyboard but now I just want to hold it, you kind of have to jettison the whole keyboard.
It's like jettison situation in space where you just... I'm doing more foley, you know,
and like it just flies off and you're just left holding the iPad.
So I'm figuring all that out. It's all kind of new to me.
You are in an interesting position where you have an M1 MacBook Air
and an M1 iPad Pro.
Now we know basically what an iPad does that a Mac doesn't, right?
And I know that you do your podcast editing on ferrite like I do with the
iPad, but what did these device actually mean for you?
What is the appeal of the iPad or how are you using it in the way that you don't use the Mac?
Why both of these? Yeah, it's a good question
And and it was funny when I got it
My first initial reaction after using it for a short period of time was like I shouldn't have gotten the MacBook in hindsight
Probably a waste but you know
It kind of they come it comes in useful and it's still the old thing of like I still you still want a real computer
Sometimes when you're out to a real work, but what I love the iPad for
is
There's a there's an interesting review or sort of feedback you can send that to and you're real Andrew at hemispheric views calm I
Really love reading on the iPad. I hate reading on a laptop or desktop. I just can't do it
I just can never get the screen distance. I'm becoming old man. I got new glasses recently
They're bloody multi-focals for the first time in my life people always talk about the iPad being a horizontal device the landscape device
I use mine in portrait heaps and I think that's because I'm like I'm a reader rather than a gamer
I'll be reading constantly. I'll read news articles
RSS feeds
Basketball Twitter like everything I'm doing there is in portrait. It's just comfortable the other couple of things
I'll just say about the iPad and wrapping it to wrap it up. I'll say the face ID is super fast
So my only other face ID device is an iPhone XR that thing I thought was okay
But it's slow now you suddenly whoa this is and I think my iPhone
I think my phone's on to me because the 10r has been
Like really janky over the last week or so like sweeping in and out of the camera app. It's just like
Chugging I think it's give me the side
I it knows it knows it's not the best camera in the house now because I think I've become one of those iPad camera guys
Where the iPad is actually the best camera I own you're gonna take it to a matinee show and put it above the crowd
Hold it up. Yeah, I think I might at least with this keyboard. It's not gonna flap around underneath it now
I did the thing if I just transferred like give me my old iPad on my new iPad and that setup is amazing
Anybody who's like tried that recently? It's incredible
And when you think about how hard it used to be transitioning from one machine to another Wow, that's flawless
But yeah, it's like there's gotta be and I look at the like battery usage what's draining and there's kind of like nothing
But it just seems like it dips away
So I've started getting rid of some apps that I think might be a bit dodgier like Jason
You'll be happy to hear this Devon think to go
gone
- - gone
Devin think Devin think - gone guy. It just spent half its life sinking. I think that a shape
Yeah, we're creating new shapes now. It's a six-dimensional shape. It's a dimension where you spend half your life syncing your databases
Only to never actually use any of the material in those databases. Oh, I'm doing this
That's what I said when I tried to use it. Maybe it's games. I don't know. I'm not using that me again the games
I use right? Okay, so maybe it's chess from chess.com
Or it could be New York Times crossword
And you're using you're really making use of that m1 the m1 chip is working hard. Yeah, I haven't felt it yet
So tell me what it is somebody help me out why what is it training my battery?
How can I diagnose it beyond just looking at that little battery chart that says no
She did good no significant usage. Can I help you out with that real quick, please?
There's actually nothing wrong at all and it's all in your head or its maximum brightness on Excel
It's those white backgrounds you got to switch to numbers so you can do the black background ones one drive
It could be it actually I
Don't have an m1 iPad and I think I but I'm I'm very
excited that I think I
I really truly believe there's a higher reasoning for why everything's going to be the exact
same guts.
To go from an Apple Watch, you know, size thing all the way up to a 30-inch, you know,
super crazy Mac Pro whatever it's gonna be, and they're all exactly the same architecture
through and through.
Not just, "Oh, well, they're all ARM."
Like, no, they're the same thing.
It's just that the watch one has two cores and the Mac Pro has 20,000 cores.
Having everything be the same is going to be a very good long-term strategy for what
it means to compute in the next 10 years.
So to wrap that up, Andrew, what's the score for the iPad?
I'm going to give it four thumbs up and one thumb sideways.
Oh, okay.
4.5 thumbs. Yeah, if iPadOS comes out and makes it a lot better, it'll get another thumb,
it'll get like 5.5 thumbs. I would like to say that in the 21st century, I'm very grateful
that we have something that has long been regarded as a hobby product, but I feel has
grown into an enjoyable product with a range of apps and a lovely experience that is not
really available from any other company. Yes there are game consoles that are
arguably more powerful for things like games, yes there are interfaces and other
recording or set-top boxes that maybe you prefer, but no one really offers a
computer for your television like Apple does. And even though people might have
not liked the last remote I can understand why because you picked it up
the wrong way or the symmetry was weird or it was covered in glass or not terribly ergonomic.
I like to think that in terms of scrubbing and navigation, it brought the trackpad that
we like from the Mac to the remote and just about killed every other sort of button. I
think that kind of gets lost when we talk about navigation on that remote. Now, whether
or not you like the newer one, yes, I bought the newer Apple TV 4K with this wonderful
new remote that most people seem to like. I'm personally very glad that they have brought
back the D-pad style thing but integrated it with the trackpad because it's wonderful
to have that option of navigating differently depending on the app or whether you want to
flick quickly from one side to the other or just, you know, shift around a little bit.
And personally I like the heft of it. I like the way it feels in your hand, that it's a
bit larger, and the fact that it's aluminium/aluminium for the Northern Hemisphere just feels a bit
less fragile. So I know that there are some, and one of them might speak in a
moment, would like things to be a bit different. Personally I'm very grateful
that this thing exists and it seems to be fairly focused and doesn't try to be
other things. You can play games on it if you want, you don't have to, the apps are
there, whatever. That says it all.
[Music]
June Arcadia! Don't forget, June Arcadia. Yep. My brain is just
woken up I think I just figured out that I'm awake and alive Arcadia June get
your scores in we've already got a lot of scores in there because we've kind of
cheated and started early but there will be prizes galore at the end of June
Arcadia we had the lovely creator of Arcadia join our discord and chat a
little bit in there that was pretty cool and yeah so get Arcadia play the games
get the scores in and buy all these new products not to mention while you're
playing Arcadia in June, if you're looking for a cool soundtrack, why not
check out the Hemispheric Tunes playlist? Good idea. Yeah. Good idea. How cool is
that? And you would do that. You would sit in your darkened library lounge
room, listening to your HomePod play the Hemispheric Views while wearing a
Hemispheric Views shirt that you purchased. If you're Martin, you'll sit in
lounge room listening to it on an iPod Hi-Fi via a click wheel iPod of which
he's meticulously downloaded all of the tunes from the playlist somehow
transferred them over via iTunes 6 and he's off and running just don't update
the playlist you could put you get a sticker you could get a hemisphere if
you sticker slap it on the side of your iPod Hi-Fi yep that'd be pretty cool
Talking about stickers, we actually need to make one that's short enough in height that
can cover up the Samsung logo on my monitor, because then I'd be perfectly happy with it.
Oh, good point.
That is, we'll get on that immediately.
If we can get some folks to join the Patreon to support this lovely endeavor, that would
be great.
That would go a long way in helping more stickers be created, I think.
I love the URL for this.
One prime plus dot com.
Isn't that great?
Easy.
It's brilliant.
How do I get there?
One prime plus dot com.
Done you're there brilliant
Okay shoes, can we get to the shoes now, okay
Why was this on the list?
Angry far out. Oh, he's like just sound like he wanted it all to be over. I'm just fired up now
I just woke up now that Jason's all fired up. This is something that I think about fairly often because I
I live in my own home and I visit other people's homes and everyone in their own home seems to have their own approach
to the shoes situation
It can be quite controversial. I'm gonna be up front
I'm a shoes off in the house guy, right? As far as I'm concerned
When one enters one's home, it is a sanctuary. It is meant to be kept clean
There may be carpet. There may be floorboards, tiles, laminate, whatever
You sometimes may walk across it with bare feet or socks that you have just washed
Dried and pulled out of your wardrobe
It is a place of comfort because if one walks with shoes and leaves detritus on the floor
Then one walks through with socks and then puts said detritus on the lounge or sofa. This is my policy
There are exceptions if there is an emergency or you have to rush back in to pick something up that you forgot
Shoes inside are okay. Just be very careful on carpet. This is only if you are in an absolute rush
Okay, when visiting other people's homes offer to take one's shoes off
don't be presumptuous, but and this is where you have to look after your own socks, particularly if they're white or
Colored or special or a novelty in some way particularly if you're going to a house that involves outdoor dining or entertainment
There may be cross contamination between the deck area where a barbecue is
the inside so you can't really be taking shoes on and off all the time so you
have to rely on the host and what they want to do as to whether you leave the
shoes on generally it's a shoes on situation so I suppose what I'm getting
at here that this is something that I think about maybe too much what do you
think both of you about what I just said and do you have your own thoughts on the
shoe policy go ahead Andrew I like what you say in theory and I wish I could be
like you. I really do. But I don't. I don't. My shoe policy is kind of like wipe them off
when you get to the front door and then just have at it. Like come in, I don't care, leave
your shoes on. Take them off when you're ready to get comfortable but you can leave them
on, it's fine, I don't mind. Just don't like put them on couches, like they stay on the
ground but you can walk around there. And you can't be taking your shoes on and off
all the time. I'm like laces. Takes too long. Especially if you've double knotted.
Don't you have thongs? Yeah but and then you go this is the other thing my
house has like five doors. I'll walk out and I take the shoe off and I go to
another door and I'm like where are my shoes? I've lost. They're back at the other
door. I'm buggered now right? So I either walk outside with no shoes or it's just
always wrong right? The shoe is always not where you need it to be. So otherwise
I have like little caches of shoes at each door
hmm, but inevitably there's gonna be a pattern emerge and you're gonna end up with a
Mother load of shoes at one location and you have to reestablish it
We have a shoe box like near our back door mainly for the kids. It doesn't really work
We've had tradies come in recently and say that I'll jump in to take my shoes off. I'm like
Life's too short man. Just come on in. Yeah, but that's fine. See people come into my home. They might be relatives
There could be tradies or something shoes in the house. Okay. I don't want to make people uncomfortable
Maybe they have a foot odor problem. Maybe they can't get it back on. I just want to be asked
Okay
But sometimes as well don't you find that I find walking and shoes more comfortable than walking bare feet or in socks like so
No, not in home. No, you don't want that extra sort of suspension. No, I want to be able to breathe
I want air around my feet Jason. What do you can you help us out? So I
I am in full agreement with Martin on this.
No shoes in the house, with an exception.
Okay, so here we go.
You come in the house, you take your shoes off.
Simple, just take 'em off.
You know, you're walking around outside, that's gross.
I don't want that on my floor, touching my feet.
I don't like dirty feet, I just don't like it.
So, if you leave the house again, put your shoes back on.
I have a pair of sandals at the ready,
generally by the back, going out to the deck outside,
because you go outside, put your sandals on,
come back in, take 'em off.
Easy, no tying, no nothing, no pulling on shoes,
you're just quick in and out.
I gotta go throw something in the bin outside,
boom, sandals on, sandals off, easy.
- Nice use of the word bin.
- The only amendment that I will add,
So, okay, when a person comes into the house,
if they are a tradie, I generally,
depending on where they're going to go,
if they're gonna come in and go upstairs
where it's just complete carpet situation,
nope, take 'em off, get 'em off, stop it.
If they're coming through the garage
and going down into the basement to do some kind of work,
I kinda gauge each person as they come in
And I can kind of tell like this guy is going to be dramatic about it and is going to be
a whole thing with him and he's going to think he's going to like now do a worse job because
I made him take his shoes off.
You know you can kind of tell if that's if that's going to be the situation.
So in that case I'm like you're going to be a pain in the ass down the line.
So I'm going to go and let you have you know shoe availability throughout your stay here.
If I know them, or they're just kind of a normal person
coming in, not doing any kind of thing
that's gonna affect my home, off.
Absolutely off.
And most people can tell,
because we'll have shoes by the door
that are a very clear indication
that I'm not wearing shoes right now,
and I am within inside these four walls.
There are a pile of shoes there.
Put two and two together, probably take 'em off.
Thank you.
- I do the same thing.
The other thing I will add is that you mentioned
comfort of shoes inside the home.
I have a pair of shoes that are specific inside only shoes
for which you wear only within the home
and they have free reign.
They can go on carpet, they can go on hardwood,
they can go on tile, they can go everywhere.
They're allowed full coverage of the house
because they are inside shoes.
Should you take those shoes outdoors ever they now are compromised shoes, and they are only allowed
To be outside shoes from then on out they can no longer be inside shoes you have to get new inside shoes if they get compromised
So just to be clear you're talking about actual shoes not slippers. They're kind of a hybrid II slippery shoe thing
They'll be in the show notes. They're very comfortable. I call them my my house shoes
so
That would be the amendment that I would add to the doctrine that was put forth earlier
If you're getting dressed I keep my shoes my going-out shoes in the wardrobe with the lion and the witch
In a bag. No, they got like we've we got our wardrobe pre-built recently. It's got kind of like little shelves
I love a good shoe shelf. Yeah. Yeah, and you so you select your shoes
Then I sit on the bed or something and put them on now. Where's that sit in your situation?
Do I have to should I be taking them and then carrying them to right outside the door and then putting them on at that?
Point I mean they really shouldn't be up there to begin with yeah
I'm worried about dirt collecting in your shelf or if it's one of those metal grates every time you put it on it's actually
Scraping dog shit onto your clothes underneath. That's what I'm worried about and I'm also wondering
I mean aren't you already aware of your wardrobe like you're mentally thinking okay? I'm putting on this suit it matches those shoes
I'm just gonna go and put them on later or do you have like a mental disconnect of what actually matches your nice suit reference
By the way there. I like that that you went for the suit and shoes route. That's a good one
He's wearing a tie. He's got one of those little little machines that has all the ties on it
They're like you push the button and it rotates around the tire kind of not far from the truth on that
I do have like a little thing. It's not motorized. But yeah, I have a thing Tyrek
Is it like the old wind-up windows you actually have this little thing with you?
Spin around manuals like rotating a rotisserie
I
Don't know how that's the question. I just I select my outfit
I put my clothes on and I finished off with a pair of shoes and then I like
Then I might be called to go make a sandwich or something for a kid
Wearing those shoes before I leave the house. It's like well, that's good fine
I have a question for you about when people enter the house
Right. Obviously Jason is more bothered by shoes in the house as I am Andrew your last day fair
But just to even the playing field just even the playing field their dirty shoes. There's visible muck
Okay, not muddy, but you go there's dirt on that
They don't offer to take the shoes off upon entering your home. I have no poker face
It's written all over my face. Do both of you show your frustration or say something?
I would say do you mind wiping your feet on the mat?
That would be as far as I'd go as long as some actions being taken now to be fair
I'm not an animal right if I've been out and it's like my feet if I've been mowing the lawn or I don't know this
Dirt grass and it's stuck to my shoe. I'll take my shoes off and leave them outside, right?
I'm not an animal or I will give them the the bang bang bang
Treatment and then take them off and take you know how to take them into the laundry and maybe rinse them off or something like that
I'm not a total animal. I didn't say that but for just like I've gone to the office
Commuted home, and I'm walking in the front door like
Let me get in the house. I'm not taking my shoes off before I walk it
It's it's my house, but don't you want to throw them off be liberated from the work
I want to sit on my bed and take them off
Take them before you enter your bedroom takes a balance. Do you have how do you take your shoes off?
We standing up easily the I lean against a wall or just stand on one leg
Yeah, I think I'm becoming an old man. I think I have those skills anymore. So you need to check your equilibrium Andrew
I've got a I got a bad head a quarter zone injection in my hip a couple of days ago
Things are getting bad around these parts
You're falling apart. I'm lucky to touch my toes
Maybe maybe you're at that point in your life where you just need to switch to the slip-ons, you know
Maybe that's kind of where we're at now. You got the Birkenstocks. That's the other problem giant feet
There's nothing more offensive that like you go to a hotel room and they always have those little like like if you go to a half
decent hotel and they give you the little complimentary slippers and
The maybe the coat not nothing ever fits me like the slippers. I can't even get over my feet at all
I'm like a size 14
You brought up hotel. I hate touching a hotel floor with my feet
Yeah, don't think but just don't think about it. It's building up your immunity. Okay, it's just strengthening the immune system
So Jason you enter a hotel room
Everything looks clean. Everything's beautifully prepared
No concerns
You went to the bathroom and you noticed that the toilet paper has been folded into the nifty trying very handy
But it's evidently not a new role. Don't like that. How do you feel?
It's it's funny because I you know, I
previously work wise lots of travel traveling all the time just in traveling
equals the dirtiest most filth infested places you go walking into his hotel
room with a black light you start you start travel by getting into a car
that's not yours so they can take you to the airport you then get to the airport
which is the filthiest place on the planet to then get on a plane which is
is the grossest mode of travel there could possibly be to then land in yet
another airport that's probably even grosser than the one that you left
originally to then get in another car that is also not yours to be taken to a
filth house of which who knows how many people have previously done their living
in prior to you has been marginally clean / setup regardless of how nice of
hotel it is. It's just gross and I think I've built up tolerance over the years
to just accept the fact that it's gross but I never can just walk into a hotel
room and think yeah this is really nice this is gonna be great this is gonna be
very nice and refreshing. Do you touch the TV or my oh god no. Do you pack
- I like my gloves, plastic gloves.
- I'm not that, you know, obsessive about it,
but boy do I think about every single thing
that happens in that hotel room
and what things I have to touch/manipulate
that have been manipulated in the past.
I don't like it, I'm not a fan.
I like a good sandal in a hotel room,
I think that's great, I love a good sandal,
'cause that floor, ugh, the carpet's the worst.
Like tile, you could bleach the hell out of that tile.
That's probably okay.
But that carpet, that vacuum from 1978
that has the same bag in it since probably that same year,
marginal suction, that's not a Dyson vacuum they're using.
That's not picking stuff up.
That's just pushing stuff around.
It's probably blowing more stuff out
than picking stuff up, let's be honest.
- The only thing in a hotel room that grosses me out
The extra pillows the she's you know, they never did inevitably go on the floor
Yeah, they go on the floor and they never change like at least the other pillows get a new fresh pillowcase on it
Yeah, you have like a little bit of a barrier there. But yeah, the decorative extra ones. Those are floor pillows
Yep, those are chucked in every gross possible corner
Used for who knows what don't send your mind down that pathway Jason don't here
We are getting back everybody's ready to go traveling again, and I'm just like maybe I just will never travel again
As long as tech a pair of sandals, so I think that's I think that shoes. That's how shoes work
I'm very glad with that win. Thank you both. I'm obviously the disgusting one of the three

Wow and a huge thank you to our newest Patreon supporter, none other than my mum.
Jennifer, thank you for your support of our podcast. It's pretty nice to have
your mum supporting the work you do and I can't believe that my mother is still
geeky enough to listen to us three geeks yammer on about technology and stuff
like that. It's pretty awesome. She's a good mum.
