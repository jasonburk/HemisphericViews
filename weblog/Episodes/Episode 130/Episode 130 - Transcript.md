Oh, Jason's got the red wine.

I'm in the podcast zone.

Isn't that how you do it?

Lounge chair.

Sounds good.

Do you know what it reminds me of?

Hmm.

Um, UB40.

Oh.

Red, red wine goes to my head.

Should we just listen to that for the next 43 minutes?

Every time I've heard that song, I feel like the title of the song needs to be changed

to include an H in the wine.

I've always felt that.

A bit too.

Yeah.

Yeah.

A bit whiny.

I mean, I don't hate it, but it is a bit red, red, whiny more than red, red wine.

It's fair.

Yeah.

Look, it's not one of the greatest pieces.

I don't know why it had such commercial success, really.

And I always think of WD-40 when I hear that name.

So, it's like a trip to Bunnings to get some industrial solution when someone's whinging.

I don't know.

It's a bit strange.

He's whining because the screws won't come out and he needs the WD-40.

It's just.

Well, it's whining because it's rusty or something.

It's actually.

Yeah.

That's true.

Like when the door gets that, you start to get that squeak in the door.

And then you got to get out the WD-40, do the thing.

And then all the gross stuff falls on the floor and it's a whole.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Except our, our doors open clockwise.

Your doors open counterclockwise.

But otherwise.

It's the Coriolis effect.

It's the same.

Really.

When you flush them.

Yep.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That makes sense.

Okay.

Now, look, I have to cut to the chase here because I've been very curious about what's

in the notes.

There's a robot, which means Jason put it there.

And then it says Martin uses.

And then there's an ellipsis.

Those three dots within like nested within double inverted commas.

Are you saying?

Yeah.

I like to use ellipsis or it's a mysterious item that isn't filled in because I actually do quite

like ellipsis. I'm very aware of that. Yeah. It's the first one. Um, it's the, the fact that you

use them, uh, a lot. Are you being serious? This is actually what it's about. Yes. Yeah, it is.

Yeah. Oh. Um, because generally when I, when I think about people, so let's take text messages,

uh, I messages, if you will. That's what we're talking. Messages. Makes sense. Yeah. That's

what we're chatting. Um, did you say text messages like text, text, text and messages?

Text messages. Yeah. Yeah. When we're at a text mix restaurant, uh, Martin will often use an

ellipse. Okay. Several times. Text mix is like an abbreviation for text message. I'll send you

a text mix. Yeah. He would say text mix dot, dot, dot is what he would say. Um, I just, I,

when I see them in text conversations, there's a definite feeling of passive,

aggressiveness. I think when you see somebody using dots a lot and a lot of the time people

of a certain age, I think maybe don't realize that that's what they're doing, but they kind

of mean to do it. And I've been noticing lately that Martin uses them quite a lot in our three

way texts, uh, exchanges. Just thought I'd bring it up and see, uh, if anybody else noticed that.

Anybody else say me and Andrew? I hadn't, I hadn't. But, um, now as I scroll back through,

yeah, there's one, there's one, I see one. There's another one. There's another one.

Oh my goodness. You're right. It's just, it's an epidemic.

Martin. Epidemic. Yeah. That's a good, it's a good way to put it.

Why do you do, Martin? Why do you do this? Is it, is it, is it just, I feel like it's representing

an unfinished thought.

Yeah.

Like he's kind of thinking, but he's, he's being a little relaxed, but we know Martin

can't be too relaxed. You know, it has to be.

What do you mean?

Dot, dot, dot.

So I like to think it's him, his way of just, just having an open conversation. It's like

pause for thought. Here's my next little bit of thinking. Right, right, right. Dot, dot,

dot. And another little piece. I'm going to take it graciously rather than him being,

being footish.

So to you, he's leaving the door open for you to, to enter into the conversations.

Yeah. I think it's a generous form of conversation.

Oh, okay.

It's like here, I'm leaving a trail. It's like a little, it's like, like honestly, like

little, um, you know, cookies or crumbs.

Breadcrumbs.

Breadcrumbs. That's the one I was trying to think of.

But really I'm a witch, like luring you into an oven or something.

Yeah. He's going to shove you in, look inside my beautiful oven and then shove you in there

with this giant,

Magnet foot.

And then apply a force field.

Exactly.

Um, so do you actually want a response or?

I would, I would, I'm here for it. Yeah. I wish I had a thing of popcorn, but go ahead.

Yeah. Oh, look, I'm glad you bring this up because I like ellipsis. I like to use those

dots. I hadn't actually realized that I was using it that much. I knew I used it quite a bit, but

you know, not to that extent. So I'm more than happy to rein it in if it causes distress or

confusion or,

I don't know, a feeling that there's some passive aggression in our group chats. Thank you. Um, no,

not at all. Uh, no, actually it's just, so I do tend to maybe overthink my use of punctuation. I

am a fan of the M dash as attaching a kind of clause or an idea, but the M dash has its own

kind of, I don't know, some people like spaces around them. Some people don't. So I don't want

to overuse that. And then you've got the semicolon. I'd say the semicolon is the most underappreciated

of all punctuation.

Marks. But the problem is that I think people are quite uncomfortable about how they should use them.

I feel like you either use too many or too few. Yeah. You think like, oh, I'm going to use a

semicolon. They're like, wait, maybe I need another one. Oh wait, maybe another one here.

Maybe another. And then you've got like seven around like six words somehow. And yeah,

you've lost the point.

Exactly. And then commas are very useful, obviously for pause and listing. But if you have too many

commas, then you have gigantic, super long sentences that people start to lose track of

what you're saying.

Question marks obviously have their function. You're only using them for questions. If I start

giving statements and there's a question mark, you might think, is Martin in doubt? Is he in

constant self-doubt? Is he all right?

Sometimes.

And then exclamation marks are friendly, but you put too many and then you're shouty. And then

that brings me to the most common sentence finisher, the full stop. Now, to me, the full

stop is the most aggressive potentially, or the coldest punctuation mark to end a sentence with.

If you're going backwards and forwards in text, you could sound very friendly, but suddenly

you have put a full stop.

Full stop or period at the end there. And that's it. So I always kind of intended the ellipsis to be

this, not necessarily friendly, but as Andrew was hinting, it's open or what do you reckon,

or just kind of drifting out, not so much for mystery or dramatic pause, but yeah, we'll see.

But now that I see that it's caused some anxiety or doubt among my co-hosts here,

I'm willing to rein that in. So I'm going to put out a poll right now to the two of you,

which sentence finishing

punctuation mark would you prefer to see in messages from me?

No punctuation.

Well, that's not an option. That was not.

I just figured it wouldn't be.

I want to see a full stop. That's the appropriate way to end a sentence. A full stop is-

How about this for a compliment?

It's a signed purpose.

I will add more full stops for the mix into the mix with appropriate emoji to show happiness,

contentment, or approval in the group so that people are not feeling,

anxious about the potentially cold full stop.

Does it drive you nuts when I do two periods?

I don't notice it too much, but yeah, now that you bring it up, it's not ideal.

I wouldn't lie.

Because that's in between. Is that?

Well, you know what else annoys me? For some reason, I don't know if he's to blame,

but you watch any of the Star Wars films and George Lucas thinks that an ellipsis

has four full stops in it.

That's true. I won't do four. That's just madness.

And it's not even, I don't even necessarily think that it

leads to the full justification of that scrolling text.

I don't think so.

It just kind of, so what's the point? You've added one there.

Is it three or is it, what are you doing? So anyway. All right. Well, thank you for highlighting

this. I'm sure the listeners probably think that I'm even more insane than they already

thought that I was.

Probably.

Happy to be outed in that sense.

Job done. Wow.

Beautiful.

There you go.

Oh, is it me again?

This is where you promote yourself, I think.

Yeah. I'm going to do some self-promotion because that's what this is all about.

Like and subscribe.

Yep.

Uh, building a brand iPods I've been talking about and I was going to buy an iPod, a big,

we talked, that was the title of the show. It was like iPod, hot rod, something, hi-fi,

whatever it was. And I was going to get a hot rod iPod. And then I started looking up videos

of like how you can do it yourself. I was like, okay, that seems pretty cool. And I started

watching videos and was like, nah, that seems that's a step too far trying to do that.

Um, and then about eight minutes later, I was halfway into an iPod, opening it up to do it myself.

And so I ordered a bunch of parts to, uh, hot rod my own iPod. And I figured why not do a live

stream and hang out with people and have them watch me hopefully complete this iPod project,

or maybe, um, end up with a complete disaster and I'll have to buy the other iPod anyway.

Either way, it'll be fun. So I'm calling.

It, uh, iPod mod and chill is the title of this, uh, this little, uh, swanky live stream that we're

going to be doing. So it will be a week. When is it going to be February? I don't know. It'll

be in the show notes. You'll see, but it should be fun. I think maybe even interesting.

Do you remember when I was the iPod guy? I think you have lent into this big time,

Jason, you are the iPod guy now. I'm big iPod guy, big iPod energy over here. Um,

I think also fun, fun little teaser that I don't think even Andrew knows

this iPod will look very familiar to him on this live stream. I won't say more than that.

Is it a, I mean, I guess it's the HP one because he was like a PC guy.

Oh God, the HP iPod. I don't know what's worse. That'd be the U2 iPod. Oh wait,

no. I, yeah, the U2 one is worse. Sorry. I don't know why I would even think the HP one

ranks above the U2 iPod. I hope it was for sure. My, I think, do you know,

I didn't have that many iPods actually. I was late to the game. My first one I ever bought,

which is still the greatest one I've ever owned. And I hope this is why you say it

was the iPod with video. That was, I love that thing. And I hope that's the model you've got.

Are you part of that, uh, community of people who are trying to keep the games alive?

I think what Jason has just flashed in front of the camera, maybe confirms that.

Does look familiar. Teaser. Good teaser. Wow. That is, it's, I still miss,

I still miss the iPod. Next topic.

This is strange. This is weird because there's a, usually we have our emojis in place. Whereas

Jason is the robot. I'm the basketball and Martin is the foot. Yes. It's been that way forever.

Yeah. Well, not forever. So I'm looking at our little run sheet and we've got a magnet.

Hmm. Now what's going on? Do we have a guest today? No, I just wanted to see

if it would piss you off. I replaced the foot, which technically I never chose with something

that creates its own force felt. I like it. It makes sense. It makes sense. Look, it doesn't

have to be that way. It might be feet. Sometimes it might be feet around a magnet, but I thought

I'm going to chop and change and just keep it a bit unpredictable because I know that sometimes

people on this show don't put emoji there at all. It's true. Yeah. Every once in a while that does

happen. Sometimes people put topics and they don't remember what they were talking about.

So I'm going to try and get rid of that. I'm going to try and get rid of that. I'm going to try and get rid of that.

I'm going to try and get rid of that. I'm going to try and get rid of that. I'm going to try and get rid of that.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

I'm doing it too.

yes still waiting andrew's watch this can you hear us andrew andrew are you there are you frozen

is he actually frozen he looks like he's pretending to be frozen he looks like he's

pretending to be frozen so dumb it's a slight like you know you just can't not move as a human being

it was the tiny bit it was the ever so slight just twitch look i've got it i've got to admit

i've been watching i've been watching police squad recently and i don't know if either of

you have ever seen that the old lizley nielsen tv show there was only six episodes i think yeah

before naked yeah yeah and one of the gags in that is that they run the ending credits

and all the actors like in the 80s tv shows you know they'd always finish on like a like like a

tableau dukes of hazard or something would happen and they'd be like yeah and then they'd freeze

frame it and run the credits that was kind of the way tv wasn't that era well of course they take

and all the actors just freeze in whatever thing they're doing you know they might they've got they

might have arrested a guy and then the arrested guy realizes that they're frozen and so he just

kind of like walks out of the prison leaves i don't think i've ever seen that from the series

that's great it is well it was convincing for a bit but then i i was also wondering if i needed

to call like triple zero on the podcast 9-1-1 for americans to get like an ambulance is he having a

stroke or something i didn't know it was it was either frozen faking or something like that i

was either frozen faking or stroke those were my three options and this is very much to warn me that

i was having a stroke so how would we know you were dead we wouldn't know good point though because

that's the thing in my mind it's like that's it's it's like this positive storytelling about how

apple watch saves your life but also this to use the word passive aggressive or anxiety inducing

if you stop wearing this product you may die it's possible yeah yeah so um anyway well onto another

watch another watch issue

we could trans transition smoothly from watch to watch jason you have something about a um a stone

yeah i've been uh collecting rocks recently for uh doing rock tumbling are you guys familiar with

you've been watching shrinking yep we have actually like cornhole yeah we started that

pretty recently no the pebble watch is coming back apparently did either of you have a pebble

watch i'm familiar with it i remember it but i did they come to australia i can't remember they

probably did that's what i was curious about i don't know if they ever made it and why were they

so cool were they the ink ones or something yeah they were like the e-paper watch face so they

lasted like i think a long time they had like a lot of cool like bands and colors and and stuff

like that and i don't remember when the first one came out it must have been very close to the apple

watch because if it wasn't there's no way i would not have had one if it weren't for the fact that i

already had it was i think at least a couple of years beforehand oh interesting i don't know why i

never had one then it's very unlike you because do you remember there was this whole what's apple

gonna do there's already watch stuff out there yeah tim cook or a failure all that kind of stuff

yeah i don't i don't know why i never had one i'm not sure what i guess i just missed the boat there

but apparently they're gonna come back which is weird because they sold to go to google i believe

or they sold to somebody and then to go whatever as with all things it ends up it went through

fitbit and then into google oh okay and then fitbit went to google i think as with all things

they get absorbed and ruined um so i guess they open sourced the pebble os or whatever the hell

it's called so that means that they could so i don't know i guess the new pebble company is

going to be a hardware company because the software already exists so i don't know anyway

it's interesting that somebody i guess the same people are thinking like

let's give it another go um maybe this is the a better time because everybody's sort of

seen what the other ones are now from a watch os and a wear os and all that and it's like

we've had 15 generations of the same shit so we kind of get like what these ones are

so maybe it's actually better to launch after i don't know it'll be interesting to see what

happens with it maybe to be like the remarkable of watches like you can do everything on the apple

watch or in some way or another yeah i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know

other brand here but step back and have the digital bits that you want yeah and there's

there's like phones like that now that are starting to crop up that i've been looking at and may have

already uh pre-ordered um and it's just interesting to see where we're kind of going kind of backwards

now but forward at the same time so i don't know it'll be kind of cool i've also looked at um i'm

blanking on the name now but there's like because really the thing with the watch the apple watch

for me is i i still very much

am driven by like the ring thing like that has worked for my brain i it doesn't work for

everybody i get that and and yes the standing uh algorithm is shit but the idea of this ring

completion thing especially matched with like when we do the hemispheric views like fitness challenge

things that's the only thing in this entire universe that actually motivates me personally to

get off my ass

so

So for me, the ring thing is very important and that's the main reason I would not get rid of an Apple watch.

But I kind of have been looking at some of these other ones that are just more like they don't have screens or anything.

It's kind of back to the old Fitbit really, where it was just a thing that tracked kind of exercise and movement and that's it.

And I think that's kind of an interesting place also, because I do think, I know we talk, you know, we talk shit about the like, take your watch off and you'll die.

But I do think there is value in having consistent telemetry of your health for when something does go wrong, you have that baseline.

I do actually think scientifically that makes sense to me, that you can't just go in once a year to the doctor and they say, how's everything going?

And you're like, I don't know, good, I guess.

And they're like, cool.

Whereas if you have like a year's worth of data to actually look at and see that here's my baseline for X, Y, and Z, then you can actually find anomaly.

So I think that's actually good.

Everything else on the watch, take it or leave it, don't care.

But for me, the health stuff is a big plus, I think, for wearing this thing on my wrist every single day.

Fantastic.

I'm glad it's worked for you that way, because I had more fitness success when I used to write things manually in an Apple Note, I'll be honest.

Wow.

There you go.

Yeah.

I don't think it works for everybody, but for me, for some reason, it has clicked.

Well, I've been using the Apple Watch for a decade now, because what was it?

It was announced in 2015.

2014 came out in 2015.

After several years of it, I went, I can't take this anymore.

If you recommend one more brisk walk to close my rings at 11.58 p.m., I'm going to crush your watch.

You know?

So...

And what does crushing?

A foot does crushing.

True.

Yeah, not a force felt, not a magnet.

Yeah, I just found it became obnoxious in my life, but it is a good system overall.

Like, I think the visual aspect of it and the way that it fills the familiar calendar, I think it's a great system.

system. Like I used it for a while. It was more than notification aspect. I was like,

can you trust me as a human being to kind of just do it without the, and then I turned the

notifications off, but then I didn't think of it enough. So then that was my fault. And I kind of

contradicted myself and here I am and I'm blobular. See, I can't trust myself as a human. So I need,

I need the robot. Yeah. Yeah. What I love most about it, to be honest, other than notifications

and communication is music control. Um, I love that like around the house and home pods and

casts in the car and stuff. The fact that it's kind of like a mobile iPod remote on my wrist.

I love that. You know what else is a mobile iPod remote? An iPod. There you go. Good point.

Well, I can, I can, I can see your segue and raise you another segue with the next topic.

Please do. Because, because Martin was talking about

servicing batteries on his watch. Mine watch also needs a service battery, but you know what else

needs to be serviced? I think.

is my iPad.

Already?

Now, the iPad is really annoying in that it doesn't-

Work like a Mac and operate like a computer?

Well, yes.

But it's still-

I'm sorry, continue.

It's still the best for reading.

And I read a lot.

And unfortunately, most of that reading is probably not valuable books and educational

resources.

You know what else is good for reading?

An iPod.

It's not, Jason.

Dot TXT.

Just load that on your desktop, in your finder.

Yeah, I mainly read RSS feeds, sadly.

But, you know, I like that.

It keeps me busy.

Better than Instagram.

So, the problem is, when you look at the battery report on an iPad, there is no simple battery

health indicator, at least not on my version.

I think they might have tried to improve that on newer models, but I don't think it is being

pushed back to mine.

And for a while, there was-

I had a shortcut that would-

If you enabled logging, and then you ran this shortcut, it would pass the entire log saved

to the iPad and find the battery health indicator in there that would tell you what it was actually

reporting at.

And then that stopped working for a while.

But what I realized-

Oh, so it was a shortcut.

Yeah, exactly.

Yeah, perfect.

But yeah, I reckon my battery health on my iPad is probably-

Yeah.

I reckon my battery health on my iPad is probably about 80%, if not below.

And it's $205 to replace, repair, whatever they do.

My iPad.

This is an M series, right?

It's the M1.

Yeah, the first one with the M1.

The iPad Pro M1.

Yeah, I have the same one.

But it just-

It drains that-

That battery drains so fast.

It just goes-

I can leave it overnight.

And this has been a problem with my iPad forever.

You just leave it overnight, and the battery will just drain.

I don't know why.

I don't know what-

I think that's just an iPad problem.

Because I feel like the iPad sucks at battery management.

Yeah, yeah.

The iPhone's way better.

Am I wrong?

Really?

Okay.

Yeah.

So-

You two must use your iPads much more, because I use my iPad for a range of things.

But the only thing that I use it for regularly or consistently is editing this show.

In fact, I'll be honest.

I don't know if I could have sustained efforts in podcasting here or elsewhere.

Obviously, the interpersonal aspect helps.

But the editing thing, I don't think I could do it on anything else.

So I made that joke about a computer.

computer but for ipad like audio editing for this podcast and others it's the only way i'd do it but

maybe i just don't use it as much as youtube because i don't really have that drain like i

agree i agree with you like i have with my value of editing on the ipad like so if i edit this show

it would you know i've got a full battery by the time i'm finishing editing

it will probably be down to like a quarter battery left okay so so the question is when you service

your battery as well does it come back and is it still like is this because they don't have to take

the screen off and stuff like does the screen laminate get kind of like would you ever know

that it'd been done shouldn't no and i think they just swap them for the most part oh really just

give you a new one or refurb one i don't think they really do any kind of like live swaps of

any parts anymore they just put another one in a box and send it out i think that's what they do

with watches and phones just a new ipad just the computers

computers would

probably computers they'll usually actually swap parts i think still unless it's like a screen then

i think they just the whole top plate comes off but i think for the rest of them they just like

one comes in they send out another exact one that was already refurbished and then yours goes in the

pile to be sent to somebody else i think right okay obviously i've backward back back of room

knowledge yeah i was never sure about how that worked you know they just go like there you go

they used to they used to

like in the store they would just rip the screen off shove a new battery in there and like glue it

back in and like they'd say come back in an hour but i think the volume of repairs has become just

there needs to be like depots for this now i think look my answer to this question is yeah

you should service it if it's bothering you because whether it's replaced in a modular

sense like what jason said or it's a full swap you're doing the more sustainable thing and the

m1 at least in my experience just keeps on going the speed's great so

you're doing the right thing it lives on and then maybe when it really does die you know i actually

have a reason to get a new one and you don't have to enter something in your spreadsheet that's good

point in fact you could add a little note that says guess what value has improved i'm getting

better life out of this you could add a little footnote or appendix or whatever tickles your

fancy to make the spreadsheet even more exciting or a magnet note as they're known now i was gonna

say a failed note but yeah we both had the same thought either way

not a footnote

yeah i think that's a good point

you can add a failed note magnetize that thing

yeah so the answer is yes well that's good okay that's good i um i may progress that

task then it'll feel like a new ipad for a lot less money yeah and who doesn't deserve a new ipad

uh you you deserve a replaced battery

probably the most exciting topic of the whole show i've been dying for this and we've got

limited time left i'm gonna let you say to

andrew i'm just too i can't even say it i'm that excited speechless oh look i was so excited when i

found this too that not only did i save the article install the software where did you save the article

well i i saved i saved the article just in my rss feeder but then i linked to it in my own blog

because i wanted to share the good news canyon.blog slash uh hang on it's canyon.blog slash 2025

slash o2 slash o1 slash moss dash force dash smooth

you can see the article is a little bit more complicated than the article itself but i'm just

andrew i'm just a little bit more confused about the article itself but i'm just a little bit more confused about the article itself but i'm just

dash mouse dash scrolling dot html and is that the number four or for uh that that is um that is for

people can find that themselves okay yeah that won't be in the show notes yeah if if it's stated

if it's fully spelled out there's no need for it to be in the show notes there we go anyway this

this what i'm talking about here is an application called moss moss moss moose it's m-o-s m-o-s sorry

could you repeat that

say that's yeah okay was that n like m no m m for mary m for mouse okay o for o the o in a mouse

mouse and then s s for the s in the mouse the s and mouse okay it sounded like you said two s's

so we're going for one s here it's one s version 3.5 so it's m-o-1-s okay i've got you you got it

yeah m-o-1-s yeah like with the numeral one in there um and jason will love it because when you

go to its uh official website

which is a github page oh i'm already installing okay not only is it brew installable

it is brew installable that's how i did it oh thank goodness um you get an image of a cat

and and all the text is in japanese oh so it's sold it's jason software and what it does i

should probably get to the point why you would actually want this please software

okay yeah what what does this do for me if you are like me and you're not using

an apple mouse you're using something sensible like a logitech mx master 3 as we all seem to be

excellent good choice chaps you will know when you use that scroll wheel that in applications

it kind of chunk it does a chunky scrolling whereas if you scroll on a trackpad or the

apple mouse it's very smooth it's very smooth fluid scrolling almost like you're scrolling

an ipad you know but if you use a little ball a little roller on this

usually the scrolling is a bit clunky can i do a steve jobs and say you're scrolling wrong

mine is smooth as butter like the the wheel scrolls but the the stuff on the screen

kind of rat it's more ratchety it's more like a windows scroll it is different but i think like

i fling it like i spin it just goes and i just kind of just yeah yeah yeah if you just want to

do a little bit do you use clicky mode or like free free either way either way either way you

it's freewheeling or nothing or get out no i don't freewheeling or or you're a clicky boy

i'm clicky he's a clicky boy only because if i don't if i go freewheeling it sort of backslides

a little bit sometimes it's a bit of waiting it causes it to like fall back down that's the only

way to you're not living if you're not basically you've installed some moss or lichen into your

computer to make it scroll properly so now it scrolls as if i was using an apple product

i can't believe you guys don't are you guys using it

using logitech options or something yeah it's fine you use i don't use the logitech options i

also use steer mouse you've got a jenga tower of mouse software happening over there

um i'll put it in the show notes there is a air gapped version of logitech options

is there that doesn't do any of the ai stuff none of the calling back home stuff yeah i don't want

a 500 megabyte driver for my mouse it's not it's not that's

what's great about it it's like 20 megabytes like it's nothing and it works perfect that's

why i bought steer mouse which is another japanese software from like plenty calm yeah i think um

so i've had i was using one of those and then something went wrong and yeah well okay interesting

somebody somebody else obviously understands the problem otherwise they wouldn't have written this

software yeah and so if you have the problem of juddery scrolling then moz is for you

as in moz isley there we go oh there we go okay and if you're a clicky boy like andrew just click

that button right above the wheel to go into the correct mode which is freewheeling i'm so glad

that we've got another nickname to insert within andrew's name clicky boy clicky boy clicky boy

it's clicky boy and the freewheeling brothers that's what this show is called now

and they perform at the moz isley cantina

okay i think this

is another issue you're having is that the clicky he's a clicky boy so you probably should have the

3s because those mouse clicks are horrific on the three at on the three on the 3s they are silent

which is wonderful oh really um yeah it's i know you're a clicky boy but like the silent clicks so

nice i'm looking for a new mouse now quickly before we end on your uh gray version i didn't

even know there was a new version is it it's master 3s turning colors on you you're talking

about where you

grip with with your hands martin's going silent yeah like have you had it have you had it for a

while have i gone silent can you hear me all right martin yeah i can hear you all right see andrew

has everybody gone silent did i mean something yes have you had yours i have had mine for a

while but i found that when i like rubbed it i know rub the actual texture with my finger

a lot of it just lifted off yeah it's just like it like kind of has changed colors on me and it's
