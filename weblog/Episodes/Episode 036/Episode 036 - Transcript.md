Oh look at that, we have a question from member NBL Pocket Podcast on our Patreon.
Hmm? I've found it. Everyone happy?
Oh okay, okay yeah. I hope it's basketball related because I'm ready.
Okay, so as a one prime plus member, you can actually, you know, suggest topics or even ask
questions. And we may offer some advice or extend a conversation on the show. So
essentially boiling it down, NBL pocket podcast as a member has said, I want to replace my now
iPhone six with four years of adequate usage, but don't want to spend through the roof.
With little time or energy for admin, this particular member wants to know what our
advice would be to get a new phone not super interested in paying more than
one thousand Australian dollars which I can understand not cheap you know not
being cheap here just these phones are getting more expensive so what do we
recommend as the new replacement phone with that price bracket in mind it's
difficult because so I broke it down into three categories and and I won't
just rehash that but I've had more thoughts on it one the the idea that
it's not more than a thousand Australian dollars, I was actually confused that I
just assumed that was like the base price now for this stuff but maybe not
for like an SE2 kind of situation in Australia because that conversion just
is killer right? So I feel like anything that I would I would recommend from here
from my side almost doesn't even make sense because by the time it's converted
It's like, nope, that's too much.
That's too much.
Just remember our process is our tech's inclusive.
Okay.
Now, I guess that helps a little bit then.
Maybe my advice holds true then.
The one thing I would say is I at one point put out there that maybe just keep using the
current one with a new battery.
So just get a battery swap because at this point a six battery is probably only lasting
like 24 minutes.
I don't really feel good about that anymore.
As much as I like the idea of just put a new battery and keep going because it's doing
what you want, you're stuck on iOS 14 now probably or maybe, I think it runs iOS 14.
I could be wrong, but it's not going to run the next one.
So maybe you don't want the features, but whatever benefits you get from just security
and so forth and just that kind of area, that worries me when you stop getting updates.
So I think maybe I would throw that option out.
I think your only option really is the SE2.
But caveat, every year we get new phones in September.
So probably less than a month from now there's going to be new phones.
Yes you're not going to get the new phone, but whatever is the current phone will fall
down one rung on the ladder.
So what you're getting today might not be as good as what you get tomorrow for the same
money.
This is a really bad time to buy an iPhone, I would say.
You never want to buy an iPhone in August right before September, which is generally
when, you know, if the last 10 years is any indication, there will be a new iPhone in
about a month.
So at the very least, I would just do nothing until you hear what comes in this next one,
because you're probably gonna get more bang for your buck.
- See, it's interesting when you say that,
'cause I agree with you.
Like if I were to say,
which phone should you buy just full stop?
I would say iPhone 12 mini.
Obviously just paying attention to the current generation.
I think, you know, Jason, you have a mini.
You're a fan of that too.
But given that this member is only still using an iPhone 6,
I'm not sure if they necessarily care about what's new.
- Yeah.
So with respect to what you say about pricing, certainly if the pricing is going to get tossed
around and they're going to end up being slightly ripped off by getting something that's now
instantly outdated, I understand.
I think what I like about the SE2 suggestion is that even the absolute top model of that
particular range at 256 gigs is $929, plus the fact that it still has that iPhone 6 design,
so if you love that familiarity or that feel of the phone, it's essentially an iPhone 6
on steroids.
Or if you have a bunch of stuff that works with that 6, you know, places you put it in
your car or whatever, like it's still going to work.
I agree with everything you guys have said.
Just I'll just give you some little pricing points.
So at apple.com/au you can get the iPhone SE from $679.
The iPhone 12 is from $1199.
However, JB HiFi obviously bought too many iPhone 12 minis, which speaks to the worry
that they're not selling very well.
Because JB HiFi are selling an iPhone 12 mini 64 gigabytes for $899.
Australian.
Australian.
Wow.
So, you could get it 64 gigabytes, is that enough, is it not?
I'd probably go 128.
That's the one piece of missing information is what do you think if you looked at your
stats right now how much storage are you using?
Yeah.
64 is really not a lot.
I'm going to rule out 64.
Okay, so let's say you need 128.
That's at JB HiFi that's $979.
Yes.
Okay.
We did.
That's pretty good price for an iPhone 12 mini.
So is our verdict that if you can get a 12 mini for this particular user's case that's
the one to go for otherwise SE2 is the best budget option. I think so but even
with the 12 mini I can't imagine it's gonna be any more expensive than today a
month from now. Okay bit of follow-up. You recall we spoke about Yojimbo and
then we talked about Tot. So Martin you're a big proponent. Yeah that's a
good word. I'm into that. So I tried Tot and I liked it so much that I bought the
uber expensive iOS version
$31 worth of tot
That was a an eye-watering amount to pay on the iOS App Store
Let me tell you then I look at the download size
It was about seven megabytes and it's like couldn't you at least make it a hundred and seventy just to feel like I'm getting
more megabytes for my money
Damn the efficiency if it were electron though, it would be right
Exactly it's the counter-argument
So I've been enjoying taught I also yeah, yo Jimbo still had a place though
I was kind of enjoying yo Jimbo as a place to randomly put stuff
Is that in place of Devon think or is that what's that Devon thinks gone now, right?
Or are we still doing that?
Do we do we waver and we Devon think when okay, and it was I needed to find somewhere to put random bits of pieces
Especially like PDFs. I might clip from iOS or something. How did you get it out?
Where did could you import that into into?
the the new one or
How does that work or you don't really have to export anything?
It's just like a folder of stuff or something in your Jimbo Devon think Devin think oh, it's just folders
You can just grab them and get them out. Okay, so then you just have those in the agenda
I haven't I haven't done that but yes, you can and Jimbo, but your Jimbo
I was like, is it really the best that I went down an Eagle filer path from Michael?
sigh it's been around forever eagle phylo it's one i've always kept my eye on and then i realized
that eagle fire is just basically a it's just like a like a simpler version of devonthink and
so what i have devonthink why would i use eagle phylo i don't see the justification for that
sorry where was i i was basically now stuck between many places and i suddenly realized that
that Yojimbo was not doing it for me.
And I thought, Devonthink is still the best.
So what I did, okay, I have changed my approach a little bit.
So I've created in Devonthink, or yeah, in Devonthink, I've created a Devonjimbo section.
What?
Wow.
Wait, Yojimbo doesn't work for you?
So you've renamed your new Devonthink Yojimbo?
No, no, I've named it Devon Jimbo.
What does that mean?
Go on.
Well, because it's to remind me that I am to use this like your Jimbo, but it's Devon
thing, right?
So I just drop stuff in there.
And then what?
And then what happens?
And then I can find it later if I should ever need it.
I'm still just revisiting the idea that Jason and I subtly put forwards earlier.
What is wrong with the finder and/or a text editor that could contain text and then have
those things saved in the finder?
Because if I...
Okay, this is a classic example, right?
I had a newspaper or an article from a newspaper that I wanted to keep.
So I put it into ReaderView and then I printed as PDF.
Now where do I put that in the finder?
Do I create a folder?
I think they call it folders.
What do I classify it as? You could call it folder Jimbo if it makes you happy
Finder Jimbo
Find a Jimbo, folder Jimbo, whatever
Mac OS Jimbo
But when you look at it in the finder you don't get a nice three-pane view
You don't get to see the details of the file and then a preview of the file
Yeah, you can probably can be as soon as you select it. It shows up on the right
Yeah
You have the right pane that shows you what the preview is you could even have that gallery view like the old cover flow if you
It's never big enough. Well, you should just expand it to full screen and have find a permanently to the edges. I like windows
Yeah
Can I just ask quickly Devon right because I've never used Devon think is Devon think the Devon in Devon think is that referring to
the deli meat
No, it's referring to the company Devon technologies because I know nothing about it. Every time you say it I just think of Devon
Well, stop it. You're wrong
It is not a is not an application to the catalog meat
No, although I guess you could honestly as a kid
We always used to go to Ray Charles deli right in the suburb of fig tree where I lived and not victory fig tree
I'm saying I'm just saying that because Germans pulled me up on that one saying you live in the suburb of victory and I'm like
No, it's not victory. It's fig tree because there are big fig trees there
Anyway, we always used to get free Devon over-the-counter when I was like five or six years old
So you saying Devon thing over and over again? It's just triggering me for like deli meats
Yeah, and it's not Devon. Anyway, it's Piloni. Well either or I think if you're in Western Australia you say Piloni
I think we say Devon anyway continue so continue with Piloni think
So, okay
So I don't think that I'm gonna buy the license for your Jimbo the $20 light upgrade from my old version
I don't think I'll do that and I think I'm just gonna go back to
Devon think but but with a special database called Devon Jimbo Devon Jimbo
So do you have to pay licensing do you think on the name even though you're not buying a license to the app?
I'm concerned that there's gonna be a naming rights issue now that you've kind of co-opted the Jimbo
Portion do you think you have to pay him like ten dollars?
Just to I think they stole it from Kurosawa in the first place. So, okay
So you feel like this is like public domain at this point and it's it's it's a safe thing. Yeah
Okay, I think I can just yeah, I think I just go for it. Okay
So Devon Jimbo is now your database in
Devon Think that does exactly what it did before
Yes, but is named differently. Yeah, and and I'm not organizing it beyond just Devon Jimbo
Ah, so it's just one giant
It's as if your computer had a system built into it that could hold files all in one place
yeah, and then I
I don't even know if I dare go down this path.
Devon Jimbo to go?
Yeah.
Ah, I haven't yet gone back to that.
That remains deleted from my iPad.
And all I do is I say, okay, you'll like this.
You'll like this workflow.
If I find something on my iPad that I want in Devon Think, I save it into iCloud Drive,
which is Finder.
Yes.
Yes.
But it's a special folder in iCloud Drive.
- Called iCloud Drive Jimbo and everything's fine.
- It has an automation.
So that actually gets sucked straight
into the Dev and Jimbo inbox.
- It sounds very, very well thought out and streamlined.
So I like it.
- Thank you.
- I learned so much on this podcast with you too.
(laughing)
- I'm proud of it.
One day I'll do a screencast of my Dev and Jimbo workflow.
You could put it on our YouTube that we don't have yet.
- But we will.
- Now you know what?
Here we go.
Here's the official announcement.
- Oh.
- Hemispheric Views YouTube channel is going to launch
and the first video will be a screencast
of the whatever the hell Jimbo thing Andrew was doing.
How does that sound? - Devin Jimbo.
(upbeat music)
- But this month actually,
we have an interesting episode coming up on One Prime Plus
for anyone who already subscribes
wishes to subscribe we're going to be discussing photography and a very
specific app which has been doing the rounds recently recently called
Glass so if you're interested in that. Instagram! Oh yes Instagram is a big one yeah we might
mention that briefly probably not but yes if you're interested in hearing more
about our thoughts on Glass you should sign up and prepare for that extra
special members only episode. I got a new app I don't think anyone's ever heard of
it. Mm-hmm. Craft is the best app. I just wanted to throw that out there again. I've
started using it in new ways recently due to some changes in my life and it just gets
better and better every time I use it. Every time I use it, there's a new thing that's
just cool and useful and doesn't upset me. So there you go. Very, very good app. And
I guess I should probably tell you what that feature is. That's the daily notes calendar
looking view. So generally given a typical day for me I'd like to have a
running list of what's going on that day. But you don't necessarily want you know
365 notes a year cluttering up your regular notes right? Because a lot of
that stuff maybe you'll want it later but probably not. So there's this little
calendar view and you click on that and every day you have a fresh note and you
You can put all your stuff that's kind of in a separate place, yet when you search globally,
you can still find it.
And one step further, you can put tasks in there if you want.
I do.
I have a little expansion thing that does my top three things I'm working on for that
day, meeting notes, and then at the bottom, actions.
And I put my little actions in there and you think, "Oh, but really you want your actions
to be in things because that's where you keep all your kind of to-do-y stuff.
Like how am I gonna do that? I'm gonna copy and paste
Nope, I'm gonna select them hit the little send to things button
Boom craft creates all those things over in things for me
Done deal
freaking magic two question two questions
Yes question one question what how do you delineate what goes into a
Daily note versus what goes into a self-contained note. Generally daily notes are only
Interaction type meetings with other people. That's that's kind of how I break it down if this were like I'm doing research for
XYZ
product thing
That would probably just be its own note. I would I would think but yeah, it's generally meetings or interactions with other people
That will lead to there being some kind of output needed
That's kind of my daily stuff and usually that stuff you never need to go back to because I
Kind of try to at the end of that day make sure that all does something else
Right. There's not like I need to go back and reference something if I do need to reference it
Maybe it needs to be its own note second question
Yes
When you're writing these daily notes and each time each line or what have you is a new thought or a new event that happens
through the day. Are you assigning bullet points to those things or are you just starting
them as new paragraph? This may sound silly but I have a real issue with I never know
if it doesn't seem right if it doesn't start with a bullet but I don't like the way craft
renders its bullets and I wish it were an outliner. Or even the toggles because that's
a separate thing isn't it? Yeah that's what's annoying about it because yeah I just really
want it to be an outliner but it's not. Tell me, or do you just start writing like a sentence?
bullets. I find it easier to find information when it's all bullets versus
it being a paragraph. If it's a paragraph it's too hard to just quickly scan and
pick things out because they're really there it's kind of more shorthand notes
I'm not you know not recording meeting notes or meeting minutes or whatever the
hell people call them. It's just like boom quick little things so definitely
bullets. I think I might need an explanation as to what you've said that
several times that it's not an outliner. I feel like an outliner is just it's a
bullet and then there's like an indented one underneath it and then maybe another
indented one and then the next one's kind of out dented a little bit. It does
that. I don't what's not an outliner I don't I don't understand that part.
Because the toggles could kind of work that way couldn't they? Ideas within
ideas. Oh in the sense that you can like expand and can and oh okay I see what
you're saying. And also yeah you're right Martin that
And I had great excitement when I saw those little toggle triangles because they look outlinery, but they don't really behave in a like you can't quick.
If you want to be able to tab shift tab to bounce them back in and then you want to be able to command shift up and move like move them have the move of upper above one another.
So it's not keyboard driven is what you're saying.
Yeah, and then if you start to click and drag sometimes it'll it seems to sometimes not stick to the triangle that it's under
To it'll randomly bounce out and becomes its own thing. So it doesn't it's not they're not connected well enough
Okay, so you're you're more wanting like active participation in these notes as they're being taken and like live
My uh, like movement and stuff whereas i'm just like bullet bullet bullet bullet bullet
I don't really care what they look like.
It's more that I just need stuff on a page.
I see.
Okay.
So then no, it would not work in that sense for you.
Yeah, it's more just bullets.
- That remains my holy grail that I continue to look for
and not quite find one to my satisfaction.
A daily note that's an outliner that does everything else.
Everything is so close, craft, Dynalist, Omni Outliner.
Just mush them together.
I think that might be a feature for me,
that it doesn't do all that stuff,
because then I feel like I would just get hung up on,
oh, this should be above that,
and this should be inside of,
oh wait, this should actually be a child of that,
or a parent of this.
It's just like, I think I would get too hung up on that.
It's like you're living inside my brain.
Yeah, yeah.
Making sure everything is in correct buckets,
and indented, and so forth.
And then I can put in all my little, my little horizontal rules and so forth.
I love a horizontal rule and a note.
I gotta tell you, if, if a note thing doesn't have a horizontal rule,
Hmm, that's a, that's a deal breaker.
So let's put a line onto things.
Yeah.
I love, I love a line.
I love a good line.
Just, and I love that craft has three different widths of lines.
So you can be like, I'm just sort of wanting to put a line here.
Or like I'm putting a line here.
I mean serious line business with this one.
Okay.
- So when you were at school, okay,
did you have your inches?
What's all that about?
30 or 40 centimeter ruler.
Sorry, I have to go with the metric here.
And were you like doing--
- 12 inch, 12 inch ruler.
- 12 inch ruler, one foot.
- 12 inch.
Now I'm just thinking of like a subway sandwich.
Okay, so did you have the equivalent of a subway sandwich
and just like draw lines underneath bits of text
that you finished in your school books?
- Probably.
- Did you actually do horizontal rules?
Don't remember, but I bet I if I had a 30 centimeter ruler
I bet I would have done at least a 29 centimeter line on a paper for sure
Did you rule margins as well vertical left-hand margins? No, but I would write little symbols in the margins
To denote different things so like maybe a star would go in like symbols go in the margin. No, not anything else
But oh, so you already had pre-ruled margins is that you ruled margins?
That's great because I remember very very strictly at primary school
There was the rule that you would have the one centimeter gap from the left was is the same for you Andrew
Before ruling you would actually you would have to get your ruler and put a little dot the top and do it at the bottom
Put a little dot then flip your ruler
Line up the dots and then draw the line down. Yeah, very satisfying
Yeah, they should have like figured out that you could put those lines on there during the paper manufacturing process
I think they did it was probably just a form of like societal child control
It's like it's get them really focused on ruling this page with like between two dots
Yeah, we've got their attention for a limited time
Okay, you've reminded me about something. I haven't thought about in ages how I used to do my my writing
It's probably high school, but I used to you'd have
The fault the folder paper, you know, it would be a reinforced paper. It would be pre-ruled
It would have the margin when a new lesson came along. I wouldn't start a new sheet of paper
I would do two line two horizontal lines Jason style
He's looking happy with that and then that then that would become basically my header for the next section and I'll put a date on
The left I would put the title of the topic the lesson in the middle and then just carry on
One line space and then start my writing. That's exactly what I used to do when I did work notes on paper
Yeah, it would just be a continuous
Thing it just felt like such a waste because sometimes there'd only be like a little bit on the next page
It's like what do I do with that that extra space?
I'm not gonna come back to it, and I don't want to just leave it blank that just seems rude
So yeah, you just continue on maybe I should just go back to that that was really successful
I spent years with that system, and it worked
Do you still have some of those paper resources filed somewhere? I did for years, but they're no more
paper Jimbo
Paper Jimbo, it's time to get paper Jimbo happening
And there's no subscription fee for that except for the purchase of tangible paper goods
I bet you could find a paper thing that has a subscription
There's got to be some kind of like super hipster II note-taking thing where you can get like a subscription journal or something
There's gotta be right? Yeah, it's like an untapped market if there isn't. Oh important question. What were your rulers made from?
I think in the beginning they were the wood with the little little metal thingy like
Embedded in the edge so you could actually draw a straight line
Then once you actually figured your life out and realized that those sucked you're like all in on the aluminum ruler
with the little
Cork kind of stuff on the back of it. So it would it would it would yeah
Those are like those are the good ones pork on the back of it. I'm not even sure if I'm saying that
I don't know what the purpose of it was
But it made it sit real nice on the paper and you could move it around
Nicely and like so if you were gonna draw a line and then move it and draw a line
It wouldn't stick or tear on the paper. It was very nice. Those those were probably the top Wow
What about you Andrew?
Started off with a wooden one in primary school. I had sort of almost the embossed
Numbers and dashes in them embossed
Yeah, it was like almost premium
Seared in the numbers seared into the wood. Yeah, you could run your finger over it and feel it then I graduated to plastic
I was very particular about my rulers as well. Probably come as no surprise to anybody
I'm very never wanted. Yeah, never wanted any vandalism to happen to my ruler
I looked after it because if you didn't want even when a little chunk in it
and I
Cared for my ruler greatly. Do you do you remember every time they have a weaponized?
I'd go to like draw a line with a sharpie or something and you'd accidentally write on it
It's like end of the it's the worst thing is when you ask that I just did that recently on a
Ruler in the garage. I don't really it's it's like a four-foot ruler
with it like a T square on the top. Oh the T square. Yeah, and I was drawing with a sharpie and
Look away for one second and all of a sudden you've got a little sharpie line on your nice crisp blue ruler
What do you do? You gotta sand that back and you know fix up the T square. It's really bad and oh
Oh my god, I just realized too one time I bought a ruler
That I didn't even need at all because have you seen those like triangular rulers where they have like
three fins in like a triangle shape and then each side measures different
things have you seen this? I don't know what they're actually for
they're for some kind of advanced ruling that I never needed but it just seemed
like such a cool ruler that I had to have one. You don't think you have a
mathemat? Do you know what a mathemat is? No. Mong, you familiar with a mathemat?
No, I'm gonna have to look it up now. Mathemat. I hope that's what this is
called. Mathematics are amazing. It's got three fins so you can lay it flat and then you can turn
it to the next side and then each edge has different measurements. Oh I think I know what
you're talking about. It's yeah it's like it looks like a Toblerone almost. Yes yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah yeah yeah with kind of concave yes on each side yeah I'm with you now I'm with you. I was
gonna say because I looked up the Mathemat and it says set of Mathemat for children and it looks
like some sort of color-coded thing with post-its on top of it. I was very confused.
Sounds like they've dumbed it down considerably since my day.
It used to have all the different geometric shapes in it and it would also have conversion tables
and rulers printed onto it. Very handy.
See as far as rulers go, and I'm actually I shouldn't be surprised that I'm still the only
one, I was pretty much the only one at school I could remember from what I can recall who had
a completely metal ruler and looking back that thing was dangerous like oh
yeah if I'd gone to school with a knife people would have said this child needs
to be you know disciplined it was essentially just a flat sword all the
time and it was ready to cut me open at any point but it was kind of a thrill to
know that you were using essentially a weapon to rule your margins did you
ever take it out into the playground just I think I hacked a branch or two
once yeah I think so okay well those and those rulers they weren't even aluminum
I think they were all stainless steel.
So they were like really beefy for just drawing a line.
It was a little questionable as to why those were as robust as they were.
Forged by the blacksmith of office works.
Yeah, pretty much.
Yeah.
So speaking of, um, of mathematics, Andrew, you just basically spent like half of
WA's GDP last week or this week.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
So what's up with that?
You, you never buy anything.
And now all of a sudden I'm getting messages of like, I got this, I got that.
And JB Hi-Fi, I bought the whole store.
Yeah, it was, it was Saturday and Hannah and I were a bit, was it Saturday?
It might've been Sunday.
No, it was Saturday.
I'm waiting for the adjective.
Hannah and I were a bit...
Bored.
Bored.
I was going to say drunk.
No, we were just bored.
And we're looking at our TV and it's a TV that we've been talking, talking about.
needing to replace at some point in the future for a number of years already
We looked at each other and said let's get a new TV
Basically
Okay, so
Because it'd been one of these things I've been putting off as well because it didn't want to do the research project
About what's a good TV, which is surprising to me because that's the fun part like buying TV is just kind of
You could have made an outline and then you could have had the pros and cons
And oh, it's just too many. There's too many. I didn't even know the what whatever
I'm too far out of the world to know what even matters. So I did the next best thing. I didn't do any research. I just
Think I said I sent Jason a message and I said Jason what's a good TV? And what did you say Jason? Do you recall?
I don't I think I probably just said whatever one I had
Okay, well, it was good
So that I was that's good. Yeah, sorry Martin
No, not at all. I just wanted to make you feel bad keep going you don't draw it
You don't draw diagrams of your network topology either
So you got a pick?
Okay, damn it. So and then I so I repeated back to Hannah
I said Hannah Jason has said that the LG is the one to get
So, okay, so we checked we checked online
we looked at JB hi-fi and
Then we ended up going to the good guys because it was we didn't have to cross over the busy road to get to them
And they had it for the same price
That's JB. Hi-fi good guys like the good guys
Is it called the good guys or good good guys?
They're good guys their jingle used to be to the tune of good vibrations. We went there. We went walked in
Found the TV that Jason recommended
Looked at it happened to be the only TV in the store. It was turned off
Which is a little bit of a worrying omen
We talked to the sales guy he came over and asked us you know, it's anything you'd like to ask and said well
Yeah, can you turn that TV on?
So he turned it on I looked at it was like now it looks good. Yeah, Jason obviously knew what he was talking about
Yeah, that's the price and we said to him. Okay, we'll take it. It was the easiest sale that this guy had made probably forever
Well, he did have to turn it on though. That was he did
And he had a whole bunch of remote controls like glued to a his hands board
He had this big wooden board with a whole sequence of remote controls stuck to it
So he could choose the right from a controller Edward Siri hands
So so point you to be the biggest the greatest negotiation is can you get it to us today?
I said we live literally a kilometer or two away, but that thing will not fit in our car
Yes, they could they did it arrived and away we went
It's ridiculous when you get some of these TVs the box that they come in to putting the stand on was the most
Oh my god, that was scary. They are so it's terrifying. It's so thin. So it's an LG for people who care
It's an LG
C1 OLED
65 centimeter. Yeah, 65. Or is that inches? That's still inches.
I was like 65 centimeters. You could measure that with your school rule.
I think that's your iPad.
It's very nice. But yeah, it's so thin.
And then to put the stand on, you have to lay it down.
Yeah. Right. Which is the first thing, right?
That's nerve wracking.
Then you realize you can't put the stand on unless it's not only laying down,
but hovering slightly off a surface
to enable the angles of this stand to be put on and screwed in.
You almost have to clear a table, put a towel or cloth down
so that the edge of the TV is off it so that the stand is the thing that's hovering.
Is that right?
Yeah, yeah. But it was and but then because we didn't realize that at first,
we had to kind of lift it again.
And you're watching this sort of screen flex a little bit
and you stick your hand right under it to try and support it.
It just petrified you to snap it in half.
Yeah, I don't want to go down this whole path, but this is where if Apple had made a final product,
like television, that you could buy, you could bet that it would have come out perfectly complete,
and you'd have those little pull tab bits of paper that go all the way around, and you wouldn't have
had to do this. Yeah. Because I have an LG, I think what we all have LG OLEDs now, is that right?
I'm gathering that. Oh, did you have an LG OLED as well? Do we have the same TV?
Is it the same one?
I have a 55 inch from 2017 or 2018.
Okay, so mine's obviously a bit newer, but I think the C1 is because it's 2021 and the
CX was from 2020, C9 was 2019.
I think they do a pad of it.
So it's probably a C7 since it's 2017.
Something like that, yes.
But it's lovely and I never notice anything wrong with it.
And yeah, one of the best things I've ever owned.
It's really weird how the top part is effectively just a piece of glass.
And then the only like meat of the TV is way, way down.
It's kind of like, it's almost like an iMac kind of thing.
See what they should do, I can imagine, let's say Apple were to do this, you can imagine
that the TV would come completely assembled, it would be fixed to the stand already, and
I can just imagine that like some beautiful origami lotus, the box would flip out, fall
apart. Fall apart and the TV would just be in the middle ready to pull up with
some sort of grab handle system. It wouldn't be this "yeah congratulations
you've just spent thousands of dollars prepare to break this thing"
yeah and I had to go on YouTube to figure it out like is the little
diagram of how to put together was so bad I don't want to stuff this up. That's
why the TV was $5,000 instead of $50,000. You know what was worse? It's when you
sit then you have to spend hours trying to set it up and you cannot for the life
of you get the full surround sound system to work properly and all the
inputs and outputs going into your Yamaha receiver until you finally
realize "oh great, my Yamaha receiver is from like 2013 or 2014 or
something and it doesn't support all the new stuff that this TV is pumping out" so
So you have to go back to another store and purchase another piece of equipment.
You gotta get that Dolby Vision and Dolby...
Dolby Everything.
What's the other one?
Dolby Atmos.
Atmos.
Yeah, you gotta get that.
Atmos.
Which I don't...
I've only got...
I don't have this...
I don't even have surround sound.
I've got 3.1.
So it's not that I'm doing anything miraculous, but still, you needed a new receiver.
So I had to go out again, another store.
This was from West Coast Hi-Fi.
Had a good deal on the Denon.
A Denon receiver, just a low-end one, but more money spent.
So I have just spent like crazy.
- Man.
- How's your cable situation?
- I totally overpaid for an HDMI cable, knowingly, 'cause I couldn't be bothered.
The first one he showed me, and I said, "How much is that gonna be?"
"150 bucks."
Get out of town!
- For an HDMI cable.
I'm not paying $150 for an HDMI cable!
And he looked at me like, "Yeah, no you're not."
So I think that was almost like a condition of sale that they had to try and sell this
ridiculously priced one.
But then he was so nice, so he brought out the next one, still way too much money.
I overpaid, I couldn't be bothered at that point.
I was just like, "Yeah, give it to me.
I'll just take it."
And so that was $50, which I know is too much for an HDMI cable still.
Now I'm up and running and the best news of all these guys
Everything was budgeted in one app. No debt hangover been saving for years for this stuff
So the money was just sitting there in its one app category waiting to be
Provisioned is everyone in the household happy with the new television
Yes, except they still trying to figure out which of the inputs, you know
HDMI 1, HDMI 2, you know, then it's got the smart TV overlaid on top of it and all that kind of stuff.
See, I have to step in because I've now been dubbed not only Felderfoot but also Mr. Default, right?
This is where if you eliminate all potential products from your home entertainment unit
other than the Apple things, you have no such problems.
If you completely submit to the Apple TV lifestyle and either connected speakers or home pods
You never ever have to worry about anything again. So I'm not telling you to throw out all of your stuff
But it could be helpful
Yeah, Jason said to throw it all your stuff
Do you know the best thing about all this TV the one I was most excited about was not watching TV at all
But entering these new items into the depreciation schedule
I've got a wife who just wants to watch a TV show and I'm like, well we can't yeah, and then I've got it working to
Remember because the receiver wasn't working right so I could get the I got the audio working in one half
But then you'd switch over and there'd be no audio and it was so and then you'd go and reset everything and it's like do
I want it do I want the audio to be passed through or auto and
nightmare nightmare nightmare, and then finally it was working it was in stereo and
Hannah's like well I can watch that well no honey you cannot because this is not you you're hearing stereo, but that's not stereo
You should be hearing
3.1 sound
It's not right. So but she's like, well, I can hear it. No, you can't hear it
You're hearing it, but you're not hearing it
So yeah, so that whole night then that night was researching which receiver do I want to buy?
I did more research on the receiver than the TV and then having to wait the next day
To 12 o'clock when the shop opened. This was a Sunday that I opened to 12 o'clock
Rushing down there and getting it and then getting visits
From my own mother and my mother-in-law preventing me from actually finishing the setup. I mean, it's like they love you or something
It was horrendous. It was horrendous
Can't believe them just want a time alone visits from relatives horrendous entering data into a spreadsheet
Thumbs up!
