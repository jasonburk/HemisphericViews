*Song plays*
So, how much time have we used? Episode 32.
*Squeak*
Oh, screaming in the background.
Oh, tantrum is picking up steam again.
If anybody hears that, you know what it's like to have a five year old.
He's probably just mad that the show hasn't actually started yet. That's probably what he's that's the real complaint because he's probably listening live
He does listen to the one where I mentioned his birthday. That is like on the
Probably of all our downloads. I'm accounting for about two-thirds of those
That explains those exploding numbers and downloads for that one episode
Okay, so if we mentioned his birthday every episode we've got a dedicated listener. Oh, yes. He'll become a patron in no time. Oh
Man, this is looking good
If anyone's listening if anyone's listening right now and is not a patron
I will mention your birthday a couple of times even probably
If you want to join at one prime plus dot-com
Nailed it. I was driving around the other day thinking about that URL and just thinking how good is that URL?
Like it's really cool. I'm so proud of I think it's probably the best thing we've done
Hmm Wow high bar low bar low bar medium bar. We'll say the bar is somewhere in the middle
It's a bar. Yeah, it is. There is a bar somewhere
Maybe Andrew was driving to that bar. We're not sure but we're driving home from the bar
All that we know is that he was driving around he was just driving around to think in his sorry
This is the camera yet or not. Oh, oh, do you want Toyota update?
Toyota factory I forgot what that term is called corner lean manufacturing
It's it's finished being manufacturing. It's probably on a boat as we speak
Probably traveling from Japan where I'm hoping that may I hope they're making in Japan if I find out it's made in like some other
Asian locale not Japan Japan. I'm gonna be highly disappointed
But let's assume for the sake my argument. It's going from Japan on the waters
somewhere in the Indian Ocean perhaps
coming to Perth for
arrival
Around the 20th of July so a week from now
Few days for the dealership to get it ready
And then I get it
Hmm got put that true coat on put the floor mats in. Oh, yeah floor mats. Yeah, I got a good deal on those
Yeah, yeah
Every single piece of the car that was probably already in it that they took out to put back in
Just so they could charge you $100 for it. I love that. It's such a it's not a scam at all totally worth it
Ah car dealers. Well when you eventually receive it once you've you know
Opened every door and look for those little metal
Plaques or labels or whatever that they put on things with the serial numbers if you can actually find where it was manufactured
Okay, I'd like to know that's my mission. I would do it's probably like Alabama here
But we'll let you think that it's you know coming
Straight out of Japan probably. At least it's not coming from South Australia
Mmm sick burn for the Australian listeners there. Love our South Australian listeners. Love you guys
I went to an Attila festival there. It was brilliant. See
Martin's got you. They do festivals well
Arcadia what's going on with that? Oh
Well, it's called Arcadia June in case you didn't notice which means it's in June and it's now July
therefore it is over but
Good news just to post it. We just posted all of the
detailed
Winner information yesterday. So if you haven't looked check that out, I think it's posted everywhere at this point
On your usual social areas you do a blog post and
And oh, that's a good idea.
That'll be put that in the notes.
Yeah, please someone put that in the in the to-do list in our can ban.
How about we do a blog post about how we did a craft document?
Ooh, look at that.
It's all fitting together.
But the the winners are posted announced.
I'm not going to announce them there.
You got to go look at all the at all the highly skilled put together data.
But that being said, do look and see if you're a winner because you will be getting an email from me shortly
asking for your address of where to send your newly acquired
prize for winning Arcadia June!
So Arcadia June was a joke to start. It actually turned out to be really cool.
We got a lot of people joining in to play all the different games.
we talked to the developer of the game and it all just kind of
Snowballed into this like cool community thing. So thanks everyone for actually joining and playing and I hope we can do
Something vaguely similar in the in the future. I don't think it'll be you know, insert name of new game
insert name of month, but
Something like that was it was fun to be able to have a bunch of people doing something that was the same
But it was very casual and it wasn't a lot of commitment
And I think that game lent itself to that where you could just jump in play real quick
Throw in a score to discord and leave and not be like now I've got a new job
so and of course no one knew that there was gonna be you know, any kind of
Winners or prizes at the end and that's just kind of how we do things around here
Not to mention if listeners are joining in and maybe they missed some previous episodes
If you go back to episode 31 just before this one you can hear a full-on interview
With Irene who co-developed or co-created the app with Raffaella
Really really nice of her to join and on top of that as far as I'm aware
It should be available for everyone because we've been enjoying it
You can now actually get the app for tvOS so you can play it with your Siri remote or
Controllers so check it out. Yep. It's about the only probably the only game that works effectively with the Siri remote
There you go, boom Arcadia June
I have a new list that I keep of things that I come across in my day-to-day life
Maybe not personally maybe just things I see
That I feel might be very
US centric and not
Translate into the southern world
And I'm just curious about them and in terms of how you all
interact with these items. So the first one, pretty on the, let's see how can I say this,
it's pretty common here, but depending on locale. So air conditioning in a home specifically,
not in a car, not anywhere else, not in buildings, in your home. Where I lived previously, pretty
much everybody, that was like a pretty common thing that everybody just sort of had that.
the degree that in the summertime when everybody would fire those things up the
power would go out because everybody just sucked all the power out of the
grid and that was the thing that happened quite often. Now where I live
it's quite the opposite where almost no one has it by design because the
location doesn't really require it except last week when we had this crazy
heat wave where it was a hundred and I think it hit a hundred and fifteen
degrees Fahrenheit I think that's about 45 degrees Celsius yeah about that yeah
it's like a few degrees off of being I think on the Sun directly and I was like
wow I was really glad that we actually still have air conditioning here
fortunately I feel terribly for anybody that did not because it was just it was
brutal. It was so hot. It's not a thing that happens here. But is that a
thing in Australia where I think the perception is it's as hot as the sun
all summer and most of the year probably. So you've got the hot, you've got the
animals. Is air conditioning a thing in Perth and/or the Gong? I can
In Perth it is very much a thing.
Most houses, every new house that's built will have it installed.
Most other houses have it retrofitted in some way, shape or form.
There's really three approaches you can take to air conditioning.
You can have the whole home central, like ducted air conditioning, ducted refrigerated
air conditioning, which is most expensive to install and most expensive to run.
That is certainly very uncommon a little while ago.
I think it's becoming more common now in the in the houses built in the periphery on the
edge of the edge of the hinterland where they there's not many trees and it's just houses
and houses and I think that's the kind of approach they go with.
The other approach is you can do split system, reverse cycle in different rooms.
I had that in my old house.
We had one system in the lounge room area and then another smaller one in the bedroom
and you just turn them on as required and they do a nice job of refrigerating the room.
The final option is one that in Perth used to be very common, is still common but is
probably slightly less effective and it's the one that we have in our home
now. It's cheap to run, cheap to install and there's ducted evaporative air
conditioning. That's where you have a big thing on the roof which is basically a
fan that gets water sprayed down it. The wet, the fan sucks the hot air from
outside, it passes over the wet pads, gets ducted into your home and so you get
cool moist air pushing through your home. Ironically with that air conditioning
system you need to have doors and windows open at the same time you use it
otherwise you end up with a pressurized home and you may blow your roof off.
Wow okay so I... hey how come I know nothing about this? I had no idea that I
was on a call with a air conditioning expert / salesman who just tried to sell
me air conditioning I think I'm not sure now I can hook you up with any of three
of these systems which is like our first split system ducted I recommend Fujitsu
maybe Dakin Wow oh I was gonna say Fujitsu you got to watch out Mark
Taylor that's uh he's been the brand ambassador for how long now 20 years
by the way Jason now we have that we so we have the ducted evaporative which is
very pleasant but the problem is as Perth becomes more humid with the
changing environment, they work less effectively. They work really well with
dry heat, which is traditionally what Perth has. Like we would get days,
consecutive days, of over 40 degrees or 100 degrees in multiple days in a row.
And usually in those sorts of days the evaporative works really well, but when
it's humid and muggy it just is ineffective. I have a question. Sorry
Andrew, I just want to know because look I live on the same continent as you, same
Nation right and I don't really know anything about this evaporative a bomb
that you're describing that could blow off your roof yes when you say wet pad
that is a very bad image I want to know is Legionnaires an optional extra
Legionnaires used to yeah it was a big problem you got to make sure you keep it
clean and you want to get serviced every now and then what the what our system
does is it actually dumps the water every now and then so it doesn't it
prevents that build up. No it's got a drainage system and it refills it
refills pumps fresh water over the pads and away you go again then recycles it
for a while and then dumps it. So are you getting up onto your roof are you getting
up onto your roof and kind of like topping this up the way you do with an
iron you're going through like a little. It's all automated it's got a system for
all that it did break one time had to get it fixed but yeah it's pretty okay
It looks after itself quite well. Thank you for accepting my can of worms that I didn't realize I was presenting and
Apologies to anyone who did not want an in-depth master class on
The wonders of air conditioning. Well, what do you have in your house?
I'll do one short follow-up question and then I'll answer your question
Okay, air conditioning. Does that extend into winter for heating? Is it?
Heating and air conditioning generally or are those generally two separate things so if you've got one of the the first two options
I mentioned this the whole whole house whole house system or the split system. They can do heating
Climate control heating our one being the povo option is just it's just for the summertime
And just to clarify for our international listeners povo means
Cheap it's like poverty the poor person's option
Hmm he went with option three got it okay?
I was just gonna reply to your your inquiry we have the kind that makes hot air and cold air and
Throughout the house great ducted through the house and we have course you do yes
if Americans gonna do it they're gonna do it properly and
Damn the cost and the expense damn the environment yeah, no it we so when we moved in we actually replaced the one
that was here with the
I guess there's different tiers of efficiency on them and it's like you can get the 80% or the
92% or whatever
And we ended up getting a brand all brand new one. That was the I think it was like the
Middle ish one. I think it's like 94% or something
but
Yeah, so the one we had was garbage and we put in a new one that's
Much much more efficient and we don't honestly use it that much but sure as hell. I'm happy
We had it last week Martin. It sounds like you need to talk us through the concept of inverter technology
When it comes to air conditioners now sounds like maybe Jason's taking advantage of inverters
Inverters look I mean most of what I would talk about would be our specific split system
I don't know if that actually fits nicely with what you're talking about if you go
Yeah, well if you've got a half-decent split system, it's probably an inverter one if it's built recently
It sounds like you know a lot more about inversion than I do so before I talk about my split system
Would you like to give us a rundown on the schematics of my system?
Your system you say you'll have an installed piece that there is like a bar. I'll get a large box kind of
Rectangle hanging from your wall somewhere outside. You look quite nice. It'll have a digital display. You'll have a remote control
It'll have a louver fan
Outside of your house, you'll have a large box
How did you know which is basically the heat exchanging unit and that is?
giant fans that suck in cool the air or heat it as required and then transfer it to that
Unit inside your house. So they're all the noisy bits outside
decoupled from the the blowy bit inside
You have the okay there finally he used terminology. I understand the blowy bit
I know that everyone knows what blowy means. Do you have a whole do you have a whole like Devon think?
Thing of air conditioning schematics, you know, I'm actually surprising myself with how much I realize I know
Conditioners because I've done no research for this. This is all just off the top my head just to be clear
Which brand are you running? Oh, ours is a breeze air a breeze air a brassiere
I think we have a lot luxe luxe air. Is that right? I don't know. I don't I
Have about 1% of the knowledge that that you have
But thank you
Martin, what do you have? Well to speak to speak briefly about my split system
you were completely correct in your description of the split system the noisy bit is outside and
And the blowy bits inside. Yeah, the blow bits inside. We love the blowy bit
The blowy bit is exactly what we wanted in the air conditioner.
You don't want them the other way.
You don't want the noisy bit inside and the blowy bit outside.
That's no good.
You got to move your TV outside then to get away from the noise.
Yeah.
Terrible.
Right.
No, it's all bad.
What a nightmare.
What a nightmare.
Yeah.
Well, I just want to, I want, I have a bone to pick with air conditioners in
general.
Look, I love the air conditioner as it stands.
I like that it fulfills its blowy purpose.
It does the cooling job.
It does the heating job to answer your question.
We use it summer and winter time.
We're very lucky that our actual place
is well shielded by trees,
so we can run it in a moderate kind of fashion
on one of those eco settings.
The button that I have to pick with air conditioners though
is with the remotes.
I don't know who's designing these remotes.
I don't know whether it's all a prank
and they're trolling us or what's going on,
but it's like they've designed it to have a lot of buttons
that mean sort of the same thing.
And then the things you think will mean one thing
actually mean the opposite. So do you have something on your remote controls
or your wall panels or whatever you have, Andrew, on your intricate analog pulley
system that you're running with your wet pads? You know like the swing and set
functions where you can have them... okay it wouldn't be the case for you Jason
because you have the ducted or whatever, but when you have the split system and
the things on the wall you have these little fan things, these little
directional fins that tell the air where to go. Louvers, that's the one,
thank you. And you can have them swinging to disperse the cooling blowy air around the room
or have it go in a certain direction. Whenever I go to swing or set I think I'm setting but it
keeps swinging and I'm almost wondering did they program it the wrong way around so you think you're
going to make it swing but the swing actually sets it and vice versa. I don't know what's going on
and what powerful or eco means because they sound equally noisy and sometimes it just seems like
it's stopping and starting. I want to know who's designing this. Do you know
what I want to get annoyed about? So often you go to a hotel or maybe not
hotel, hotels are wrong. You go to a farm stay you know something that's a
freestanding holiday home okay. This is this is before your yacht trip or? Yeah
yeah well you know you go to these places and and they'll have one of these
split system units in them and they are always they've been driven to an inch of
their life they're always programmed set at like 16 degrees they always have half
the louver bits have been snapped off and you run it at 16 degrees and it
never gets anywhere near 16 degrees and it's like they never get serviced ever
ever ever and I think who is destroying these air conditioners when people visit
people are just generally bad and don't take care of things and the temperature
that's displayed never really matches what comes out it's like talking about
cars for one thing when for some reason you go below 16 and then you just get
LO for low and I'm like what the hell is low is low 12 is low 8 how many degrees
Celsius or Fahrenheit have we skipped to get to this thing that is called low and
is noticeably more freezing than what came before I don't know I just I
didn't lie I didn't like it I don't like it when people turn it right down set
the temperature you want it to be at use the device and control it properly don't
just say I want 16 degrees because you don't. I do that. I do. I set it to sub zero which
is low. I just ask Siri to do it and then it does it. Is yours integrated with HomeKit?
Of course it is. So it only works half the time? I have an app to talk about real quick.
It's brand new. I'm not sure if you guys have heard of it. It's called Instapaper. Have
Have you heard of that? It's like pretty new. Um,
I think it was made in like 2006. So right on the, you know,
new hot apps category probably hasn't been covered by close to anyone.
I imagine. Uh, it's very esoteric.
It like gets articles and you can read them later kind of thing.
I think this is a new trend in the internet. Read it later. Um,
cause there's just so much content.
You're on the cutting edge, Jason. I've always admired that about you.
Yeah, bleeding edge tech is what they call me.
It's about time because I'm sick of reading now, to be honest.
Half joking, half not. I literally just started using Instapaper.
I guess I've had an account since the beginning.
But I kind of got, I was using this other one, Goodlinks.
I don't understand it at all. It doesn't seem to do anything for me.
Sorry for anyone that loves Goodlinks.
I just don't understand what purpose it serves.
It just seems like it's making bookmarks.
Like I have that already.
Delicious for the modern world.
So this all happened because Martin gave, gave us homework to read this article.
On the member show, which you should, uh, check out one prime plus continue.
Jason.
Yeah.
So I was like, how am I going to read this article?
I can't just read it in the browser, like an animal.
That's crazy.
Like who would do, who would just read it right there?
So I spent, I think the article is, it's very short.
It maybe is like a 10 minute read, something like that.
So instead of just reading it for 10 minutes,
I spent probably like two and a half hours
figuring out where I could put this article
so I could read it, you know, somewhere else.
'Cause you just don't, you know, I wanna read it there.
Two hours later, and it does this weird thing
which I think is a catalyst thing where,
I don't know if this happens to you with Discord ever,
but when you hover over the top of the window
to go to the little three stoplights and you click the red one to close the damn window
yes and it does nothing it's like everything in the menu bar is like there but not clickable
until you click back on the the like other part of the window and then come back to the
the navigation uh pane then those become usable and i thought it was just a weird discord
thing, but I'm starting to realize that I think it's something to do with, and I
could have the terminology wrong, but I believe it's something to do with this
catalyst-y stuff. Because every app that is very clearly a catalyst app, and
usually you can tell by when you go to system preferences and it's like this
kind of weird, I think it's a modal window that comes up in the middle of
the app that doesn't look like a normal Mac OS preferences window, that's usually
a tell that it's, I think, catalyst is the correct term there.
And I think GoodLynx is a victim of that too, because it does the same thing where you go
to click the red go away button and it doesn't work until you do the other one and then come
back.
And then the other symptom of that is when you do click that, the whole app closes and
completely goes away.
Sorry, Jason, you've just triggered me on about three different things that drive me
crazy on that.
Yeah, I know.
The red thing where you click it and it doesn't do anything.
Apple's own inconsistency about whether it closes an app or closes the window.
They can't decide.
So half their things do one thing, the other half do the other.
Yeah, the red thing drives me nuts.
But anyways, GoodLynx did that and I just, I couldn't handle it anymore.
So I went down the hole of, you know, where am I going to put these things that I'm trying
to actually look at later?
And I was like, what about this?
What about Instapaper?
changed hands like a hundred times I feel like in the last five years. It's
quite nice. I put this article in there that I had mentioned
previously at the beginning of my 15-hour story and I started reading it
and I was doing some highlights / notes. I like the fact that you can do
highlights but you can do a highlight with a note also. I think that's very
important because I find them to be two very different things and I also don't
I just don't want a bunch of highlights with empty notes.
That's not helpful.
So, Instapaper, not sure if anyone has ever heard of it.
Brand new.
You've heard it here first.
Exclusive review of Instapaper.
It looked like it was changing hands a lot
and in the app store, I think the owner is InstantPaper,
I believe, which is kind of confusing.
I'm assuming they named the company
after they acquired Instapaper and called it Instant Paper,
maybe, I don't know the full background,
but that seems really weird to me
that you have the two distinctions there.
Anyway, I paid them 2.99.
I like ones that can read the articles in audio form,
like via whatever, Siri Voice or whatever it is.
I always like that about Pocket
'cause sometimes it's nice to just throw a couple articles
in the thing and just have it read to you
if you're in the car or just something I personally like,
I think a lot of people probably hate that.
- I wholly endorse your review
'cause I actually have a subscription to Instapaper.
I paid for it on an annual basis.
- And you still use it?
- I love it, still use it.
It's yeah, like Jason, I bought it
and I connected it to Readwise,
which is the service that sort of brings up your highlights.
So when you highlight in Instapaper,
It then resurfaces those for you to see later.
So you kind of, you can recall what you've read in the past.
So it's a way of rather than just being like a, a dumpster that you just read and
then throw things into the archive, never to be seen again, read wise connects into
it and then surfaces those highlights.
So it's good for study, I guess, but it's just good for bringing up
stuff you've read in the past.
That's one of the things I like about Instapaper is that there
isn't a specific notes category.
So you can just read through it, highlight stuff,
chuck it in archive when you're done with the article.
But then in notes, you still have all your stuff that was highlighted.
So you don't have to keep, if there's something you're trying to
remember from that specific article, you don't have to keep it around
until you're done with it and then go back and figure out where the
thing was you were looking for.
It's just all in a nice notes section.
So, and then I have, you can make little folders for different ones.
I mean, I, again, nothing revolutionary here.
I'm obviously not blowing anyone's mind with this, but if you're looking for that kind of thing, I mean, uh, here's my contribution
I have insta paper. I always forget to use it and I like reading things on the browser particularly with Safari reader
Okay, do you use reading list or do you just always read everything the second you find it and never?
Go back and find it later
Reading list is also a bucket of forgotten things that I will get back to in the future
So it's a mess in there and it's a mess in Instapaper
And yeah, I read things when I get to them and then I leave a tab open and then I think maybe I'll go back
to that and then
It starts to annoy me because I said that tab open in my browser and it's there for too long and I think do I read
It now no, I don't have time to read it now, but will I read it later?
No add to reading list forget never revisit. I another thing that I actually do find useful is the
quick hey this article takes, you know X minutes to read because
Often I will say I'm gonna go check out something that I want to read from the past and it'll be
I'll of course pick the article that's like the 50 million word
Think piece on you know
Why the red button on the window should close instead of minimize or whatever just with the instant paper as well
It's I always get sad when I it has like a really passive
Follow friends kind of feature to it. So if there's other people that are on
Instapaper and they heart a article it could show up in your friends feed
It's very very lightweight and it's not in your face at all
But I always get this heart because I occasionally I look in there and try and find new friends that are using
Instapaper and there's never any oh, you're gonna have a load now
Check out my instapaper instapaper.com slash
P slash
Look in the show notes brought to you by instant paper not to be confused with the instant gram. No, he uses that now
This is way more popular
Can we review Eric's desk
Yes, we should review Eric's desk. I'm excited to review Eric's desk and just to remind listeners of the past
We used to have we had a couple of HP minis in the past where we reviewed people's desk
And then we did a special edition on our blog
For Chris listen to Chris. So this is pretty much the first time we've done it as an embedded segment. I think yeah
But they're they're fun to do I encourage if you haven't listened to the desk reviews. Oh, that's high quality content
I mean who doesn't love a desk, you know, you you talk about home screens and stuff a lot but but like a desk
It's it's a real-life home screen. It's a screen in your home
It can be maybe it's not maybe you have no screens on your desk. That's what we're here to find
Well Eric's got screens. Oh boy. He's got screens
You know what else he has so I get a tea straight off and this has been bugging me for a while
I'm like, oh you're straight into it. He has screens. He also has keyboards
Yes, he does and it seems like he has he has a keyboard on his keyboard and this is got me baffled
Can I just remind sorry to butt in can I just remind our listeners that you can see this in the show notes the image
That we're talking about and it may also be the chapter artwork so follow along you can see what we're talking about
Anyway back to keyboards if you look carefully at his desk
He has a laptop perched on a couple of reams of what I would like to think would be a for paper
But it probably isn't it's probably what do you animals in America use like 11? It's probably eight and a half by 11
Yeah, you can't you if you fold an a4 piece of paper you get an a5 piece of paper
If you fold an a3 paper in half you get an a4 paper. It makes it's it's it's almost like the metric system for paper
You can do the same thing with outies I hear anyway anyway
That's beside the point on top of those reams of paper. He has a computer a laptop, but on top of the laptop
There's a keyboard
Now what why why do you need? What is the keyboard data keyboard I?
I assumed at first that the keyboard on top was for a Surface device, which I initially
thought was sitting right there, then decided, no, that's pretty much an iPad, I believe.
I think.
And maybe that's a Surface.
I think that actually might be a Surface.
I think that's a Microsoft Surface.
It's got a black pencil, doesn't it?
Yeah, that's a Surface.
That's the Surface keyboard.
Yeah, I think that's a surface and then he's using it as a tablet because it's so versatile
Compared to an iPad. Yes, right
And you just rip the keyboard off and it's you know
Now it's a it's an internet tablet and that's why that keyboard has like a Intel inside sticker or something on it
Correct. Incidentally, I bought it. I bought something an OEM thing
While ago, I can't remember what it was. I think it was maybe it was this mouse
I don't know. I can't remember but it actually came with one of those stickers as if you would actually put that sticker on your PC
Oh, oh, yeah
Really? I'm gonna do that as in you could peel it off and adhere it to something
Yeah, if you buy an Intel processor, they give you a sticker. Yeah, they totally give you that speaking of stickers
I want to focus for a second on
The fantastic range of stickers that Eric has chosen to put under his floating Samsung display
I'm noticing two Hemispheric Views stickers. We've also got your Coffee Pot games. We've got
micro.blog. We've got a few different options here and what appears to be some like nice
homemade... is that like a coaster or something? The pink thing with the sketch? I can't quite make it out zooming in but
we've got some nice sentimental things happening here.
I just want to say not only am I impressed and flattered that he's included our stuff
But a bit of an overall comment for this room. I like the fact that he's actually got the display levitating
I could never be bothered personally to do that, but it's a very busy area. He's got a lot of stuff
You would think that it's cluttered, but just by elevating the display
It's given the place room to breathe
visa mount
Visa. Yeah, that's it visa mount exactly and
Yeah, I just think it's quite cool that he's managed to fit in more stuff and yet still have it not clutter up his actual
desk. I'm pretty impressed by that. He needs one of your custom monitor over labels. Yes.
Which we discovered is actually something that other people do. I thought I was so innovative
putting a Dymo label over a Samsung logo and then all these people come out of the woodwork saying
"Ah yes, yes I've been doing this for years." Very impressed, very impressed. I've had that since I
was a kid, that Dymo label, and just as a brief aside I apparently, I recall asking for it because
because I remember Bart Simpson had one.
I think I saw it when I was like six or seven.
I was like, I need this mom.
And she went, yeah, I'll go and get it for you.
So yeah, Eric, maybe you should cover your Samsung logo
with a vintage Dymo label as well.
- Eric is the family-est family man, isn't he?
- Big time.
- It's impressive.
I really love it.
It's adorable.
It seems like he has a million members of his family.
I really appreciate that.
This cute dog.
He's got a photo in a photo, or is a photo of them holding a photo?
Which is kind of like it.
Oh, I think you're right. Maybe they're holding it.
Because I thought, why is he covering up one with the other?
Like, was that not satisfactory?
I think it's like a then and now photo.
Oh, they are holding it.
Oh, yeah, because it's like 2002.
And then 2006.
On their wedding day.
Oh, that makes more sense.
I wonder if that's when they first met.
They got married, but if they first met in 2002 with that photo, they're very that's a
Pretty intense first date. It's gonna say in that in that very comfy chair. Yeah
Huh? I love it. Okay, that makes more sense now. But yes, they're totally holding it
I see the hands on the edge another observation. I'm impressed that in pandemic times
He has pure all hand sanitizer at the ready on the left hand side
With what appears to be I would assume a hot beverage. I don't know what that is
I don't know where he's going with a thermos in his own house, but he's ready. I like to think it's soup
I like the idea of it being cold and him having a thermos of soup to do some work with during the day
Yeah, cuz I want an open bowl do you near multiple key no no, but I like him - I imagine him like a Roald Dahl
I remember reading it or seeing a video once of Roald Dahl the author and he would go to his little shed and put a
little blanket over him while he wrote his novels and
You know rolled I would have had some soup in a thermos and I like the idea of Eric doing the same thing
That's what he's doing in my head now. I was just gonna say that the fact that he has every single pair of
wireless earbuds that have ever been made
All at once on his desk and at first I questioned it, but then I realized the fact that
He's the runner guy that runs like 9,000 miles a day
Yeah, so he probably has them all because he has to like swap them out several times while he's running for like six hours
Straight. Yeah, they wouldn't say probably run
You know
he starts with the beats and then runs for a while then like swaps them out with the middle ones and
Then finishes with the air pods, you know, hopefully by that time he's actually
Done with his six-hour run, but I have to imagine that's why he has all of them
I can't think of any other reason why you'd have three sets of I'm assuming it's three sets
I don't know what the middle ones are the but the other two are pretty clear just to the left of that
I was very interested in this little wooden block. Mm-hmm, right that you can see next to the
Gentlemen climbing rock stairs carrying a log or something. I'm not sure at first
I thought it was like some communist missile thing, but I think it's a laborer. Anyway
Yeah, it's a log. I was thinking is that some sort of
Communist carrying a warhead on our way. It's just a guy carrying along anyway between the
Log man and the air pods that wouldn't block do we think that's some sort of dock or cradle?
You know where you can see that little divot ee. Yeah. Yeah
Or is that actually just part of the wood grain? What do we think we're looking at here?
I initially thought it was gonna be some kind of a wooden coasters inside of a little holder
Quickly dismiss that that is not what that is then I noticed if you look on the right hand side there appears to be an
angled
Channel in it. Yeah, which I believe is to hold the surface
Pro pad device thing at an angle
for
Doing the real kinds of work that you do with a surface
spread training
right
So what you're saying is that Eric is using this wooden block with the diagonally chiseled channel
To mount his surface of choice so that he can use the black pen that we don't know the name of to do spreadsheets
Slightly above the actual surface of his desk
Correct
Right. I think that's plausible. Yeah, I think that's got to be it what the little thing is in the front
I'm not fully sure because you like you wouldn't put your finger to like try it
I don't know what that's about
You know those things were like you'd put like your phone in a cup kind of thing and like it would make it louder
Mmm, maybe it's that I'm not sure but I think it's a surface hole. Is it a business card holder?
I mean maybe but at home
mmm
True. Well, he has a thermos for home. So why not?
I mean I get maybe like if if his wife or kids come over to the desk and they forget who he is
You can hand him a business card. I guess you could do that. Yeah, have you noticed as well Martin one for you?
I'm surprised you haven't picked up on this already the second book second book in from the the log man
60 meters to anywhere. I was gonna bring that up. Yes metric. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead
I know I think I know what you're gonna say the the fact that it's not spelled correctly. Yeah, there we go
60 meters
So close, but they got the metric system and then spelt it wrong
So nice try
And this is what I find this is what I find very interesting and I don't want to offend the entire United States here because
I know that you've got your whole
Webster thing and you wanted to spell it differently and make it make more sense
But color without a you is still color so you didn't really go far enough, you know
It doesn't really represent the sound but anyway back to meters. You're not using metric, right?
Which is fine use imperial do your thing?
But then when you decide to refer to it you spell it the way that you would spell the end of thermometer
So I'm actually reading 60 meters
to anywhere so does that mean that we're measuring the distance with
Thermometers you know what I mean? I'm just and then does that mean if you make a millimeter does that make it a millimeter?
If it's felt with an ER, how are we supposed to pronounce this?
Jason discuss I
It's perfectly fine the way it is. You say installment with one L. You say color with a use, color.
So I think it's just something we're gonna have to
agree
that
one way is correct and the other way is
optional. Well look, I mean we are relenting slowly. I mean gradually, and I don't know what Andrew has to say about this,
but focusing or focused, more and more we're spelling it with one S rather than the traditional double when using a past participle or a gerund.
You've got the what else do we have program? I mean
The Brits did switch to the French spelling when it was, you know
Fashionable in the 18th century with the double me and now we're going more back towards the M which is the American way
anyway spell meters, however you wish but
Yeah, I mean maybe you should adopt it. You're doing fine Eric. Don't listen to them. You know what that's that's an iPad
That's got to be an iPad on his desk. That's not an iPad. Look at it zoom in this it that's it
That's not bad pro with it. The corner looks glossy though
Which and the speaker cut out the iPad the iPads have a matte finish and I'm seeing a glossy reflection on the bottom right there
There are way too many
Antenna bands on the bottom of that to be an iPad
It you know why it looks like an iPad
Because they ripped it off because they would hope people would buy it because it looked like an iPad
Don't you both have the newest iPad Pro models that you can compare?
Yeah, that is not it. There is one antenna line not three
Does it have microphone grill cutouts and it has it has like a bunch of speaker holes not six
Okay, so it is made to give the illusion of being an iPad
But it is not
Therefore it is a surface up there
keyboard
Yeah, he's at work. He's doing work stuff. Everything's got to be Windows. It's all gotta be Windows II work stuff
He's not allowed to have fun at work. Can't be doing that. There's no fun here
Isn't this at home or are you saying he's working at home now? I'm confused. He's working at home
Yeah, I mean when he's at this desk, he's at work. This is the work desk because in my mind
I was just imagining he's just packed up everything. He's got the thermos. He's got his photo frames
He's going to work every day with this and laying it all out and then having to pack it up and take it home again
He could be doing that, but I think he's probably at home and that shows how long it takes because it's 1040
And he's only just logged in
Well, he's been running. He started running at 4 a.m
He had to run to work with all this stuff on his back. Like that's not easy
Long way long way to go and what's that blue thing in the in the corner on the right hockey puck?
Is it that seems pretty deep or tall?
Stressful, it's kind of thick for that. Yeah
some kind of exercise
thing to work out
knots
in your
Calf after you ran a long way
Unless it's like Vincent's ejector button. It actually presses in and you reveal something behind the wall. Maybe there's something behind this
Yeah, I think it's a secret wall. Yeah, that wood paneling is false wood. Yeah
There's it's like an escape hatch
Panic room and that appears to be some sort of air conditioner. Oh
Let me have a closer look at that thing. That's that's Andrews area of expertise
I'm thinking that's a space heater now. They're very inefficient. That's an inefficient space heater
Eric don't run that too much. They're not that great and they don't they use a lot of electricity. So that was that was Eric's desk
Eric, thank you for sharing that that's that's one of the benefits of being a
One prime plus member as you can have your desk reviewed send us a desk. We'll talk about it
fantastic
Yeah, like everybody talks about spam these days, but who's actually eaten spam in a can spam spam in a can
I have years ago. Oh like the food. Oh
never
only in
Hawaii that's the only place I can think where it would be
Readily available to be eaten. Otherwise, no, I don't think I've ever eaten it on
in
My home state is it naturally occurring in Hawaii or something? What's the deal? I don't know the full story, but somehow it is
Relevant to the food in Hawaii. I think maybe it's somehow related to
Native people of Hawaii would incorporate it into dishes. I think don't quote me on that. I don't know the full
History on it, but somehow I believe spam is
is
part of
Culturally, I think it's it's it's important to food somehow I believe again don't quote me on that but it's a thing
but not in the
Continental US I would say that's
I'm sure there's parts of the US where where that's a that's a thing. Obviously they sell it but personally
No, I've not eaten it really at all
Andrew any thoughts on spam? I haven't had it for years. I used to eat it quite a lot as a child
My mother would feed it to me
Fry it and then feed it to me as like slice it and fry it
But Spam's got nothing on corned beef corned beef is quite yummy for an occasional British taste
I could do a corned beef sandwich, but no spam not in a long time
That little key you had to use to open it was a reward pain, especially if it snapped
Is there a lot of spam in the gong?
Yeah, you can go to Coles or Woolies and see it on all the shelves and I just keep walking I'm not offended by it
What?
That was amazing.
