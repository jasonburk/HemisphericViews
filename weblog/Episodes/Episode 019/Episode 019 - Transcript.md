[Music]
I can't remember if it came up in our Discord or not, but somehow music came up and the
way that we listen to it or what we like to listen to.
So who added this and who wants to kick us off?
I think I did that when I was ranting about headphones and when I was bringing out different
headphones and different home pods and different things like that and how songs that I have
been listening to or have listened to for God, with however many 30 years now, how they
just sound different now and how much of that is either 30 years of time going by, of course
has something to do with it, where you are in your life has a lot to do with it, but
just the music quality and different sounds within music and how the songs are changing
when I'm hearing them on things like a HomePod or the AirPods, what are we calling these
again?
AirPods Max.
It's just, it was blowing my mind.
I was pulling up old songs just to kind of get an A/B test between AirPods Max, the AirPods
Pro, the in-ear ones, the ones I've had forever, the Bose QC35s.
I think I've had those for 10 plus years now.
And then I got another set just to kind of ABCD test them.
The ones that everybody says are just so great.
The Sony WH-1000XM4.
Just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?
Wow.
I mean, it's just like, I could say it six more times if that would help everyone go
to sleep.
Halfway there.
Yep.
So I've tried all four of those and just the difference in some of these songs that are
even super old from, I mean super old, you know, from the 90s and 80s and so forth.
I was just blown away at how different things are sounding in these new speakers,
especially with the HomePod. I had a HomePod, a HomePod Big, I'll call it,
and it was kind of like right next to me. And when the AirPods Max came out and they were
they were talking about this, like, you know, I, disclaimer,
I know, you know, I'm no audio pro, whatever.
I think audio is left up to whoever's listening to it.
You either like it or you don't, there's no,
I'm going to give you a review and these are going to be perfect for you.
It's just not the case. You can kind of do that with some technology. You know,
you may be able to say like this laptop is great for you because of X, Y, Z audio.
I don't believe that.
I think it's kind of bullshit that you can ever really review something and think
that it's gonna fit someone else.
It's just not possible.
Anyway, but they were talking about this like,
1% distortion at max volume or whatever.
And when I'm hearing that all in my head,
and maybe this is incorrect,
but I'm assuming that means when I'm at max volume,
only 1% of the audible range will or can distort.
Okay, that sounds cool.
Anyway, got a HomePod Big going.
It's cranked all the way up
And I am just, I am blasting myself out of the room
very irresponsibly.
Do not do that.
Please listen to everything at a reasonable volume.
- I was told that I could listen to the radio
at a reasonable volume.
- I've never done it.
I've been too scared to go above like 70%, I think.
- It's amazing.
Some of the, like some of the things
that were coming out of these songs were like,
where's, is this like a new version of this song?
Like, what is that instrument that I've never heard before?
Where is that coming from within this track?
It was amazing.
So that then when I got the headphones,
the new AirPods headphones, I was like, okay,
I'm gonna just like start picking tracks,
listen one, two, three, four, all the way through
and start figuring out, are these, you know,
are they worth it for me?
Again, are they worth it for someone else that's listening?
I don't know, go try them.
It's the best I can do for you.
You'll know if they're for you or not.
You know, if the price thing means they're not for you,
then they're not for you.
If the audio quality is not up to your, you know,
audiophile ears, then they're not for you.
Long story short, for me,
I just started really kind of thinking about music again,
where I haven't really thought about it seriously.
I don't know if I've ever been a serious,
diehard music person.
I get the impression Martin's very much
a diehard music person.
I don't know, Andrew, if you are or not.
I have not been able to gather that yet.
But for me, I've had a very, I don't know,
sorted history with music.
I've been very into it during certain periods of my life.
Certain artists have been like all consuming of my life
to then just whatever's playing on my iTunes playlist
in the background, whatever, I don't really care.
I also say, I'm the kind of person
that I can't really do work with music on.
If there's words, I can't, it just doesn't work for me.
I have to have like instrumental or just like, you know,
ambient kind of songs.
(upbeat music)
I don't really know where I wanna go from there with this
other than I feel inclined to just give you a quick
overview of these headphones, if you're interested.
- I'd love it.
And if I can butt in, I would also love to know
Andrew's opinion of the table that you constructed
to compare all of these headphones,
because I know that you do things like these documents
Jason, but I feel like CFO Andrew Kenyon, really this is his forte. This is his wheelhouse.
When you said table, I was thinking, did I miss a photo? Did Jason build a table?
Oh, he might have.
Did he do some woodworking? You're talking about a digital spreadsheet table.
Actually, both of those are true. You don't actually know which one you're going to get.
This one actually was a spreadsheet. It was a number of spreadsheet
with the four sets of headphones I mentioned. And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 points
to grade on with a very sophisticated algorithm rating scale ranging from at the top,
you have excellent, then you have good, then you have okay, then you have bad,
And then you have horrible. Okay. Cost. I'm not rating those because that's such a correct.
Yeah, it's different for everybody. You can't I don't, I don't know. I, it seems like the biggest
thing for these headphones currently has been like they cost so much and it's like, yeah,
things cost stuff. I mean, I don't know what to tell you about that. I don't know how you can
really rate something. You can rate it against the end product. I think if you can say this thing I
have feels crappy and shouldn't be this much, but to just straight up say like $5.50 is,
you know, one star, it's like, okay.
Look, I want to, can I just interrupt there?
I need to, I want to get just on the cost thing because I looked at them too and they're
like, well, that's probably too rich for my budget, right?
I don't want to spend that much on headphones because I don't use them enough to get the
money's worth out of them.
But you can't knock Apple for doing it because first of all, supply and demand, apparently
They've sold all of them, but the lead time on getting a new set of these is like miles out now
so you could take the argument they did they were too cheap because
Obviously people are willing to pay that money. So good on Apple. Well done market spoke, right?
Could have put the price up
Secondly, there's a concept and I'm gonna get economic theory here. There's a concept called a Veblen good
Showtitle and a Veblen good is something
a
Veblen good is something that actually in is
It's enhanced by its price
So it doesn't it's about it's about the way it's portrayed. It's a it's a showpiece item. So a
Ferrari or a Lamborghini may cost quarter of a million dollars. It may only actually be worth a
$50,000 let's say but by putting the price up you're actually increasing demand because it becomes a status symbol
That's a veblen good
I'm sure you can research that in Wikipedia and get a much more a much better definition than I've just given you off the top
Of my head, but nevertheless I see Apple as sometimes
Falling into this veblen good category and they that's what they go for and well done them. I agree
No one's gonna buy the all-new discount AirPods Max doesn't sound good. So tried them against the the Sony's which were
$280 AirPods Pro which are $250 and then the Bose that I already had which I don't remember how much they were when they were
New ten years ago somewhere around there
Yeah, yeah
Anyway, I think I'll just hit kind of highlights here of things that I found to be important for me noise cancellation
I think a lot of people say they have noise cancellation and they really don't.
The noise cancellation on these I rate as the absolute highest.
Excellent.
There is, this is the best noise cancellation I have ever used full stop.
Next in line would be the AirPods Pro.
That's it.
The Sony's I found it to be, I gave it an okay, which is basically the middle.
The analogy that I was telling my wife the other day is that the noise cancellation with
the AirPods, when you turn it on, all the other sound goes away.
The Sony's, it's more as though if you're talking to somebody, you just threw a blanket
over their head and it's, you can still kind of hear it.
It's just muffled.
It's not canceled.
It's muffled.
It should be called noise muffling.
And right on the box it says like, you know, industry leading world class.
No, I don't think so.
I found it to be passable at best.
I think the next thing after that would be the transparency mode, which I know
they all have their different words for that, but that's basically the mode
where you can hit a button or do whatever you need to do to be able to
hear the outside world through your headphones when they're on, right?
Again, these mind blowing you hit the button and it's as if you just took them
off, everything sounds as if there is nothing on your head any longer.
It's like, there's just two giant holes cut in the side of the headphones to
just let everything through. The Sony's I gave a bad I thought they were atrocious.
Again it just kind of sounded like you were sort of letting some sound through
and the only way to activate it on the Sony's is to literally hold your hand on
the earcup the whole time you want the transparency mode. I think unless I
missed something but as soon as you take your hand back off then it's back to
noise cancelling. Which to me, like the hand over your ear is like the opposite of go ahead and talk
to me, I can hear you. Right? You're being serious? I'm dead serious. That's the feature activation.
So when you go through like past customs through Judy Freemuse, there's really cheesy kind of
marketing shots of people like enjoying their music with their hand up to their ear. That's
what you actually have to do. You have to do that. You have to hold your hand on the ear cup to make
it go into like trans... I don't remember what they call it, but it's the basically
transparency mode.
Does that seem like a really cool DJ? You know how they sort of hold their hand up and
sort of mix?
That's what it is.
I mean, I kind of bring it. So that'll go to the next point then of how do you control
the headphones? The Sony's is all touch interface in the stupid ear cup. So you have no physical
Apple means like you're swiping up to do volume and like swiping forward and back to skip.
It's awful.
I don't know why anyone would want that.
The AirPods have two buttons on the top, one button to switch between transparency and
noise canceling or you can set it to be whatever too.
And then the little crown button for pause play and volume.
Buttons are great.
Of all the people that get rid of buttons,
I thought Apple would have gotten rid of buttons,
but I am so glad they didn't
because the touch controls on the Sonys are absolute garbage.
Build quality for $280 on the Sonys,
they felt like they were about $50.
Kind of just not great.
- I've been thinking about getting a pair of these Sonys
and you're really talking me out of it.
- Again, I would say get a pair of them,
try them out and then return them immediately like I did
because they're just, they're not good.
I really think they're not good.
But cutting to the chase, Jason, you would tell Andrew to enter a new line in his asset
depreciation spreadsheet for $899 Australian dollars.
Is that right?
Are they $899?
No.
In Australia, yes.
Oh my gosh.
Jason's just falling off his chair.
That's why we're a little bit apprehensive over here.
Okay.
Here's what I would tell you then.
You know what I would say?
I would say I still don't get the Sonys and get AirPods Pro.
That's what I would do.
I just, I really don't see why everybody's so gung-ho about these Sonys.
I don't think they sound that great.
Again, all personal opinion.
I think the usability of them sucks.
The build quality is kind of like, eh, whatever.
At 200, the same argument that people have for why are AirPods Max 550, I would say,
why are these Sonys 280 when they should be like 150 at the most.
I'd like to talk about AirPods Pro as well for a minute if we have the time.
Yeah, absolutely.
I'll hit two more things real quick.
Connected devices.
So how many things you can connect to the headphones.
There's just, if you're in the Apple world, there's nothing better than an AirPod because
of the way it can just connect to everything and switch and do all that.
I know some people have like hit or miss with that sometimes, but compared to the alternative
of the other ones where you have to pair
to specific Bluetooth devices and it can only pair to two.
If you want a third one, you have to like unpair
and pair to this one and no, that sucks.
I don't like that at all.
Charging port, it's lightning.
I don't know, it's fine.
I'd rather have USB-C, but you know,
all the AirPods are lightning, so fine.
That's one thing about the Sonys is it is USB-C,
so that was great.
Battery life, fantastic.
materials again, the AirPods materials are great.
I haven't found anything about them that it's like, why did they do that?
That seems weird.
Other than that, the ear cup can un-magnet and magnet back on upside down.
That is weird to me as like a product person.
I would have, that would have been like the first thing I did had been like,
guys, you need to somehow change the magnet so they can only go on the correct
way. It doesn't really affect it. I don't think, but maybe it does.
And then for podcasting, like right now,
they seem to work fine.
Controls, again, excellent on these.
Sonys are horrendous with that stupid touch thing
on the side.
(upbeat music)
And you had something to say about AirPods Pro,
which you have, and I remember you bought them
and you were not super jazzed about them.
Where are we at like three or four weeks later?
- Yeah, yes, the time's gone by.
I, let me preface by saying the AirPods original,
the first ones that came out,
I bought a pair of those and I loved them.
I still have them. The battery is
Trashed on them, you know, you get sort of half an hour if that
But they still are great and put them in my ear and I forget they're there
They just they just work. The Airpods Pro I was expecting to be the same thing
but just better, right? Noise cancelling all the cool stuff that they come with. I put them in and
They just don't fit my ears
Like I don't understand it
they totally, because they go in and sort of, they almost have to point, the
stalks sort of have a different angle on them, a different shape, so they fit in
my ear differently. And it must be me, I have wonky ears, because on one
ear it will always wiggle out and after wearing them for a few minutes I have to
like shove it back in again. And particularly if I'm talking, so if I'm
using, I couldn't use them for a podcast because I'm talking. If I try and use
them for a phone call. Same problem. Like, as my jaw moves in the talking, one of
them on one side just wiggles its way out and practically falls out every time.
So, for a few minutes I'm giving another shove back in my ear. And I never had
that problem with the original AirPods. You've tried all three of the tip sizes,
I'm guessing? Yeah, I've done all the tip things and tried different ones and I've
gotten the best of the bunch. I think I'm up to the small ones now, I don't know, I
I can't remember but and it's just annoying and so in it kind of undoes the noise cancellation as well
They kind of need to be shoved in a fair way for that to really take effect
So I'm constantly losing the noise cancellation because of my wonky ear and I'm gonna shove it back in
So I have found that I like them more when they're in transparency mode because they kind of then you don't notice
That it's not got that tight seal. But yeah on the whole I'm kind of disappointed with them and like obviously it's me
right, they're just not manufactured well for my ear shape because millions of other
people love them.
So I'm not blaming Apple, but it's just like, oh man, it's a bit of a bummer because the
first ones I loved so much.
I'm sad to hear that for you, Andrew, although I have my own AirPods Pro thoughts to give
where I do blame Apple, whereas you don't.
So I absolutely love mine.
I use them every day, particularly for podcasts.
I switch between the transparency and the noise cancellation modes all the time and
use the small tips. So prefacing this, I love them. However, I have recently had my third
replacement for them due to that rattling issue. Now, I don't know how many people have been
following this, but if you haven't, the idea is that when you put it in and you're using either
the transparency or the noise cancellation modes, right, so there's some audio augmentation
happening, you have this rattling noise like there is a ball bearing in your ear. If you toggle it
to off and nothing's happening. That's exactly it, nothing happens. You don't have any rattling noise
happening. So I have now had the third service where they have swapped at least one of the AirPods
Pro units and from what I remember being reported it was a firmware update and the problem was
resolved. However in my experience it actually appears to be a fault with at least some number
of the AirPods Pro earphones. So I don't think this is actually something that Apple has been
able to fix and it might be something in a future revision. Have either of you had any
of these issues before? Because as I said, I've had three services now.
I've been monitoring that because I read about it and I was like, I wonder if I have that?
And I don't think I do, but I keep...
You'll know when you do.
That's the thing. I was like, do I have it? Should I just take it in just in case? But
clearly you're telling me that if I get it, I'll know.
Yeah. The way that you tell that it is actually an issue with the way that it's working and
not something just moving in and out of your ear like the jaw thing you said is if you toggle it to off and
Nothing rattling is happening in the audio or whatever. You know that it's the noise cancellation or transparency mode
So I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying them
It's funny actually that I seem to have had more faults than you Andrew, but I absolutely love them
So I'm willing to look past it and thank Apple for its very generous
repair or extension program
Because they are a great device. I had the rattle thing once with my first pair
And they replaced it and I didn't have the rattle thing after that. I have had several of the ear tip thingies
break and
They've replaced them both once they sent me a whole friggin ear pod
Ear pod that I set your pod air pod to replace just the little like, you know
point zero zero one cent
Rubber tip they sent me a whole air pod and they didn't want the other one back and I was like, okay
So I literally have like three years now, which is weird
But no, I had the rattle thing once that got fixed. Two of the little rubbery things have broken off
The ear thing it doesn't happen when I'm talking so much
But if I try to eat I think just maybe like wider mouth for me
It's like maybe the tipping point's different, but if I try to eat with them in
Oftentimes I'll end up with an issue with I'll have an air pod in my food for sure
Like that's happened so many times now that I don't even care to count. So that's definitely an issue
I would say and I don't remember if that ever happened with the first ones or not. I think the way that the first ones
Canically interacted with your ears and the fact that the little sticks were much longer
I think that kind of seeded them more securely than the new ones
Maybe being small like shorter. I don't know. I'm not sure on that
But I don't remember the other ones falling out and let the only issue with the first ones
I ever had is if the little long stick thing got somehow like caught on a jacket or something
then it would pop pop out and fly, you know, a mile down the street.
You'd have to go find it.
But the I don't think the ear thing is necessarily you.
I think it's one of those where you're designing a thing to fit a human body part that is literally
infinitely different.
And I mean, I'm not trying to like, you know, Apple didn't do anything wrong.
I think it's just part of naked stuff that interacts with people.
So talking, I think shifting to the other part of what Jason started talking about,
you know people have different ears both physically but also have a different ear for things.
Jason, you're a serious headphone person as we can see.
Andrew, you're considering it.
Music listening habits and the kind of music you listen to.
How do you two prefer to listen to music and what are the songs that you would put on straight
away like the classics or the things that you gravitate towards?
Andrew, do you want to start this time or?
You start Martin, you're constantly, you tell us, you set the table.
I don't mind headphones.
Like I said, I use the AirPods Pro every day, but that's mostly for podcasts, some music.
To me, if I'm listening to music, I really much prefer the feeling of having it in an
open room with speakers, right?
So currently, as I've said before, that's the HomePods as a stereo pair in the lounge
room with the Apple TV as well.
And I've got the iPod Hi-Fi in the bedroom for occasional use or like airplay to around
the house if we're doing housework or something.
But for me, that open air stereo speaker style setup is far preferable.
And that just comes from childhood habits.
You know, growing up with my family, we always had music playing through two stereo speakers.
amplifier thing we had this fantastic for the time six stacker CD player and
we were just constantly doing things in random not shuffle this is pre shuffle
we're talking random so I was growing up with things like you know Van Halen
Def Leppard no doubt lots of different things you know you've got Cat Stevens
all of these different things I remember there was a lot of there was some ABBA
thrown in there as well so I grew up with a lot of different stuff but in
terms of coming into my own with my own musical taste as any classic Apple fan
should do you know there's a bit of Coldplay in there you have to like some
non-offensive British rock but a lot of other Australian bands and things too so
when I think about the way that I like to consume music it's a very eclectic
collection and I really went all in I think Jason made a joke about me and I
maybe even knew Andrew on a previous episode about ID3 tags and metadata I
I was so just super into the whole managing your metadata in an iTunes library when that came along.
And in more recent years, even though I'm a big Apple Music fan in terms of its convenience and integration in the system,
I kind of feel this sense of dread or longing for what was before.
I recently did a big clean out of my own music library on my iPhone and Mac and everything,
because I found that over the years since adopting Apple Music,
Crap has been infesting my library because of the convenience of being able to add songs to it and one day recent
Are you talking about that you to album of?
That I purged but actually it's funny you bring that up because I found the the PDF was still in the iTunes library
You know that little booklet the digital booklet. I
Thought it was totally gone, but the digital booklet was still there, but yeah, it'll come back doesn't matter
You can delete that all you like it's coming back. It should have been called songs of persistence
That's it.
But yeah, I'm all in on music streaming.
I think it's great.
I think it's better if you download it.
Also kind of from an environmental perspective, because music streaming and video streaming
are taking up more energy every year.
So if you can download rather than stream, it is better for your own energy consumption
in the environment.
Slight tangent there.
But I feel like if we can be deliberate in our music listening and have a collection
of songs that we really love. I've tried to iTunesify my Apple Music experience and only
add the things that are really important to me to keep things focused. And then use Apple
Music like the other panes and other views as more of an exploration device, if that
makes sense. I wish I wish music was more like photos where, you know, in photos where
you can say either download all originals or optimize or whatever the hell it's called.
I wish music did that because I would love to just have, because right now I have my
my photos library on an external, you know, gigantosaur drive.
So everything can just be local.
I would love to do that for the music too and just say download everything.
And I get that.
I'm not, I should clarify.
I'm not trying to say download all of Apple music.
I don't want that.
It's like, I just want, you know, back when we did iTunes match and all that stuff, which
Which honestly, I kind of feel like I would love to somehow just download everything that
exists, blow it all away, and almost start over.
Because I don't honestly know what my library even is anymore in terms of what was iTunes
match, what is stuff that I had ripped and put in there versus what is streaming versus
who knows what else is out there.
Or the other problem of maybe the version I ripped in 1992 at 96K because I had a 2MB
hard drive or whatever.
Now it's like, well, the streaming one's 256.
What the hell one is even playing?
I don't know.
Is it the one that I have?
Is it the one you have?
I have no idea.
There's no little indicator for that.
And that was a selling feature.
I don't know if you two remember from the Apple Music keynote, which was very awkward.
said "Oh, the streaming music lives alongside your iTunes music" and I felt a slight sense
of uneasiness when I heard that because I went "That does sound very convenient".
It removed that issue of "Oh, I want to listen to my iTunes library but I am also a Spotify
subscriber so you have these two separate worlds" but I instantly felt this sense of
uneasiness about "Is that going to be messy?" and it seems like you're saying that it has
become that.
Yeah, I'm almost, not afraid, afraid is the wrong word, but maybe intimidated
to even try to go in and parse, like, I really want a playlist of, you know, music I used to
listen to in this year or that year or whatever, but it's almost like there's so much crap in there
now. I almost don't want to even go and look at it because it's just kind of overwhelming now.
And I don't know how to edit any of the songs. And then they did that when you did the music
iTunes match thing. And it was like, Hey, if you happen to have some really low quality
crap versions, aka you stole them on Napster, go ahead and upload them and we'll give you like the
good versions. It's like kind of a, we're going to wipe the slate clean, we're going to forget
about all your piracy, and you're going to be a good consumer from now on, right? And it's like,
yeah, of course I am. Yep, you got it. So I just, I don't know what's what anymore. And I find it
hard to find things in here. And I keep reverting back to the tab that's called recently added,
Which sucks because it only goes back like, I don't know how far, but it's not very far.
So, eventually things roll off of that and now, who knows where they are. I don't know how to
find them again, especially with new music where if I do actually discover something on Apple Music,
which is honestly not that often, but I'll find something I like and I'm like, "Oh, cool,
add and then they'll be going to recently added but after you know 15 or so of those they roll
off and it's like well that'll never be seen again. Well in terms of navigating music I really
enjoy the song list showing artwork on the side like organizing by album with the column browser
up the top and I personally found it very easy, not very easy but much easier on the Mac to purge
things and sort through like what you're saying by adding you know you've got the show view options
You can add a column that says the iCloud status or how it fits within Apple music
So you see things like matched or uploaded or removed or ineligible?
So that did make it much easier and I remove something like 1500 songs
that's
Maybe that's extreme. But yeah, what about you Andrew? Yeah. Well in terms of music
I like Jason was saying he doesn't quite know what type of person I am. I'm not a huge music guy to be honest
I'll listen to it. I like you like you were saying Martin
I prefer to have it on in a room around me so I can wander around but not be dedicated to listening
It's more creating an atmosphere probably if you if you had to
Push me in terms of what is my favorite band and I don't really have a favorite band
But it would probably be something like Radiohead or something from the sort of that
90s era all slightly alternative but still a little bit mainstream good choice
And that's probably where I would sit in the the mix of like what do you like?
But I really like country music as well.
I think that's quite fun to listen to.
I've really been smashing Taylor Swift's new albums.
So that's...
I don't care anymore, right?
I've got no strict credibility to gain or lose.
I don't know if that's cool or not.
It's just what I enjoy listening to.
What I do know about my musical interests, and it's good that I mentioned Taylor Swift
Generally, I gravitate to male singers.
If I look through my list of songs that I like, it's usually a male vocalist.
I have no idea why, it's just a thing.
I don't do it by choice, it just happens.
So clearly, I like male singers more than female, generally.
The Apple TV+ series Becoming You, I don't know if you've heard of that, it's about the
first five years of life for all kids on the planet.
It's great.
Natasha and I are watching it, it's really good.
is actually part of I think maybe the first or second episode where they talk about how
very very quickly upon entering preschool and primary school both sexes immediately
start to gravitate towards their own even without intervention. So I wouldn't be surprised if,
because when I think about formative years I wasn't being blasted with male-only music but
you just start to seek out things that sound familiar or are on your side of things. So
I wouldn't even necessarily say that's your fault or that you're being sexist that's just
Something that happens. No, it's just an interesting observation. Um, so yeah, I'm not a huge musicologist by any means
So I like I like all sorts of stuff stuff. I really don't like is like heavy metal really hardcore
If there's lots of guitar riffs, I'm not into that
That's not my my scene at all unless it's part of a WWE wrestling intro in which case I'm totally okay with it
I hear a bit of Stone Cold Steve Austin glass shattering. I'm all over that but that's the only context
I want heavy metal kind of sounds just on Apple music though. Yeah, same thing
So I'm I'm all in with the Apple music, but I don't love the interface and I've just gone to an area in my library
I don't think I've ever even looked at this and I've clicked on songs and then sorted by play
And there's a whole bunch of stuff that's gunk that's like putting the kids to sleep, you know lullaby music
Which is dominating my playlist now, but then I've got a bunch of other songs and they've got little exclamation marks next to them
I was like, what what is that? And it's all stuff that I had
pre
Apple music right and if I double click the little exclamation mark
It says the song but cannot be found because the original file could not be found. Would you like to locate it?
Well, no, because I don't know where it is, isn't it? Oh now it's playing in my ears
So it found it but I said cancel that's exactly the experience
I had things that said that they were removed or missing are actually in there. So this is a layer of complexity
That has been added by the streaming service things that you've always had. They're still there. Yeah, but it thinks it's not
So I don't know where any of my stuff is
I've got a huge, like, I've got a big storage drive that's actually turned off to turn the
fans off for this podcast, but it's got a, like, my entire music collection from circa
Napster to, like, 2011 or whenever I stopped doing that.
And that's like a time capsule of music that I had.
And that was when I used to do, like, smart playlists with iTunes and all that, and the
ID3 matching so you could pick out like give me a rotation of songs from
1998 that I really like you know my best one that haven't been played in three months and all that kind of cool smart
Let's play this stuff and all that's just gone by the wayside now
But I keep that as like a little archive of music that I know I actually have even though I don't really use it
It's just kind of like there isn't a you know
Emergency in case of emergency turn on the hard drive, and you've still got something well the point about data loss
I think is very very important and this is something that again would never have happened in the iTunes era unless you stupidly deleted something
You buy a song on iTunes in the past you own it. It's on your device, right?
It's synchronized or backed up on something in the Apple Music and Spotify era
Someone decides to remove it from the archive. It's gone. So a good example of that
I don't know if both of you are familiar with the Cat Empire the Australian sort of ska funk band
Well, the lead singer Felix Riebel has this fantastic spin-off song in his own little solo career called Marina. We love it
Fortunately, I bought it because now if you search for it, it's purged. It doesn't exist
So sometimes these music management decisions or licensing things are performed and then you lose it
So, you know, it's good that you still have your files
But in an era of streaming where you're actually just paying for access to someone else's storage
Imagine having albums worth or even just a couple of songs here and there that you love and listen to every day
And then for some business or creative decision, they're removed and you can't get them anymore
So I feel like this is a major disadvantage of the current very convenient setup that we all have
What's like the video stuff or like every month? There's an article that says, you know, oh, here's what's leaving
Hulu this month and it's like
Okay, great. And that's why we have to have every damn service because you never know which one it's gonna be on. That's right
It's really hard to fall in love with music now in the same way that you'd listen to an album
Over and over again and get to know the whole album now
I'm sounding like an old man now, but even a favorite track you might find in this
Apple music sort of world like Jason was saying you add it to your music
But then it bubbles down and suddenly it's gone. You're like, how do I find that song that I liked again?
You can ask Siri, "Hey Siri, play the..." You know, it's like, just...
Maybe you can ask them. Sorry.
Siri just...
Finally, we finally got that to happen on the episode.
You know what...
That's the song he was looking for. It knew.
What?
Oh, wow. Do you know Siri is just playing...
It's playing "The Dollar" by Jay Dilla and "Rough Draft".
That's apparently what I was looking for.
You want something in your library.
Does not.
Copyright strike.
No, of course.
I didn't even know who that is explicit as well.
Oh, wow.
Amazing.
So yeah, I can't find music anymore.
I think so much of music has to do with the time in your life too.
That.
I mean, it's like asking what's your favorite band.
It's it's what's your favorite color.
What's your favorite?
Anything.
I don't know.
Ask me, you know, a hundred times a day, you're probably going to get at least 37
different answers.
I don't know.
So I think so much of it has to do with, with the time in your life and what was
happening and what you basically tie that little red, red, crazy string from
that part of your life to that song, album, whatever, and like there's songs
that I listened to today, you know, arguably maybe I don't really think
they're that great now, but it's about, it's almost like a time machine.
It takes you right back to where you like were in your headspace back then for that.
Likewise, there's music that I was life obsessed with from years past that I, I
absolutely cannot listen to now.
I don't know what the word like triggering or whatever the proper
terminology is for it, but it's like, those were not good times, but that music
was fitting for that time, but not now.
So there's like, there's stuff I have in my library that I'll go buy and it'll be
like, don't listen to that.
That's not going to put you in a good space right now.
So it's very interesting how, what an effect that has.
Yeah.
Music's one of those things where I'll sometimes hear a song and I'll be like,
Oh, I know, I know that the last time I heard this or the time I is when I was
driving on that road and I was just turning right at that intersection and you can just
remember everything about what you were doing at the time that you heard a
particular song.
It just, it can take you to a time and a place like no other media can.
But yeah, it can also be if it's a bad association,
like, "Oh, that's that terrible girlfriend I had, huh?"
Yeah.
- Yeah, and you do associate certain music
with certain people.
Like I can tell you the backing track
to pretty much every family road trip that we had,
'cause we used to go for like family snow trips and stuff.
It was just electric light orchestra for ages.
I love that stuff.
So yes, I didn't live in the '70s,
but I'm there for a good chunk of the time.
But yeah, so I don't know.
I think you're right, music's a time machine.
Funnily enough, I even did an episode of that
with a friend on the rumination thing,
but that's a separate story.
It transports you to different places,
it connects you to different people,
but I don't wanna sound like an old man either,
but I think today for all of the convenience that we have,
we have surrendered a bit of control.
So I think we are in a better place
in terms of variety and cost efficiency,
but I do think we've kind of lost something.
And actually, this is something that I heard,
and I don't know if either of you are familiar with it,
But have you heard that TikTok apparently is having such an effect on how music is made
that they're actually starting to reduce or even cut out instrumental intros in songs
in popular music?
Because lyrically, you know, you need to have words coming up to match whatever dances or
advertisements are happening.
So you're actually seeing songs that just start almost with choruses.
Wow.
I saw that on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation free-to-air television. So you know that I'm a young man. Yes
Okay pop quiz what is your what's the first
Artist in your are all artists list. The first one in my library is
Aha's take on me. Ah, ah
Classic great song mine is talk about taking it back to a time and a place mines a guy called Aaron Myers
And he's a guy we saw in when we're yeah when we're a holiday in Washington DC
This is like a recurring thing now every single story is like well, let me take you back to the time that
Yeah, we went into like a little lounge bar kind of place and then we had some drinks and then we went downstairs
And this indie guy Aaron Myers was singing you sort of like a jazz guy
And it was just a small bar and we felt quintessentially like we were living the ultimate like classy
American TV show lifestyle because we were like going to the bar. We were drinking a few martinis
We've gone downstairs having a cocktail listening to the jazz guy
play to a small crowd with the tinkle of glasses and the
Murmuring of the crowd and he was all very smooth and we were totally smashed by the end of the night
But we bought his album and that's how it ended up in on CD. We got photos with him. We were like we're from Australia. Yeah
Yeah, so Aaron Myers Leo rising
Great memories. That's great. I don't think I have a travel story
The first thing in my list is moon safari by air. No one's ever heard of it
Someone's heard of it Oh
Yes, they had that they had that big hit
Sort of almost Top Gun era wasn't it?
That was a big song.
Did they just name themselves that way so they would become alphabetically first before Air Supply?
Is that the idea?
They were looking to the future that said someday there's gonna be an electronic means
and people are gonna need to sort and on podcasts they're gonna ask
what is the first thing in your playlist and we need to be number one.
So we're going with Air.
And I bet you they foresaw like a gigantic vinyl record Rolodex.
We'll call it cover play. Is there any way to know how many songs you have?
That's if you go to the song list on the bottom status bar it should show you the stats unless
it's hidden. Oh what do you got? This is no way correct. 2,472. How many how many days is that?
6.7. Okay. I have 4,137 items at 12.4 days. Wow I need to get rid of some crap. 8,736.
144 songs 27 days Wow I always thought it was funny they put the time in there like
If you're ever in a situation where you need to have something playing for a month straight
You're covered. It's like oh, thank goodness
If it were 26 days, I'd be really screwed
That's not even a full a full time on survivor. All right, it's nothing. Here's a question. What is your
Guilty pleasure song in your library and it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be horrible
But it's just something that if people heard it they went wow, this is not necessarily what I expected from you
Hey, do you say song or artist? Oh either way, I mean it could be a song could be an album
It might not even be necessarily embarrassing but people go. Oh, that's okay. That's a bit odd
God, I'm not finding anything. That's like
that I would be
Where is the power really?
- Well, while you're looking, I'll give you two examples.
- Oh, he's already got it.
He's like, they're also my most played songs.
- Fairly often, actually, you're right.
One of them is a fairly regular song,
like the, I mean, but I really love it.
I feel like, when is it from?
It's from 1998, so it's not anywhere near new,
but it's the song, "If You Could Read My Mind"
by Amber Ultranate and Jocelyn Enriquez.
Have you ever heard that?
- Never. - No.
It's like this, all that I can explain is it's like,
it's like 1990s pop meets collaborative remixed disco.
I don't know, it's like a pop disco tune from the 1990s
with these three great female vocalists.
And I love the song and I just put it on.
And I think at one stage, Natasha said,
"This has come on a few too many times in the car."
And I went, "Okay, this is rich, guilty pleasure status."
- I wish we could play music on the show
without being arrested.
my old yeah yeah well I mean we I mean I suppose we could link that that's okay
but the ultimate guilty pleasure song I have to say is Falco's rock me Amadeus I
think that's fair I love that song we're talking from from the movie Amadeus
we've got the late Falco singing this bizarre like new wave German pop synth
song about Amadeus Mozart which is in half English half German it's it's very
odd but that's that's the ultimate guilty pleasure tune for me.
Alright mine is probably a country artist called Billy Currington and the song is "Must
Be Doing Something Right" I think or maybe "Good Directions" either of those is pretty
good.
Maybe "Good Directions" "Good Directions" is a bit more uplifting.
It's about him seeing a pretty girl on the side of the road and then she drives off but
Ultimately she gets turned around and she comes back to medium and they assumedly get together. It's a great song
Good directions. Is there a banjo?
They could be
But um
That's probably a guilty pleasure I've I've gone into my Plex library and this is way more representative of like
Me so you have music in in Plex use use it for music - I have it all indexed
I never actually really play from it, but it's all there and it's all indexed
everything that I had on my, on my NAS.
And it's yeah, it's very different sort of collection than what showed up in
Apple music. That's for sure.
I'm trying really hard to find something that's like embarrassing and I'm not
finding what, like, I know there's, I know there's horrible garbage in here.
You know what it is? It's just you experience no guilt.
No, no. I'm sure they're like, that's the funniest part is I could probably just
hit, put it on random and hit play and be like, Oh no, that one's terrible.
Don't listen to that.
But like all these seem fine.
All right.
I'm going to ask a very direct question.
Jason is the song Macarena in your library?
No, it's not.
Okay.
Steps five, six, seven, eight.
I have, I have, um, a group, the song is good, so it's not really, I'm not
embarrassed about it, but I think people would look at it weird.
It's called Lothar and the Hand People.
(laughing)
- Wow.
Wow.
- It's a weird one.
Like it would make you go like,
are you like fine?
Or do you need help?
Like, is this a signal for help?
I'm not sure.
So that could be one.
- I think that the name is enough.
I think you fulfilled the brief there.
(laughing)
- It's maybe the weirdest name.
Yeah.
- Looking at the time,
I think we should very quickly touch
on the other things there.
We've already done headphones, Andrew, did that fulfill what you wanted?
Yes, I've complained about AirPods Pro, so I'm happy.
And I've been talked off the ledge from buying those Sony's.
So now I don't know. I've got an old Bose.
What am I using? The old Bose QC 15 or something?
Yeah, the ancient.
I need an upgrade, but I'm stymied as to what I need to upgrade to.
I will say, OK, for the Sony's, I would say.
Try them.
I mean, you can always, I'm sure you have stores that are open in your COVID free
country that you can return them to, but I don't know.
I'm just shocked at what rave reviews they get seemingly across the spectrum
of all that is the internet.
And I just, I don't understand.
Yeah.
Maybe I'll just keep on working with these boys.
They work.
Yeah.
My QC 35s.
I mean, they're 10 plus years old and I replaced the ear cups once because they were kind of getting like that
How that weird like fake leathery stuff gets kind of but flaky
Yeah, the flaky like weird and you're like, why is there weird flakes all over me? Yeah, other than that, they've been fine
I've done that three times. Yeah, I had that in the office and I had fragments in my ear like it looked like
It was bad. I get to the like the the toilet look in the mirror and go
Oh, it looks like I've been seasoning my ears with something. It's ridiculous
Yeah, you have like weird little like pieces of nori like coming out of your hair or something
Black, black dandruff
That's not how you eat food
Come on
(laughing)
[MUSIC PLAYING]
