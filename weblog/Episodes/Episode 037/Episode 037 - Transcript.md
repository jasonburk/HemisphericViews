Music.
We're doing things a bit different this time around traditionally we've recorded on a Tuesday night my time Tuesday night.
Yeah, Tuesday night for you both Tuesday
Morn wait, no
Tuesday morning for me Tuesday night for you
So it actually was the same day and then Martin would roll over when we hit midnight
And I'll tell you what every time we've ever done it
I've actually had a mild moment of should I troll them and name the file the date that I actually finished
For anybody that can hear that Martin has a new soundboard
He's got a little soundboard that's got birds and buses and toilet sounds all your favorite
Gong sounds all on there. So so yeah, so it's usually a Tuesday. It's usually quiet where Martin is because it's midnight. So
Martin now today is a Sunday. We've changed all up not just the time but the day we're recording on Sunday at least Sunday for me
Martin Sunday for you too, but clearly Wollongong the bird life is alive and well
The town is buzzing
What time is it? So we've started around 1 p.m.
My time and because I live in the suburbs of Wollongong more specifically like
In more like in the foothills of our escarpment under Mount Kira
You've just got these hills with buses and hoons with motorbikes going up as you might have heard
Birds are like going crazy. There are you know cars going down the road
it's just like wildlife bedlam. I love living here but it's much much quieter when we normally record
so I hope the listeners enjoy it. We need to know what time it is for Jason because he's been the
one suffering at 5am waking up for a 5am recording at our traditional time so Jason have we done you
a solid now or is it still terrible? Yes and no everything is good now we are at a solid 8pm
on a Saturday. It's kind of perfect. I don't know why we went an entire year
before we figured out that weekends existed, but we have now discovered that fact and here we are.
I want to give a huge Patreon thank you shout out to David H. Thank you, David. You are a global
supporter wait no he was a hemispheric supporter and then upped it to global
that is dedication so especially considering he initially supported the
north and so what I like to think is that Martin and I were engaging and
wonderful enough that he realized that no that the cash shouldn't be going to
Jason it should be going to the global group I think I tell you guys a secret
Fantastic. So when he subscribed to the North that made us even so regard like
taking out the global ones right and the crazy people that do the above and beyond
account that made us even between South and North and I was pretty happy about
that. Then I was conflicted because he upped it to global which gave me minus
1 on the north back to 0. So I had a dilemma. Do we, or should I say, should I allow the
account to remain at global or do I secretly downgrade him back to north to make it even?
It's less money but then I'm back in the running. So I'm a little conflicted but either way,
thank you David. I think the difference really comes, I mean
the decision comes down to are you making him pay less for the same benefits? Because
then it's you know it's a great victory for him and a victory for you but I'm
not sure how others would feel. What I appreciate with David is not only is he
supporting us but he's he's he's bought into the discord community as well he's
been chatting away there with us not just by himself there's been others
there too. Everyone's great there yeah great dedication. So it's it's it's a fun place to be.
I forgot I had that app and I realized it today and thought this is the
perfect opportunity for that. Which app is it? Thwip. Very useful, especially if
you're in any kind of working environment where you're in like pretty
serious meetings with people and you know if they are a little boring or if
it's you know something really profound. So I'm the Muppet who spent $50 on
Farago. Clearly didn't need to do that. If you want to join in the discord too,
we'd love to have you. David's been great. All the current listeners have been there for a while,
really enjoyed the dedication and maybe a little bit more enticing for some of our listeners if
you happen to be into gaming. I'm not. But Jason, I think you recently came up with the idea to have
a separate gaming channel. So we've now got a few more avenues for discussion, different things to
explore. So if you're not into certain categories or you want to lean more into the media corner
thing or the games or when we have live events and stuff following Apple keynotes, the Discord's a
really lovely place to engage with other listeners and chat to us. Yeah, yeah, it's evolving nicely.
I really like what's going on there. And the reasoning behind adding more, we used to only
have, I think, two channels initially. We just had the private and the public. But as more and more
people come on and more and more things are being talked about, we think anyway, it makes sense to
have more channels so that exactly that if you don't give a crap about gaming
you can just mute that channel and never hear from it yet get all the
information from the ones you do care about exactly because I've loved seeing
some of the things that have popped up in the gaming channel and have read it
and then I went wow that's really interesting I have nothing to add I'll
come back later Martin's mr. default that's kind of what he's been tagged
with you know regardless of what he uses he doesn't use all default stuff but he
She uses a lot of default stuff.
I was using some default applications myself.
And something's driving me a little bit bananas.
And I'm just curious what you guys think about this.
So look at something like Reminders,
where you can now put little SF symbols--
I think that's what they're called--
as the little category pictures and all that.
And that's kind of coming around to different areas
of the system.
Here's my question.
When I look in SF Symbols,
there are 3,164 distinct symbols
that you can use from that collection.
That's great, that sounds fantastic.
Why is it almost every app that uses the damn things
gives you like six?
Why can't I just pick all of them?
Anybody have any idea?
Is this a, we know better than you or what?
I'm just very confused why there seems to be so many great little symbols and no
one takes advantage of that.
Now, just to clarify for people listening and also maybe just for me,
because I'm aware of SF symbols, but F set, sorry,
SF symbols are more something that is, is a more developer focused.
My understanding is that it's, it's, yeah,
it's a library of symbols that developers can,
can use within their stuff so that I think it's, it's, it's a means of, Hey,
you don't have to create all your own assets for everything.
Here's like a bunch of little pictorials for basic, you know, all your stuff.
You can just use these.
There are so many of them.
And yet every time somebody implements them, it's like 12 of them.
Is there something in the Hig or the, uh, that says you, so many are
reserved for interface elements? Maybe that could be. Because the first thing
I'm thinking of if you're talking about default apps or what Apple does it
reminds me even though it's not SF symbols I think immediately about the
reactions in iMessage. Now there are more possible reactions in human life or
emotions than an exclamation mark and a question mark and a ha ha and a thumbs
up and all of that right? But what Andrew just said I think lines up with it
pretty well that it's probably something,
I don't know if it's in the human interface guidelines
or maybe just this general philosophy
that let's not clutter it up,
let's only give these options
because that's all that people will generally need.
And then the nerdier ones of us look at it and go,
look at the communicative possibilities of these symbols,
why aren't they using it?
Whereas most people just go,
oh, I'll chuck this in, that's handy to have.
And then maybe down the line when enough of us complain
or say, you're not using it to its potential,
it's rolled out as some enhancement
feature down the line.
I'm just going to hit you guys with a bit of pseudoscience actually.
I'm wondering whether it's something to do with the tyranny of choice.
Have you ever come across the jam experiment where people were offered the opportunity
to buy from a myriad of jam flavors as opposed to another group being presented with something
like seven jam flavors or something like that.
And it turned out that they sold more jam with the seven flavors as opposed to, "Here
are all the flavors in the world of jam that you could possibly have."
Because the choice overwhelms people and you end up just walking away from it.
It's too hard.
Too hard.
Too many...
I'm overwhelmed with decision.
The paradox of choice.
I agree with that.
But in the sense of something like a list where you're setting up different lists with
Symbols if the default symbol is just like a little list three lines thing and you never want to change it fine
But if I want to make a list that's for
XYZ like why would you not let me just pick all of them?
I don't know. It just seems like you went to all the trouble of making all these symbols
Let me use them. It's like streaming services
I cut down on the streaming services that we had to the ones that we actually used so to rise
There you go, so I got rid of Stan which is in Australia
They actually have arguably a much better movie selection than at least what Netflix does in Australia
You could squabble over the TV selection, but got rid of that
I've been happier because it's like oh
Here's the actual selection of paid stuff and the free-to-wear apps that we have but then talking about the myriad
Opportunities to watch stuff. I then thought oh
Stan had all of the 007 films now
I don't have access to all the double-oh-seven films, and then I thought oh god
Do I need to do I need to sign up for that again?
And then I went you know what Martin the whole time that you had Stan you never watched one double-oh-seven film
You should be comfortable with that decision, so I'm not saying it's entirely analogous to what you're saying Jason
But I kind of get what Andrew is saying that whether it's a human interface thing or choice
You know what maybe too many SF symbols would drive you crazy, okay, so it's a decision by the foot. I got it. Thanks
Office 365.
It's now Microsoft 365 Jason.
You're not up to date with the branding.
Oh really?
I had no idea.
Yeah, yeah.
I honestly didn't know that.
It really is now.
Yeah, it's not Office 365 now.
It's Microsoft 365.
Well, back in my day, it was called Office 365 and it had all of your 365 needs covered.
I don't really have much to say about it.
I've just been using it because I have to and it's actually pretty fine.
I'm shockingly surprised how well it works with other stuff.
I've been using it with fantastic Cal and Apple mail works totally fine.
Very surprised.
There was a day when trying to use Apple mail and an alternative calendar with
anything outlook Microsoft related was an absolute nightmare.
now it's 100% fine. I mean, even down to the calendar,
selecting the calendar,
letting you select calendar categories within the calendar is
shockingly fine.
I'm not going to say it's great because it's calendar and mail, like whatever,
but yeah, I'm pretty happy with how it's going.
I still don't really use Word, PowerPoint or Excel,
but the mail stuff seems good.
Well, on the office topic, I also use very, very seldom do I use things like Word, PowerPoint and Excel
only if I really have to through work.
Most of my writing takes place, you know, in a separate application or drafting anything like TOT.
I will say something briefly on Teams.
Teams is interesting, I find. Teams I'm very conflicted about because on the one hand, I think
If you really adopt it, as I have through work, separately in life, it can cut down on emailing.
It becomes a much more efficient way of actually talking to people in your team, hence the name.
And if you're efficient and agreed upon in terms of how you're going to do your file management,
attaching things, cutting down on things like v1, v2, v3, v4 final, v5 final edits with these
initials, and it just drives me nuts, it actually cuts all of that out of your life. So I really
want to praise Microsoft for coming up with something which is, you know, by and large,
a bit of a rip-off of things like Slack and Discord, but tailored towards the work environment.
I think it's very, very good. What annoys me, though, is that because it isn't, you know,
like a natively running application, and it's got that whole, I don't know if it's really Electron
or Java or whatever's going on, I don't have that knowledge, but you can just feel... It's Electron.
It's Electron? Right. Soon to not be. Okay, well, it might be better. I'll reserve judgment for
then. But in the meantime it's just, you know, you go to the about box for example in the drop down
menu and there's no about box. It comes up with this bizarre grey banner, right? You highlight
elements of the interface and you can actually copy them. They're like just sitting text, it's
not proper chrome. You go to define a word with force touch on your trackpad but you can't because
it doesn't actually connect to that part of the system. It just doesn't have the proper font
smoothing that's in other applications. For some reason it refuses to acknowledge AirPods sometimes
or if you do get them working they cut out. So it's like this great work philosophy as far as
I'm concerned that they've achieved with the app but in the way that it syncs with a computer and
even if it's on Windows. I've used it on Windows and it's still displeasing. It's just like they
they didn't get there, they didn't finish the job.
- Yes, Teams.
I've used Teams as well and it's okay.
It doesn't, I just find it personally confusing
because it feels like there are eight ways to do each thing.
And to your point, if everyone is not 100% using Teams
with OneDrive with
You know, whatever
SharePoint thing if you're not using all the stuff a hundred percent it gets real confusing
the only thing that's been driving me nuts with teams is the
The chats it like creates a new chat for every meeting
But you can't delete them when they're done
I don't know why I would want an infinite level like list of chats for meetings from five months ago
And then the teams aspect is weird because there's teams the app
Then there's chat in the app then there's calls in the app, but then there's also teams in
teams
Which is weird
Teamception, I guess that's called and I still don't fully get what the teams are. Are they folders?
are they what are they I don't know are they little wikis they're kind of
everything they're folders there's wikis there's chat there's SharePoint
there's business BI or whatever the hell there's a lot going on in there and I
think the problem for most organizations is that it's just so overwhelming
everyone just quits it's like an operating system inside an app it's like
the American work equivalent of WeChat I find but if I can offer some
some felled foot advice for how you should approach all these different channels, because
as I said, even though the app generally offends me in its design, I do like it as a work environment.
At least very useful where I work. The way that I've approached it is the teams within
the team are the places where you actually live, right? This is where... well, you don't
have to... okay, not in real life, Jason. So yeah, you still reside in Portland, Oregon.
So this is where the actual team discussion happens with the people with whom you are
closely working.
And I love to use the conversations view and actually give every conversation a bold dated
heading.
So that means that when you skim through the conversations, you can actually see, do you
know what I'm talking about here?
No, I'm launching it now.
What are you even saying?
You're like a team's wizard.
Are you like one of those SME teams people?
So let's say you, let's say Hemispheric Views were a team, right?
Oh my gosh.
This is nuts. I'm getting a whole training session right now live people.
This is usually cost money by the way.
This is usually like a silver Microsoft partner service. So yeah,
I'm telling you the way I'm telling you the way you should use it. All right.
So in your team, let's say there's a hemispheric views team listeners.
You can play along. Let's say you have a team that is at work that you have.
Right. Right.
So the thing is if you just start a new thread as a comment,
that is actually incredibly annoying because then it just gets overwhelming in a
of threads and when you're searching for stuff it's impossible. If you press that
little A with like an edit button there you suddenly have the option of doing
rich text and linking and formatting right? You see what I'm talking about?
And then you can add a heading so what I do is for example it would be
2021-09- you know whatever the day is and then something like
meeting on this or project on that or something and then whenever you're
working on that given thing with the people in your close team, you keep all discussion and files
just to that thread and any files that you add are encapsulated or stored just purely within that team.
And then when you scroll through, rather than, you know, you could use the search function,
you can scroll through and see an entire chronological list with headings of all the
stuff that you've discussed in their own threads. What I was going to say about the chat thing,
Chat is really good in the sense of talking to people who aren't necessarily within your team.
But where I found the meeting stuff really handy, you know how you said Jason, like
a meeting that you had three months ago and what's it for, right?
They're both nodding at me like I'm a crazy person. The benefit of those chats is that I
often, for example, will have meetings with people outside of my specific team.
But where do you put the stuff that you were talking about? That ends up normally being
relegated to email and then where the hell's that email? If you had a meeting
about certain files, yes it hangs around but as time goes on it just drops off
and falls into the past. But if you go into your file search, right, at the top
of Teams and you search "what was that thing again?" it will actually surface it
for you spotlight or Alfred style and bring files or messages back from
previous meetings that are stored where the discussion actually happened.
Apple centric podcast my ass you just got teams
no seriously it's an ugly app and it's horrible but this is actually a tool
that Apple is lacking Microsoft's done a very good job with it
teams Wow Wow that that my head is just you know the emoji with the exploding
head that is literally me right this moment that was incorrect that was
incredible that is staying in the show unedited. That was amazing. The only thing I've got to say,
I f***, I actually can't say that word. I really, I really dislike teams.
But it's like Jason said, if everyone's using it and using it properly and there's a system and
you know where things go and you rely less on email, it's very, very powerful. The problem
is that it's ugly. So I'm actually really, you know, without going too much into the work I
actually do, because that's not what this podcast is about, it's just a really, really handy way of
You know having things not be in multiple versions and everyone's living in the same area and look like what was that called again?
What was the subject you can just search it the one thing I said, I had the most Microsofty experience of teams
I thought I'm gonna create a new teams group that was specific to a core like a little project team
I thought I'm gonna create a team. I
Couldn't do that. I had to contact my administrator
Thanks Microsoft
Contact Martin. I was gonna say you can make that a chat
Hmm. Well, thanks Microsoft for designing a really bad information architecture. That didn't make sense to me as
As usual though all of their iOS iPad OS apps are so much better than yeah
it's crazy the difference between the Mac OS versions and the
and iPad OS iOS versions
they're just it's it's clearly two wholly different teams and the iOS people obviously are very
into using iOS because they totally get it and every time I've opened any of the
apps it's like this is fantastic why is this not on the Mac?
It's the same with Outlook I use Outlook on the watch every day to see what
meetings are coming up but and I use it on the iPad and the iPhone all that stuff
but I refuse to use it on the Mac anymore because I would just have all of
this stuff downloading in the background that made no sense filling up my disk so
now I go through Outlook through the browser. Have you tried the new Outlook?
I did it was real weird and it didn't do half the stuff it's supposed to do.
Oh it's bad.
It's better in the browser.
Doesn't have Apple script support.
I get prompted for password authentication every single or every 24 hours with the new Outlook.
With two-factor authentication as well.
So no not a good not a starter.
The other thing I'll say about Microsoft 365.
It's all well and good until you have multiple Microsoft
accounts. I have to, because of my work, I have to have three different Microsoft accounts.
I am never logged into the correct one and it's a disaster. And then you start to have
different browsers for different logins and you have to try to remember which one's for which.
It's horrendous.
Can I switch topics to bring us down off of that high that was teams discussion?
That was really intense and I'm not sure that anyone even has any brain power left to process
anything else we have to say because that was just that was some serious knowledge being dropped
all at once. I did not expect that but thank you. Neither did I. I have two dumb little apps I'd
I'd like to tell you guys about that aren't office related. This is app corner. I think
Can we call it app corner? Is that taken already? I'm not sure if we've done app corner in the past
I don't think so
Let's road test it because one could argue that an app is a form of medium or content which may fit into media corner
But if you can differentiate it enough, we might have a new segment here
That's the Feldfoot speaking. Can I try jingle? Yes
You want apps we got apps. It's hemispheric apps
It sounded a little McDonald's in the beginning, but I'm I'll go with it
I'm willing to pull that out of the episode and include that in every edit from now on
Okay, the app corner of the day two of them that I've found useful as of recent
One is called ETA
the three letters E T a
estimated time of arrival
You put in a bunch of locations in a list with their addresses and you have one nice little dashboard view of how long
It's going to take to get to that location from where you're at right now and you can set them based on car
walking or transit so if you have like work and
Home and maybe like if you go to a gym or something or whatever your normal day-to-day stuff is
It's really awesome to just be able to pull up this quickly and see who traffic is a nightmare
I'm just gonna go ahead and wait before I head home or oh, it's good right now. Let's go
So it's pretty awesome that it just gives you everything you need super quick one view done and it's on your watch, too. I
Had that on my wish list for the longest time and just recently I deleted it realizing that I never traveled anywhere
True, I had not needed it for the last quite a while, but I've been needing it lately and it's been quite handy
Yeah, and anywhere in Perth if you need to go anywhere in Perth, it's either gonna take you 15 minutes 30 minutes or an hour
That's basically that's it. But that's because of distance and traffic, but also there's no alternative ways
It's not like you can go to take the other way to get there quicker. It's like there is one way
You're on the freeway doesn't matter what you're doing. Yeah
Second app coming from our longtime sponsor, Setapp,
is an app that fixed an issue
that I've been trying to solve for,
this is one of those classic things,
you're like, how do I make the Mac do this thing
that I want it to do?
There's gotta be an app for this somewhere.
So I'm looking around, looking around,
came across it accidentally in Setapp.
It's called Al Dente Pro
with a little weird plate of spaghetti
'cause I don't know what it has to do with pasta,
but here we are.
So here's the scenario, let me paint you a picture.
You've got a nice, big monitor, right?
Beautiful, 5K, 6K, whatever K.
You've got a MacBook,
'cause you need it to be portable sometimes.
You love the USB-C lifestyle, right?
Where you put your MacBook down,
one plug gives you power, display,
all your accessories that are plugged into the monitor, what more could you ask for?
Here's the problem.
The M1 MacBook battery life is insanely stupid and lasts far too long for a computer, right?
So you plug it in beginning of your day and you're like, "Oh, I gotta take it somewhere.
Let me take it somewhere.
I go to do whatever."
Come back.
How has the battery only gone down like 1% in the last many hours?
This doesn't make sense.
So you plug it back in.
Then you begin to think, it's probably not good to just have this thing sitting there
at 100% forever.
That's just not good for batteries.
I think we know that now.
But what are you going to do?
If you unplug it, you lose everything.
It's an all or none situation, which is unfortunate in that respect.
I'm thinking, how do I make it, how do I make the computer not be powered through that cable,
but still give me the display and all the other crap?
Is that even possible?
Am I a madman?
I don't know.
Let me go look.
So I'm looking around, not finding anything.
And then I find this plate of spaghetti.
How's that going to help me?
Sure enough, it does exactly what I frigging want.
It lets you say, you can either charge the computer while it's plugged in, discharge
the computer while it's plugged in, or it discharges when it's on battery.
So you can say, "Hey, I'm plugged in, but go ahead and just discharge down to like 50%."
And then once it hits 50, either hold or go back up.
So it's just like a cool little thing that manages the ability to power through that
single cable and somehow cut it off. I didn't even know that was possible. But
here we are, plate of spaghetti, problem solved. So if you're a single cable kind
of person and you don't want your brand new precious MacBook to have a crap
battery in like the first year, check this thing out. It seems to do what
it claims. I watched the battery discharge when it was plugged in so I
I know it was actually doing it.
There you go.
App corner, insert jingle, outro.
- I just wanna know about the pasta app, Al Dente Pro.
Is this something that you're thinking about a lot
when it's on, or is it really just taking care
of everything for you?
- No, it just takes care of it on the back end.
And you can put the little icon in your menu bar
to show you either a plug with a plus,
meaning that it's plugged in and charging,
a plug with a minus, meaning it's plugged in,
but not charging, or if you're off,
it'll just be, I think, a battery with a minus,
'cause it's just doing battery since it's not plugged in.
But yeah, I don't look at it at all now.
I was just concerned because I would main,
the majority of my day is plugged into that monitor,
and I know that that's just gonna be hell in a year
that that battery's gonna be tanked.
And you just, you don't lose battery like you used to,
which I know sounds like a stupid thing to complain about,
but generally you would leave your desk
and go for a few hours to meetings or whatever,
and you'd come back and be like,
oh, thank goodness, I can plug back in
and charge that battery back up.
Now I come back and it's like, you're at 94%.
Like, how?
How is this thing lasting 50 million hours?
It doesn't make sense.
- I have a question.
Does the pasta come with meatballs?
- Don't think so, but that would be great
if the free version had no meatballs
and then the pro version had meatballs.
That would be-- - Yeah, yeah.
- In that purchase.
- Yeah. - Yeah, just, yep.
- Ooh, I'm looking at the icon.
It looks like there's maybe, is it basil in the sauce?
It doesn't look like they're big enough chunks
to be meatballs.
- Hmm, okay. - I'll submit a request.
Yeah, I'll submit a request for that.
- Boop, boop, boop, ba-doop, boop.
That was Hemispheric Apps.
- I'm loving it.
(upbeat music)
this set up, I tell you what.
Damn, I swear that stupid subscription thing is,
it's a goldmine.
Every time I open the thing,
I find something else that is intriguing
or at the very least opens my eyes up to something
that I didn't know existed,
but I use so much stuff from that subscription.
It has to be the poster child or whatever you want to call it
of what you would want a subscription,
software subscription to be.
Maybe that's not true for everyone,
but for me at least, so many apps I use in that.
And just, it's one of, like generally I'll,
you know, new computer, I'll install the basic,
you know, password manager, blah, blah, blah.
Setapp now is like up there in the top three of things I install right away because it's
its own little mini app store where I can just go through and go boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom.
Yeah, I've had it since the start.
I was, um, I subscribed straight away.
I was one of the people that they interviewed for their user stories when they were first
developing the thing.
I can't, I know, I can't quite remember how that came about, but.
Are you on the website?
Like is there a thing from you that says.
There was, I think there was at one point in time, there may have been, right early
on I think I might have had a pull quote but not anymore.
If there wasn't a testimonial, if there wasn't a testimonial on the site with a picture of
you to the side with a speech bubble coming out and you're wearing a tie I'd be very disappointed.
I know I could have said, I could have all my business work done with Setapp.
I just subscribed again just from you saying that, that's how powerful that was.
But no, I've been, so I've been with them from the start and I look at it occasionally
thinking am I still getting value for money? I absolutely am. They have a couple of the
tentpole apps, you know, sort of the big dogs, which are Ulysses and MarsEdit and so on,
which are kind of like the well-known apps that you arrive for. But then there's just
a plethora of other things. And a lot of them I don't need or I've got other options, but
it's still more than pays for itself.
And it's cool sometimes just to try stuff that you may think, I don't know, maybe that's
for me maybe it's not I think I've tried almost damn near everything on there if
it's like oh here's a new whatever I don't give it a shot it's on there I'm
not gonna lose anything that my biggest thing in the beginning was I had a lot
of the stuff already so it was like why am I gonna pay for it again but in the
end as things get revved and there's new versions then it just sort of takes care
of itself here's a question based on your question Jason yeah as mr. default
Do I or do I not have said up you absolutely do not
Andrew no you don't why would you spend money on something? Oh, you know me well. I don't have it no
Not because I'm against it or because I'm cheap. I just went yeah, I don't need it well. I
Love it. I'm glad you love it, and I want to keep hearing about it in app corner. What's the jingling in Andrew?
Atmospheric gaps. It seems like it's getting slightly worse each time
I would take the I would take the recording from the first one probably
Media corner
I am going to talk about a book. We haven't had a book in a while. A book, that's right.
Everybody watches TV these days. See look how look how learned we are everyone. We talk about books and Office 365.
I am listening to a book. Turns out my wife actually read this book about nine months ago
while we were on a holiday and then she gave the book to a person working at the place
we were staying at because they showed an interest in it and she thought Andrew won't like this book
I'm gonna give it to this random person instead so it will get more value
I forgot all about that and then I found this book on audible and I thought I like the sound of that and I've
Liked the author's previous works. I'm gonna get it. So the book is by
Craig Sylvie and it's called honeybee
Craig Sylvie is an Australian author
Even better than that, he's a Western Australian author.
So his previous well-known book was called Jasper Jones.
They even made a movie out of that.
Great book.
So seeing him, I was like, "Right, I'm going to get into this."
It was so nice to...
And now I'm listening to The Audible, and the performer on The Audible, the narrator,
is so good.
does a really good job of that which is another thing entirely. But it's so nice
hearing a story that's based in your hometown and it's sort of it's such a
rare thing for a Western Australian Perth person to hear references to
places that you can relate to because usually it's set somewhere else and I
sort of wonder if people in New York get this feeling at all because or is it
just so common that of course people mention Central Park and West 25th
Street or something and everybody just knows what that means. But I don't, right?
I've been to New York but I don't know it like that. But if you talk about
places in Perth, I know where you're talking about and I can visualize it and
I understand. I talk about the suburb of Hamilton Hill and I'm like, "Oh yeah, I know
what that suburbs like." And it brings a whole 'nother character into this story.
So me as a local, I'm loving it. But the story itself is incredible. It tells
the story of a young boy who's had a really difficult upbringing and is just in a really
challenging environment and is about to commit suicide and is saved by an old bloke and they
form an unlikely friendship.
And it's a really sensitive story.
I don't want to give too much away.
I don't want it to be spoiler of heavy.
But it tells a really emotional story of somebody who, by virtue of their upbringing, their
life has become much harder than it might otherwise have been.
And I'm not quite finished yet, I've got about two chapters left to go, so I don't know how
it ends.
But it really is a really impactful book.
And the characters are so Australian, the setting is Australian, it's a lovely thing.
So Honey Bee by Craig Silvey, really give yourself, don't be horrified by the audible,
get that.
It's 12 hours, but I've been listening at 1x, haven't even sped it up, just been enjoying
it.
So either do that or get it as a real book.
And do you find that you enjoy books more or less or about the same when you hear them?
Probably about the same.
I probably actually enjoy reading a book because I think I can get through it quicker, but
I never sit down to read a book, so I probably, you know, by listening I actually finish it.
That's a good point.
Yeah, I was just interested because I've tried listening to an audiobook before, and the
story you described sounds genuinely interesting.
I couldn't get into the flow of listening to someone else read through my earphones
the same way that I enjoy a podcast.
I'm quite staggered at the difference between listening to conversation and listening to
a text.
would always personally choose just to read because that fits my brain better
but yeah that's that's pretty interesting and I can relate with the
whole Perth thing because no one really writes stories in Wollongong. For some
reason they don't want to take have events take place at Crown Street Mall
it's just not an interesting place. I like audiobooks a lot but it's so
dependent on the person reading it. Sometimes you'll start one and the
person's voice just feels like a screwdriver being stabbed in your head
and it may not have anything to do with them it's just the way that you're you
act you know your brain is interpreting that is just not working which sucks
because you've already bought the audiobook at that point obviously so
it's not like you can return it. So a while ago on micro.blog there was a
conversation taking place between a few people we know about the availability of
of different movies and TV shows in different geographical regions on iTunes, or now what
the Apple TV general interface that exists now. And I think they were from memory talking
about, as an example, the movie Playtime, a French comedy film from years ago. And that
isn't my media corner pick, but it prompted me to think about that whole idea of what
things from different countries are or aren't available in other countries. And I can't
to remember if I brought this up on the show before but it's one of my favorite
programs so if I have I'll say it again I wanted to bring up one of my favorite
TV shows that's ever come out of Australia and then we're gonna get Jason
to see if it's available on iTunes where he is right it's called Review with
Miles Barlow have either of you heard of this? No. Right to me and look I might be
totally overrating it for everyone who is currently listening but this is one
of my all-time favorite Australian comedies so you have to understand that
there was a TV show in Australia called At The Movies with Margaret and David.
Now Margaret and David were two very very popular film reviewers and they
still do it but they had their own program and they would often you know
review the same film but have totally different viewpoints on it and they
would bicker and argue and it became a bit of a running joke that they would
often disagree on the films and it would be like "Oh David you just don't
understand, oh Margaret I didn't like this" and they would just bicker about it.
great television. Well, Review with Miles Barlow was this dark comedic satire of shows like that,
but Miles Barlow is this complete fictitious figure, right, who thinks that it's not enough
just to review art or different activities. You need to go above and beyond for your listeners
or viewers and review life in general. So he has these made up viewers in this entirely
scripted TV show made to look like it's the real deal, sending in letters about,
"Hmm, I'm thinking about, you know, divorcing or killing someone or trying this and that."
And he goes to serious lengths as if it's his real life to come back to the show to
report on the experience of these different life events or circumstances.
So he actually goes out and kills someone and gives it a star rating at the end.
And you see the whole process of him planning on killing someone and coming up with a motive
and then dealing with the aftermath of what's occurred.
And even things like, you know, reviewing what it's like to have self-belief.
And then he goes and enters like this nine step program to see if he can actually achieve
self-belief.
So, I could go on forever about this show, but it's a great example of dark Australian
comedy and even though each of the reviewed segments that he does, whether it's murder
or belief like I said, they end up actually intertwining in a way and you see the effects
on his own personal life throughout the series as he makes all of these horrible decisions
give star ratings on his television show. So that's it. Jason, is it available in iTunes
in the US?
Review with miles who it's not looking good. It is not looking good.
And there you go. So I mean, I'm open to questions about the show if you have any interest, but
what do you think about this whole geographical difference thing? Do we think it's silly that
in 2021, you can't find the show that exists elsewhere within the iTunes infrastructure?
The fact that we have the internet and it's this global, with no boundaries, put a little
star on that, thing, that's what it's always been claimed to be, that's what the vision
for it was, yet it's more siloed than anything else, I feel like.
arbitrarily and artificially and it's complete BS so I completely agree.
So this one was brought to me by my lovely wife and it is called Detective Conan.
It's my new favorite thing ever and it is a... let's see how do I hopefully
describe this correctly... it is a Japanese detective book. I believe it was a book
series first. Well, I know it was but I mean, I don't know if it's a comic technically or a anyway book series and
It is also a show an animated show. It's been going since I think
1996 and it's still going today. So I have downloaded in the way that I previously mentioned
I think we have
100 and something episodes and we started from number one. So there you go. We've got a ways to go
I think we've calculated that we have about three years to catch up
And it is the story is there's a high school detective named
Shinichi and he gets transformed into a tiny child via some magical drug and
Now he is this like amazing detective
But he's small little child. So no one takes him seriously and he lives with this
This guy and his daughter and his the dad is a
detective but he sucks and he's stupid and
So he always basically knocks him out and then like does all the stuff in the background to make it look like he's solving the
Cases it's hilarious and amazing and I love everything about it. I she is known about it forever and
I knew 10 kind of side about it because she has a bunch of the books and stuff
But I never really looked into it. So we started watching it and I'm absolutely hooked and it's just the best
So I I'll it'll be in the show notes, obviously
but I don't know what I'll link to but at least link to what it is and
Try to link you to where you can find it. I know there's some of it on
Crunchyroll if you have that but it only has like
Episode 715 on or something. So you might need to do some
Internet sleuthing to download the rest
But again that gets into that whole question that we just spoke about a second ago of why isn't it just available?
Yeah, surely it's in the interest of said creators for you to discover it because it sounds really it sounds hilarious
I just feel really sorry for this transformed kid detective to be so good at your job and then no one takes you seriously
