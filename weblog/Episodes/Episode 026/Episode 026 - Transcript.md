[Music]
I changed things before you showed up, Andrew, so I just wanted to make sure.
Oh no.
Yeah, I realized that headphones are wireless now, and I don't have to use this stupid cord.
No, but that'll introduce delay.
Oh, I do that already, don't worry. I'm fine with it.
Good luck, my friend.
I can't imagine that like one millisecond of delay from my headphones is gonna really
change things too much, right?
Yeah, you're not editing.
You did sound genuinely concerned though. So this has still got a wire. I still got a wire on this
guy. So everything you're getting is, is fully wire optimized. I'm not pleased. Seriously,
what's wrong with a bit of cord dangling down? It gets in the way, it touches you. It's like
getting in front of the keyboard that I'm not using anyway. It's just a big hassle.
What's that coffee t-shirt? Is that coffee t-shirt? Dunkin' Donuts! America's favorite coffee!
Is it America's favorite coffee? It says so on the shirt. I mean,
how are you going to argue with that? That's true. And it's the best for dunking,
right? No, I don't think I've had coffee from Dunkin' Donuts. I recall having donuts from there,
but not the thing that you dunk it into. Well, like, if I can give my view on - this
this is important stuff. So Dunkin Donuts, it is, you know, it's the best coffee you
can find in America. Keeping in mind that all American coffee is garbage. So it's the
best of garbage.
In Seinfeldian terms, it's the half-eaten eclair that George Costanza pulls off the
top of the rubbish bin.
Yeah, it's probably fair. You know, it's like when I found Dunkin Donuts, I was like, this
This is amazing, such good coffee.
But it's like Stockholm Syndrome.
I'd been in America for a while at that point.
I'd come to accept what American coffee was.
And so it was the best.
To be fair, their donuts literally are the best.
So it's not a bad combination.
There was one that I've had a favorite,
Dunkin' Donuts in Washington, DC.
I could go there now.
I know just the place.
I could take you to it.
So what makes it the best coffee though?
I don't know, it's just got a good flavour.
They serve it in relatively large cups.
It's been a while since I've had it.
It's nostalgic, it's a romantic image, you're walking around with your jumbo cup.
Yeah, you feel like you're a man about town, you know, you're sort of cruising the cold,
because I was always in America in cold weather as well, so you felt like more important kind
of walking the streets with a coffee cup.
That reminds me in New York City. I remember in New York City there became there was a favorite coffee shop
I found just an independent one and
To what New Yorkers man, I got in such good conversations with some of them online as they would say
Just like and there's New York ago, it's just like hey I can't do the New York accent, but you're from Australia
Wow, I was like, yeah, and I found this place like I'm in the hotel around the corner and I found this place and I
like it I'll be coming here every morning he's like this is the best
coffee for blocks you are so lucky you found this place man and I was like this
is New York experience I'm loving it okay I want to make sure I have the
image correct you're there on the street with your Dunkin Donuts coffee and
presumably a donut in tow as well well this is not Dunkin Donuts this is an
independent one in New York oh independent my apologies my apologies
Okay, so alternative beverage slash donut.
Uh, are you carrying slash wearing a briefcase,
Gore-Tex jacket and necktie?
No, because I was on holiday.
So I was in, I was in, you know, cargo pants and all that kind of stuff.
Probably still Gore-Tex actually.
If you come to think of it, it was a puffy jacket.
Yes.
I did have a puffy jacket.
It was, I think it was a North face.
I just assume when you travel, your ties just were a little bit thinner.
I thought that was the only difference.
Or were they thicker on vacation?
I'm not really sure how ties work.
So Martin, that topic already wasn't on the rundown sheet, so I'm sorry, we've already
digressed.
That's okay.
For someone who loves organization, you love to stray from it.
That's okay.
I love chatting with you guys even more.
I love you both too.
That's nice.
Do you want to talk about any of the 911 things that are on the sheet?
This is like the biggest sheet of things ever.
Well I'd like to address the first point really quickly, and when I say really quickly I mean
it because every other podcast with nerdy people on it is going to dissect this topic
endlessly.
In fact they already have, we're late to the party.
So there's just been an Apple event.
I want to know, have either of you committed mentally to ordering any of the products that
either are or aren't available yet?
I don't know about Andrew, Jason, I saw some really enthusiastic messages in all caps that
everything would be bought.
Elaborate.
Yes, everything will be bought.
Also I think I did the little message effect, right?
And you know it's serious business when you do a message effect because it takes a little
bit of work to get that happening.
You got multiple taps involved there.
So quickly, as quickly as I can anyway, yeah, everything was, I thought it was a great event.
I think everything has, like this format is solid.
It has just, this was it.
This was the pinnacle of they finally got it.
Like this felt right.
It was an hour.
It was super tight.
There was a ton of crap in it, but it didn't feel, to me anyway, that it was too overly
jam-packed.
Yeah, it just felt really, really good.
I love their video work that they do.
It's just great.
As far as buying stuff, oh crap.
I should just FedEx you my Apple Card now so it's out of the house because it's over
with.
the air tags. I'm buying the hell out of those. Getting a four pack of the air tags. Love them.
We have tiles currently. Tile being the kind of thing in that space forever.
And they're okay. They sort of almost work most of the time, which is about the most I can say
for it. I had one in a bag years ago that got stolen and it never worked. It never told me
where the hell this bag went that got stolen. So it was like, okay, well that was kind of a waste.
But you had one job tile.
Yeah, exactly. That's what it felt like. It was like it got stolen. It was in San Francisco.
Somebody broke into the car, stole the bag and I was like, ah, shh, everything's gone. But I was
I was like, oh, I had a tile in there.
Holy crap.
This was like, this is their commercial.
Never worked.
Six months later, I got a thing that said
where the tile was and it was like,
what am I gonna do now?
Go find it in a dumpster.
I don't care.
Useless.
So anyway, I'm not saying the AirTag1
is gonna be any better,
but like the way that it does the U1 chip
where you're kind of doing like a dowsing rod situation,
that's just like so cool.
So I'm into it.
They're, as far as I'm concerned, compared to a tile,
They're actually cheaper than the tiles I use now,
which I'm shocked that they're cheaper.
They're $29, which is not cheap,
but the tile pro or whatever the hell I have now
is like $37 or something.
So I don't, I'm kind of shocked that they're that,
you know, quote, inexpensive for what they are.
Anyway, I've talked about AirTags for 20 minutes now.
Apple TV 4K, I mean, it was the most boring,
you know, meh thing I've in the event,
I honestly feel like that part could have just been left out
'cause you updated to a, you know,
an A series chip from two and a half years ago,
which means we could have had that two and a half years ago
and a new remote that I don't,
I'm not bothered by the current remote anyway, so whatever.
Anyway, are we gonna get one?
Yes, because we still have the,
We skipped the 4k that was out previous to just now.
So we still have just 1080p on a 4k TV.
So it's like, okay, we'll get 4k now.
I don't know, that was a pretty big letdown,
I thought, in terms of what it was.
- That's the most disappointing spend of like 250 bucks ever.
- It really is, yeah.
- I mean, we've been holding out on the current,
you know, 4k Apple TV, 'cause it's like,
Well, surely there's gonna be another one at some point
and woohoo, it's here, I guess.
So I wish I could buy it without the damn remote
and get $59 off, but whatever.
- The remote's the best bit.
What are you talking about?
- But it's the thrill, honestly,
living on the edge of which way is it gonna be.
Again, I just--
- Am I gonna have to turn the remote?
- I don't have a problem with the remote.
I don't know.
Everybody seems to have an issue with it
I'm like, it's fine. The amount I use a remote is not very much.
It's Martin's couch casino. He's like, "Whoa, 50/50, which is going to be the trackpad?
Yes! Winner!"
Honestly, people carry on like it's the biggest issue ever. I mean, I can see how there are
some failings of the, well, then, you know, current Siri remote. It happened to me occasionally.
And you know, when it did happen, I went, "Huh, silly me." And I moved on. The world
didn't collapse. I remember that there was famine elsewhere in the world and I
didn't complain about it. Stop being an apologist. That was a hot piece of
garbage. It's not the best but it's not egregious. Yeah I mean it works and the
amount you use in the Apple TV world the amount you use that accessory compared
to something like a computer like you know if my magic keyboard were
were not great, I would probably be upset because that's the only thing I really use
constantly. But with the remote, don't care. But I guess we'll get a new one.
Are you buying seven iMacs?
Oh my gosh. The iMac. So let me just actually, the iPad, M1 and iPad, cool. I don't need it.
So I'm not, you know, if you need an iPad, holy crap, I can't believe there's that much
power in a friggin' I'm sorry, what did I say?
iPad.
I can't believe there's that much power in an iPad.
And it's, I kind of didn't expect that, honestly.
I didn't, I'm surprised there's now M1.
You can get effectively, you know, the same, in air quotes, power performance stuff in
an iPad, a MacBook Air, a MacBook Pro, and now an iMac all have the same heart and soul. It's just,
it's pretty crazy. I mean, I guess we knew this was coming, but somehow now that it's actually
here, it feels very cool. Like this is the future that we actually have the same thing
across this whole platform. And I just feel like we haven't seen anything yet. We keep thinking
like, "Oh, these chips are so cool. They're so fast and quiet." Something big is coming that I
don't think anyone sees with this unified architecture. I'm not even going to try to
guess what it is, but I think we're going to be really, really shocked in the coming years in
terms of what this all means in terms of unification across the platform. But yeah, M1 iPad, great.
You gonna buy an iMac?
These iMacs are gorgeous, first of all.
And yes, I am throwing everything on my desk away and replacing it with a fully specced
orange iMac.
24-inch.
Good color choice.
Big news, you heard it here first, everybody.
Holy crap.
I am shocked that I'm saying this.
My wife is shocked that I'm saying this, but wow.
Yeah, the Mac mini, going away.
Giant monitor I have, going away.
Speakers, going away.
It's all coming down to this amazing new iMac.
- Wow.
Joining the M1 party.
- This is it.
This is my entrance into M world.
And those colors.
Oh, I want all of them. - Oh, they're gorgeous.
- Every single one.
- I want the purple one.
It was a tough decision.
Like with the phones, had there been an orange phone,
no problem, would have been there in a second,
but there wasn't, so I went with the green.
Then the computers, now with the iMacs,
having the orange one, I was like, well, that's done,
I'm getting the orange one.
But if there weren't the orange, wow, I don't know what,
these, maybe I'd go green again,
but the blue looks good, the yellow,
they all look so good.
I cannot wait to see all of them in a store just in a row.
It's gonna look great what I enjoyed most about the presentation when it came to the iMacs was the very deliberate
I wouldn't say it was heavy-handed
But somewhat subtle homage to the original sort of iMac colors ad where they're all spinning around
Yeah, it's a particular shot where you see them flipping almost like cards which mimics the way the bubbles were spinning and I went fantastic
You know, it goes beyond just the rainbow Apple logo or the hello and the flying
Ribbon gymnastic stuff that they're doing it was actually in the ad. So I love that
consistency, like over 20 years later. It's great.
I liked the way they did the ads this time too, where it used to be, they would say,
you know, and we've made a great commercial and we can't wait for you to see, like, it
was this very like deliberate transition from presentation to commercial, but the commercials
just felt like extra presenters this time where it was just roll right into the next
thing. Like the couch thing. I thought that was hilarious. The guy like fell on the couch
and was flying around in there and that was great but it never felt like an ad
it just kind of felt like this is another presenter almost.
Yeah you don't have to have Phil Schiller bolting offstage because they're
running behind time it's just a cross-dissolve transition or something.
Just incidentally I haven't re-watched it so I only watched it first thing this
morning while I was making school lunches right so I had the iPad at the
kitchen as I was spreading Vegemite on bread. Was Tim Cook, you know the Tim Cook
Add where he went Mission Impossible style into the room yeah mission implausible they call it
Was he still was he wearing the same outfit in that that he was in the intro video when he's walking down the path
Because I was like I think he's wearing the same kind of like
And I thought that was kind of like if it was the case it's pretty clever kind of nod to being like the same time
Same day, maybe I don't know if it was the same, but it was definitely a very
Descript dark motif dark thing and he was just ripped
Oh before he just before he announced the purple iPhone. He walked past a purple plant. I don't know
So yeah, you sort of wonder I think I think there's a
Few Easter eggs perhaps. Yeah, he was looking he's definitely been doing the Apple Fitness program
Apple Fitness Plus is is working for him for sure. I
Need to know the secret cuz he is looking lean trim
Whew, all those mindful cooldowns, they help.
The one last thing that I don't even have to buy because it comes with it, the Touch
ID keyboard.
I thought that was friggin sweet.
I never thought we would actually get a Touch ID sensor in a keyboard that was wireless,
but here we are.
So that's pretty cool.
Because I mean, the watch unlock is great as it is.
It's like 98%.
It's one of those features that you get so used to it working that when it doesn't work,
it really is jarring.
And I just feel like at this point with things like face ID and touch ID on different devices,
whatever the ID is you're using, passwords are just like, can we just be done with this
already?
Like I have this stupidly long, complex password that I type in.
I just don't want to type in passwords anymore.
So having the touch ID thing is just one step further towards that realization of no more
And can I ask they know seem like with the iMac they spent a lot of time promoting a lot of time relatively
So short but a lot of time promoting kind of the the continuity handoff stuff. Yeah new
Yeah, I do that now with all my stuff and there's Intel chips in this iMac
So what why did they pump that I have a feeling just to offer this?
I mean
It's not like Apple keynotes weren't watched very broadly before but I feel like more and more people from beyond the sphere are watching it
now that they seem to have shifted the attention to the YouTube channel. I mean, it doesn't
really happen through the Apple TV app anymore, or the sorry, or the events app. You can watch
it through the website. So I have a feeling that a lot more of the not so Mac nerdy people
are watching it. And it's something that's established for us. But since they're pushing
Big Sur, the whole hardware software service integration, it's just a reminder, hey, here's
all the cool stuff you don't get elsewhere. That's all I can really offer. I think it's
a reminder to others. I think too, it's probably a little bit of
a pushback on a lot of the like, like these bullshit Intel ads and stuff that have been
going on lately.
That is like all this, Oh, this PC is better than a whatever.
It's like app, they've never really done that kind of here's features that we do that other
people don't do kind of situation.
So it might be a little bit of that as well.
I don't know, but it is, it did seem kind of like I do continuity and keep in the clipboard
thing constantly, but it's probably, I think you're right, Martin, it's like this is such
a more mainstream thing now that I can see that easily being a thing where people now
have a Mac and a phone and don't realize, "Oh, that's why the little icon keeps popping
up in my dock when I'm on my phone and email.
I just click that and boom, there it is."
So it's probably just a little positive reinforcement of there's a lot of cool stuff that is in
these devices that most people probably don't know about.
And it sells the narrative that they're all on the same chip.
So even though that really doesn't have anything to do with it, it's like, Oh, it's all connected.
Yeah.
Right.
I don't know if, I mean, you guys both have M1s.
Have you noticed anything different in that respect of like, now it hands off faster or
does that, it's kind of the same, I would imagine.
I think so.
I get annoyed with the AirPods constantly trying to switch.
Like it seems like every time I have my AirPods playing anywhere near my MacBook, it's like
saying "Airpods nearby" I'm like "yeah I know, just leave me alone"
"Airpods nearby" 10 minutes later, it's like "yeah go away"
So Jason's buying everything, Andrew?
Well, I'm buying AirTags, I like them, I have a little Chipolo thing at the moment, this
little key ring thing that goes on my keys because I constantly lose my keys, but that's
about the only thing I lose.
The Chipolo one though, that one's supposed to work with the Find My stuff now anyway, right?
Yeah, I haven't tried it yet. It's actually, it's battery's flat at the moment, just incidentally, so it won't work at all.
I need to really replace that.
So, I don't know, I'm not that fussed about them because that's the only thing. I only lose my keys and they're only ever lost like in the house.
So it's kind of like, it's cool, but I don't really see a place in my life for them.
I'd be happy to have some just because of the novelty, but yeah, I just like the fact that they were they replace something
I already have but I feel like it's gonna be a much better version of what I already
Now the the iMac obviously I'm not in the market for another computer and I only bought I've got an Intel iMac
But it's not that old yet, and it's got a bigger screen and it's just fine
So and I've got a million USB 2 devices plugged into the back of it
So I'd be kind of stuffed anyway, if I tried to switch to a new iMac, so that's off the table
But what I am interested in is an iPad
Hmm, and it's almost like my iPad today new
because I
Used my iPad this morning to watch the keynote
All right
And then as soon as I watch the keynote I put it away and left it just was left sitting there
until this afternoon and I quickly pulled it up to look at something else and the battery had gone from like
75 percent to about 22 percent
It had been doing nothing all day in that and batteries draining way. It's like it saw that ad it saw the it displayed
it's you know, it's
Antecessor pretty is that the opposite for predecessor and
Antecedent antecedent, you know, I'm talking about the one that will come next
next. It itself displayed the iPad Pro and that crushed its soul and the battery now
is just a cactus. So I am really interested and as I was watching the iPad ad, the iPad
Pro presentation, I was like this is really cool but this is way too much iPad. I do not
do any graphics work, I've got no graphics skill, I don't make movies, I don't do anything
RT at all with an iPad. I don't need this. Like I need like the iPad Air is clearly the
one that I need. And this Pro is going to be totally out of my price range because look
at what they're putting on it. And then I went to the website and priced the two up
and there's like 300 bucks difference or something between the Air and the Pro. And it's like
well I might as well just get the Pro. Well I can definitely say that the Pro it'll last
you forever. I mean, I honest, the way I, if you had a 2018 iPad Pro, the first, the
first flat edge one. Yeah, it's still more than you really need. It's, it's kind of insane.
And now with the M1 thing, like, holy crap, that thing's gonna last you, you're gonna
wear through the screen with your finger before you even. Yeah, and plus that screen.
The battery will die first.
- Oh yeah, for sure.
Battery will be long gone.
- So how are you buying one?
- Well, not only am, you asked earlier,
are we mentally committed?
Martin Feld, not only am I mentally committed,
I am YNAB committed.
- Oh.
- There is a line item with sufficient funds set aside
for an iPad Pro and potentially even a magic keyboard.
I checked my current usage.
I only need 256 gig based on my current usage.
I'll get that.
I quoted myself on the cellular just because, you know,
I always seem to get cellular in the end.
So why fight it?
- 5G.
- I'm willing to be convinced on that one.
Unfortunately, like 5G, yeah, big deal, man.
- 5G.
- I'm in Australia.
- I know, every time I hear 5G,
It's it's it's the worst thing you could argue at me about a device is 5g of like
4g like tell me when 4g gets here cuz that's a load of crap - also so 5g is just like
Okay, so my I get worse signal and worse battery life awesome. Thanks. Yeah
And I've still got to rely on the Perth to Singapore C-link anyway, so whoop-dee-doo. Yeah, so that's what I'm gonna buy
I'm gonna buy an iPad definitely gonna buy one of those Apple TV Apple TV
I really like it, but before I buy a new Apple TV
I need to buy a new TV because we've still got like a 1080p TV
Which is piece of garbage so old but so there's no point upgrading that although
I was tempted to buy just a remote alone to get rid of that stupid current piece of junk
You can frame it when you're finished with it put it on the wall. I
Can see that I know wait I can see the Jason has a remote behind him
But that's the older older Apple TV remote all the good one. Oh
Yeah, the silver one the one that worked that one yeah there it is
I want I had buttons and you could feel it in the dark and know what you're pushing
Yeah, that one. Yeah fueled by a coin cell battery that children swallow just like the all-new air tags
Yeah, I look at that people are gonna be so happy that they can replace a battery. Oh my gosh. Yay
It's very unapple isn't it? I would have thought they'd be a little you plug it into a little
Lightning adapter or something. I
Thought for sure because they didn't say anything
I figured it was gonna be just stick it on a on a like a magsafe puck or whatever and it would just charge that
way
So yeah, that's my shopping list that leaves one of us Martin Feld. What are you doing? Look?
I might buy an air tag. I suppose I'd like to try it. I might have to skip on the over $500. I may
Key tag accessory thing that they sell. I don't know if you looked at that. Oh, yeah, you gotta get that
Yeah, that's really $500. There are three different options. And I think there's an even more expensive one
It's just I think it's lovingly made by a lonely Frenchman somewhere by hand out of some horse material
I think I think there is a more expensive one that you can only get at
Their store or something like that
So it sounds appealing and somebody would just steal your air tag, wouldn't they?
Yeah, I can't imagine hanging a $700 air tag off of my suitcase like what no if you have a $700 air tag on your suitcase
You're flying privately and no one's touching your stuff except like the guy flying the plane like give me a break
Nope, no stop that that is not
It reeks of like 24 karat gold Apple watch doesn't that a little bit? Yeah
So yeah, I may or may not buy that
AirTag accessory. I'm actually most while I would gladly have everything on the list, but I obviously don't need everything
I am most excited for Jason's most boring product the Apple TV 4k
Just because I have a 4k TV that I've never seen 4k on and that guts me
Anyway, moving on from that as much as I love all the MGS
Eagle, you know
And other blogger predictions of how there should be some sort of home hub enabled
speaker soundbar Apple TV experience that blows up everything else. I kind of worry that that
just ends up being another super expensive thing like the HomePod that a lot of people don't buy.
So I'm not saying that they shouldn't do something like that in the future,
but I was just really really happy that even though it's still a somewhat older chip,
they updated it, they changed the remote, I'm going to have a better experience on my TV,
and I can kind of maintain the status quo of the setup that I like. I like my TV,
I like the HomePod speakers there. It just slots in and makes everything faster and better.
So I'm thrilled not to have to spend too much money on something that will enhance what
I already have. That pretty much sums it up.
Yeah, I could see that. Yeah, I mean, it's only boring in the sense that it's been so
long that the old Apple 4K TV, it just was like to wait that long to then just get a
Spec bump on the chip to a chip that's already two and a half years old just felt kind of like
so the product is you've made a new remote I guess and
By the way, we ran out of the a10 chip. So now it's an aid
It's the it's the next oldest a chip that's about to go EOL. So here it is because it's you know, two bucks
It's not like they were like, here's the new Apple TV
by the way
It has an M1 in it and it can like do all this stuff
And I get that the Apple TV doesn't need a lot of juice for what it's doing like pushing 4k videos not
That big of a deal anymore
But you know I look at Apple Arcade and like some of these games that are coming out on Apple Arcade now
I feel like it's really starting to be
like
Console quality type of stuff and then you give me a chip on the place where I would naturally want to play
An Apple arcade game that's two and a half years old when I have in my tiny
iPhone mini this, you know a 14
bionic superchip, whatever
It's just like it kind of ruins the now I'm stuck with this Apple TV
That's not gonna get updated for eight more years. I sort of think maybe it's strategic
They don't want to cannibalize their iPhone sales for gamers. Maybe you know, they don't want to make it too good
It's not the super intelligent and thought-out or they just couldn't be bothered
It's probably more Tim Cook like use like Jason said use the cheapest chip possible
We got we got a contract to sell another 3 million of these things and we'll buy another 3 million
Now put them somewhere. Yep. It could be I don't know but I am happy that I will have 4k Apple TV
I guess I think that's cool. I do think that screen that screen measure thingy was pretty cool like the calibration
Tool, I think that's that was super clever. I mean if you look at screen calibration
Tools like hardware solutions, they're super expensive and not, you know trivial to use
You have to basically know what the hell you're doing and be some kind of professional screen calibrator
So now to just say like hey hold your phone up to your screen
It's gonna flash some stuff and then theoretically it's gonna make your TV look a little better because no one changes TV
settings. I mean, unless you're uber nerd going in there digging around and, you know,
changing all that stuff, people get it from the out of the box. It's probably the worst vivid
crap mode. And that's it. They just kind of walk away like, Oh, this must be HDR 10 that
everybody talks about. And it's like, no, that's like the garbage in the store mode.
You got to display mode. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that's cool.
I've always been curious about people who would actually willingly choose the cool option because
it just makes everything look like a Nordic noir. Unless you want to make Nordic noir even more
depressing or tense, then I don't know why you would choose that. Yeah, all of the options are
generally pretty bad. It's like there's vivid, which is just really, really terrible. And then
there's like game mode, which I don't think anybody really fully understands. And then, yeah,
Usually movie.
Oh yeah, cinema, cinema, cinema mode.
And also who's changing stuff from, from thing to thing?
Like I'm going to play a game.
Oh, let me go to game mode.
Oh, I'm going to watch a movie.
Let me go to cinema.
Like nobody's doing that.
They leave it on one of them and then move on.
So until the device is smart enough, which now that brings up another thing with this
remote is there's a dedicated TV power button, but like TVs already do that through CEC anyway,
so why do I need this like ugly power button in the corner?
I was super thrilled to see that because whenever I mean I have the CEC set up so I click the
TV button on the current Siri remote and it generally turns the TV on and off with the
Apple TV.
But like you said with the Apple Watch Unlock, one out of every 10 times it won't.
Okay, and then I have to walk up and grab the other one so for me
I'm equally confused
But it's my insurance policy not to pick up the stupid plastic one across the room if it's still HDMI CEC though
It's still guaranteed to be garbage like CEC is the most unreliable technology ever foisted upon us. I think
Like I have basically I've turned off CEC on
Some of my devices because it just doesn't work and then you get like I get a crap
It is an older TV, right?
So even with CEC turned on, I do the volume,
and I use the volume through a receiver.
So the receiver correctly turns the volume up.
The TV knows that it's not doing volume,
yet it still displays its on-screen graphic
for its own volume thing,
even though it's not actually changing.
And it's like, "Oh, just go away."
- My poor mother, and she tolerates this.
I don't think she even finds it annoying,
'cause she's a very patient, good person that way,
it infuriates me inside and not inside I vocalize it too. There's a message displayed on the TV,
not available. Not available. Every time I'm like, no, it is available. It's just not through you.
Shut up television. Yeah, I think I that now that you're saying all that, that I do recall that from
our old TV. You did that as well. I would say yeah, because it was disabled, but it would pop
up and say like volume disabled volume disabled. It's like, yeah, that's because I disabled it.
Thanks
Thank you for the tip
Excellent. Okay. Well, that's the quick
Opening segment. All right, so that's the show as the editor. I declare that the show complete. There you go
There's the hard cut line. So what from the the bucket do we want next?
It's obvious what we want next, you know, we want next Martin Jason and I both want it
Yes, is that baby corner? It is it is this is where I get to make the joke that
that a couple months ago you bought a Mac Mini and then for some reason you
just got another Mac Mini. That's true. Yes. It's very true. What would you like to know?
I don't know if he's awake but we can see. What are the specs? So you got an M1
in there? What's the specs on this thing? Okay so yes indeed we
had a baby. It's a son. We called him Mac and you may call him Mac Mini. Other
people have dubbed him Big Mac, Mac Truck, Junior Mac or MacGyver, it's up to you.
In terms of specs, born at 2.9 kilograms, sorry for the metric, I don't know how to
say it otherwise, 51 centimetres in length and I think a 34 centimetre head circumference,
so that pits it above an M1 Mac, we're talking F1, Feld 1 in this case, super high speed.
How was the foot size?
That's the big question.
The foot size was as expected for an infant.
I don't know what the exact measurements were.
I'm just thinking the felled foot being planted down, you know, it's, uh, well, that's where,
that's where the important aspects lie.
I'll tell you what, even though he's not capable of standing and walking yet, um, he hopefully
will be in the future, but that's how it works generally.
Um, he is very good with kicking, like he's, he's really launching that foot.
So I feel like he's working up to crushing, uh, inferior, um, others.
Is that how it works?
I didn't come up with the felled foot.
Yeah.
He'll be, he'll be, he'll be putting the foot down any day now.
But all jokes aside, we're absolutely thrilled with him.
It's probably the best thing that's ever happened in my life.
I'm really, really absolutely thrilled.
Got parental leave at the moment,
making the most of this earlier time.
The funny thing about the name, if you'd like to know,
it actually started off as a bit of a joke for me.
I was, before Natasha was even pregnant,
if you know, might be sharing this,
I was coming up with joke names,
like, oh, what if his, you know, if it were a son,
what if his first name were Mac
and the middle initials were O-S,
to be like Mac OS Feld. And she thought it was funny. Right. And then because we're Seinfeld
fans, it was like, oh, what if the middle name was Sein and then Feld and ha ha ha all that.
But then it occurred to Natasha, she went, oh, well, Mac actually means son of like it's actually
a name. And she liked the sound of it. And then we made his middle names, John and Peter, who
are my late grandfathers. So it actually means son of and then their names, which the family was
thrilled with. So we're very happy with that. So it's a name that we like. It kind of pays homage
to the nerddom that I've always had and wraps up with the family as well.
So for all the people out there who might have gone, "Oh God, of course Martin thought
of that."
It actually wasn't my idea originally.
So I don't know if that means I've infected Natasha too much with it, but we're happy
with it.
I'm really glad you're not a PC guy because PC Feld, you know, it's kind of not as cool.
This is our son, Acer.
Exactly.
His sister to be, Asus.
Well it's better than iPod Hi-Fi, so good job.
I just feel sorry for the little brother who's going to be named iPad.
Yeah, well, I mean, the initials could spell that, who knows?
You know, the world's our oyster.
But yeah, he's adorable.
I don't know, just a sec.
Natasha?
Natasha?
She's sleeping.
She's asleep.
Yeah, that's alright.
If they wake up.
That's a mother's prerogative to sleep at any point in which she can during the first
months of a newborn.
It's a sight.
Hit the pillow.
Yeah, I'm not going to push it.
I'm not going to push it.
If he's up, maybe.
Well, I just want to say on behalf of the entire Hemispheric Views world, congratulations
to you, Martin and Natasha.
You've done a good job.
Thank you very much.
It's great to have another listener.
We hope he's downloading it already.
And we encourage him to buy us a coffee whenever he's ready to do so.
Well once I start giving him pocket money.
No, but thank you very much.
We appreciate it.
And yeah, it's been excellent so far, even with some sleeplessness.
I have a question for you.
We just spent our quick 48 minutes talking about the things that we said were going to
be very fast.
So what would you do right now if I came into your home, took all of your Macs and/or iPhones
and said, "Okay, now you have to go buy new stuff from somewhere else."
What would you do?
What would you buy today if you weren't allowed for some reason to buy Apple stuff?
Like seriously.
Just to be clear, just to be clear, are we just talking about Mac and iPhone?
We're not getting into the rest of the ecosystem?
Like we're assuming those are the two main devices.
Yeah, like let's just pretend that all you really have is computers.
Like I don't really care about, you know, "Oh, I'm going to replace my HomePod with
a..."
Like whatever, there's ancillary crap, but it's like the main stuff, right?
Like your computer, your laptop that you use every day.
If you had to go buy something else,
what would you buy and what would you use?
Would you use Windows?
Would you use Linux?
What would you do?
And then from a phone standpoint,
there aren't really a lot of options, obviously,
but I thought about this the other day.
What if for some reason the company decided
that they were gonna do something
and you just are no longer aligned with their values?
What would you do?
I know, it's really, I'm having a struggle of a time,
myself, thinking about it, but it just occurred to me,
I think it's a lot of the whole, this Amazon crap,
everything stems from that, right?
Where I've had to find other means of ways to do things,
and it just occurred to me that I just take for granted
that Apple and I are still on, you know,
even, what am I trying to say?
We still share mostly overlapping values
in what's going on.
They don't do everything perfect, no one does.
But if they decided tomorrow that we're taking back
everything we say about green energy
and we're gonna start putting PVC and BPR
and arsenic and everything we make,
and it's like, well, shit, I don't want that.
I'm gonna go somewhere else.
- And children will be installing it.
- Yeah, right, yeah.
If everything went off the rails
and you had to do something else,
What would you use?
I mean, I guess start with maybe,
I don't know what's easier.
I guess the phone part's easier
'cause there really is less options there.
But for me, I figured, I think for like a computer,
I guess I would just try to get
like the nicest PC hardware I could get.
And I think maybe I would try to just use Linux
'cause I'm really not into Windows.
And I probably could get by with Linux, I think.
I haven't, I mean, I don't use it day to day seriously,
but I think I'd probably do that.
And then for a phone, I really, I don't have an answer.
I'm curious if you guys have ever thought like,
I'd probably try this phone.
'Cause I just, none of them,
none of the companies and or phones that I see
feel like things I would want to use.
I don't know.
- I have an answer for you.
- Okay, go ahead.
- As far as the Mac thing goes,
I'll just be up front and say that
even though the iPhone is the thing that I carry around
me every day, and arguably has a lot more practical things away from home. The Mac is far more
personally important to me as the digital hub to use that older term, and also the thing that's
the most versatile or productive, and also the most nostalgic. So I'd be way more distraught
about losing the Mac than the iPhone, as you know, annoying as either of them would be.
I probably do the same thing as you moving to some sort of Linux thing that would ape the look of a
Mac. But as far as the iPhone goes, I would actually consider going to Australia Post
and buying a cheap big button phone and just getting out of smartphones. And I'm not joking,
purely because all of the things that I enjoy about using a phone are pretty much to do with
the iPhone. I've gone into different shops, I've scrolled through the latest Samsung,
whatever and everything. And I'm not saying I'm not just trying to be annoying or sort of
What am I trying to say here? I'm not trying to fire things up, right? I just don't think it's
particularly nice. I don't really like the UIs. I don't enjoy the feeling of it. So given that I'm
already trying to moderate technology usage on something that I love, why would I invest in a
whole new environment, which is probably not as good in terms of privacy, and I just have to manage
more stuff and move everything over? I'd probably just go back to digging out an old iPod, syncing
some music to it if I ever wanted music, and carrying a camera when I want to take photos.
That would be it. So I would take a full step back from mobile use in general and just avoid plunging into another huge ecosystem with endless email accounts and password management, etc, etc.
That would probably be what I would do. I would just step back from technology in general.
It's a separate phone. It's an iPod. It's a separate camera. Are you getting it?
Yeah.
Yeah, three separate devices.
And that's the thing about the iPhone. It's so central to our lives now, but really if you had to give it up, you would just have a more inconvenient family of different devices that all do their own things particularly well.
The Mac is this wonder box that sits on your desk or goes in your bag, which really has form factors and usage inputs and keyboards that are more powerful or extensible than an iPhone in some ways, physically. That's the way I see it.
If I had to do it, I think for phone wise, I feel the same way as you Martin, the computer
would be more of a loss and I'd be curled up in a corner crying for weeks and months
and just thinking my life's not worth living and I'm sad.
But be that as it may, in terms of phone, not such a big deal.
I actually downloaded that Samsung Android demo app and that is the most that I think
I've ever used Android.
What was that like?
What was that like? What was the kind of experience at the end on that?
It was kind of fun. They'd done a good job with the demo.
Like some of the little, you know, gag message threads that were in there and all that were quite fun.
And it was fun. I was like, this is actually okay.
I was like, I can see how people use this and survive on it.
It seemed like Android, like I have used it very little a long time ago.
Usually I'd pick up a friend of mine's phone and just kind of like poke around on it and would always get off put by
the weird blue coloring that the screens always seem to have like non-natural blue colorings and
The bad scrolling and go here you go. You can take your Android phone back
But it's probably come a long way since then in terms of the hardware and the software was fine
So I'm sure I could live with it
The thing I'd miss most probably is the apps that the iOS platform has that aren't on
Android like OmniFocus and that kind of thing
So yeah, I could survive PC wise I'd probably have to go back to a PC
I'd probably try and find like a like a Lenovo ThinkPad or something because I
Remember back in the day the ThinkPads was supposed to be kind of like the best
iPads and I had all the best
Laptops and I had one for one point time in my working career. So I probably go back to that and try and survive on Windows
I I was a Windows user a long time ago. So
Get back into hacking the registry or whatever they do these days
But it doesn't it doesn't entice me. I know whenever I have a surface for work at the moment and
That like they provide it to me and basically it just sits on the shelf
And it's I boot it up very occasionally just so they know that it's still alive in case they have any monitoring stuff on it
That I'm still working, but mostly I do all my work from my Macs
So thankfully that can be done now with all the cloud
Services, but yeah the surface I hate it. I try and use I try and use Windows. I hate that it's also finicky
Don't get the Windows Explorer and how like
How do I just get to find a window like Windows Explorer windows on the screen really quickly at the same time and it's just
Fiddly as anything and no proxy icon
No proxy icon. No, not even quick view quick view is the thing that really gets me about Windows
No, yeah, the amount of times I hit spacebar on a file and nothing happens. It's amazing
That is I can't believe that hasn't been copied. That is the most fundamentally useful
productivity boost
Ever quick view and some form of like a spot whatever you use spotlight launch bar
Whatever the hell one you but just something like that. That is so incredibly
Fast and see you don't even know you're doing it
It just doesn't seem to exist in other places at least they put carpet around the keys on the keyboard. I like the carpet
That's great. It's to catch all your crumbs. You just vacuum it. So it's a good question
I would be I'd be so sad and just think you'd have to use crappy trackpads for the rest of your life
Yeah, I
found this thought experiment to be very eye-opening in the sense of how little there is out there in terms of
competition in
across the board really
for the phone stuff
I feel like I I'm kind of in the camp with you guys where maybe I would go with a dumb phone
But I probably would I I would be more inclined to just say like well
Yeah, I would just get an Android phone. The problem there with me is just the direct tie-in to
Google and how it's like everything has to go through Google now, and I'm just I'm not comfortable with that personally
I don't use any Google stuff. So I wouldn't want to have to say like, oh great now I have to go, you know
transition everything over to Google because I don't feel like that's like a better option for me personally or my other option is then
Samsung and I don't fundamentally agree with them as a company. So I
That kind of puts you back at what else is there? There is no other
OS that's mobile that I am aware of anyway
We used to have kind of three or four, but we don't anymore. We really only have the two
so I it has opened my eyes in some respects to
some of the arguments people have about you know, what Apple is doing verse
Google is doing and how
There really aren't a lot of other options so I kind of get where they're
coming from. I think a lot of it's still overblown but I mean that's just
personal beliefs. But there really just is not a lot of options.
There's a lot of pressure on Apple isn't there to actually keep doing this
and keep doing it well because yeah just think how many stranded people
there would be like us just like. Well it's just the and that's the thing I
mean what I said before wasn't just because all hell Apple they do
everything correctly and I never want to leave. It's just the friction of having to move. So Jason's
totally right with the whole, you know, Google, do you want to be part of their thing or Samsung or
whatever? But just the fact of we have these entire lives bound up with certain services.
And why would you want to move everything and risk? It's just painful. And, you know,
Apple has copped flack before about, you know, killing things like Aperture or different software
or services that's been left in the past. But look at Google's track record of things that get killed.
You go through the effort of moving everything and then, "Oh no, we're not into that anymore,
move on." And it gets added to the graveyard. It's just, I wouldn't be personally motivated to
move everything and go through it all over again. Yeah. I don't remember why this came up in my
mind totally, but I really feel like I would be pretty damn lost. I really don't know what I,
there's no clear like, "Oh, I would just go get this other thing."
There's nothing as nice on either the hardware or the software side.
There just isn't.
You would have to cast aside all of your earthly possessions,
walk into the forest and reconnect with nature.
You can't do anything else.
No other devices will satisfy you.
It's really horrible.
I'm actually, I'm, I'm...
To coin a phrase from you, Martin, of a few episodes ago, I'm shook.
Shook!
Hey, can I change the subject?
No.
Please.
Can we do media?
I've got a media corner that I really want to do. Oh, so do I. Off you go. Wow, I don't have anything.
Go ahead. I'll find something while you guys talk.
Media corner.
Media Corner, Media Corner, Media Corner.
That's good. So Media Corner, I've got one.
Now, there's a little bit of a story leading up to this.
I was on holiday. Here we go.
I was playing with my son, Benjamin.
And as you do, a bit of hijinks, Martin,
let this be a warning to you at the same time.
I decided I would... he was laying in bed and I decided I'd sneak up on him and surprise him.
So I snuck into the room and sort of dive bombed, dive bombed onto his bed.
When he wasn't, and he wasn't, didn't know I was coming.
And so he went...
Was the child here?
What?
Yeah.
He jumped, he jumped as I dive bombed and lurched backwards, which caused his head to
come into contact with my jaw and my teeth crunched together and I chipped my front tooth.
Oh no! That'll teach you to sneak up on people won't it? Uh-huh. There's a bit of a
chunk missing out of my front tooth and I was like well looks like I'm going to the dentist tomorrow.
So I booked an appointment with the dentist. My regular dentist wasn't there. So but I was like
I just need to get this dealt with because it's sharp and it's uncomfortable so I'll just book
in with like whoever random dentist at the same place I go to.
This is media corner correct?
I just want to double check.
It is.
Okay.
I'm getting there.
It's a, I'm building.
The dentist, right?
I never met him before.
Sit down and it's kind of like chit chat.
What are you doing this weekend?
Oh, well, I'm taking my five year old son who did my tooth and my older boy.
We're going, I'm taking them to the wrestling on the weekend.
He's like, ah, cool, fun.
I like wrestling.
I was like, yeah, I've always kind of watched it.
Then me and my dentist, the dentist I'm cheating on with my actual dentist, suddenly I realized
this dentist is really cool and he knows all about the wrestling.
And we're talking like 90s WWF, WWE.
Yeah we're talking about all the classic wrestlers.
The Rock, Stone Cold, Mucherman, Randy Savage.
list goes on right man this dentist I'm serious he's a cool dude and then he was
telling me he's like if you like wrestling you'll really like this show
on SBS. So huh okay do tell it's called he said it's called the dark side of the
ring and it's a wrestling series where they go in and tell like the real-life
stories of what happened in WWE wrestling through from like the 1950s
through to sort of almost present day and I was like okay good good thanks dentist you did a
great job fixing my tooth it's bang up job so well done and then I went home
and I've been binging Dark Side of the Ring on SBS on demand this thing is
amazing it's got it's got all the wrestlers you want to you want to hear
it's got Mick Foley's does it like a mankind you know cactus Jack Mick Foley
he does a piece to camera talks about it they talk about the macho man Randy
Savage and miss Elizabeth they're going into all these stories there's one
coming up on Benoit who went totally crazy because I think too many drugs
that is one thing you'll pick up with a wrestling always too many drugs it's the
root of all problems. That's shocking. Nice pun. You had a different root of a
problem. So, Dark Side of the Ring. So good. If you are at all interested in
wrestling, which I am, then you want to watch this. If you're in Perth and you're
really into wrestling, not only do you want to watch this, you want to go to the
next EPW show. Me and my boys, I took my wife this time, loved it to the point
where even my nine-year-old boy got a cup he got a chant going and he made
crowds laugh with some one classic one-liners so I was just like stoked
he's getting into it wrestling EPW fantastic dark side of the ring media
corner get on it come in for a dentist leave with a friend I discovered this
interactive documentary on SBS on demand and it's only available I found out on
the iOS and tvOS apps. You can't watch it on the website through the SBS.com.au website
or whatever. It's an SBS on-demand interactive documentary called Are You Addicted to Technology?
And it's hosted by this guy called Dr. Kim Lee. I hadn't heard of him before, but he's
an Australian psychiatrist. And it's this relatively short interactive documentary where
there are clips that are shown to you in these different chapters with this overarching theme
of taking the red or the blue pill of the matrix to discover how you're addicted to
technology, but between each chapter you have to answer interactive survey questions with
your Apple TV remote to fuel the next thing and get a rating?
It's really interesting.
Have you named your son after a famous computer?
That wasn't a question but it should have been because at the end my rating was low
addiction to technology and I answered the questions honestly, yes, because when you
watch it, if you do watch it, you'll find that a lot of it seems to be like common sense,
like you go, Well, I know that I shouldn't have this or I shouldn't be overusing social
media. But it's a nice summary. If anyone's out there who goes, maybe I use things too
much. Maybe I want to understand a bit of the psychology because they talk about some
experiments to show the release of cortisol when you receive push notifications, for example.
And it's just a really interesting thing to gain some perspective or maybe share with
people who aren't as aware of their own technology usage. So I was really interested to see what
is a viewer driven, what was it like Bandersnatch? Is that what it was? That black mirror thing
or something? Yeah. I never did that or watched it, but it was interesting to see like an SBS
Australian documentary where you fueled the content with your own answers and then were
compared with the national average. So I hope people outside Australia could look at it,
but we'll try to provide a link. I'd have to go with a game again. I've been playing a lot of
of games and streaming stuff on Twitch a lot lately, which has actually been very
interesting in the sense that there have been a lot of nice people, which I didn't
think existed on the internet, but they do.
Yeah.
They've just been interested in what I was playing and talking to me about it in a
nice way.
And that was very strange considering I was on the internet and Apple arcade.
I talked about earlier, um, the two new games came out recently.
Uh, and one of them in particular called Wonder Box, which is now the
second time that word has been used during this episode in a different context.
Um, it's just a really fun game of kind of exploration and building.
You can create, it's like a sandboxy kind of thing where you can create your own
adventure level things that other people can play.
It's only on Apple Arcade, which is kind of interesting in the sense that it's the most
built out infrastructure-wise game that I've seen on iOS in general that is on no other
platform.
There's no cross-play with Xbox.
It came to Apple Arcade.
That's the only place it is, yet there's this whole backend infrastructure of level creation
and multiplayer across the internet that I just didn't know was possible with just being
on Apple platforms and within the confines of Apple Arcade.
So I thought that was pretty interesting that so much could be done with this platform,
leading me to believe even more like there is really something here with this Apple Arcade.
Let's keep the gas on this thing because I think there's something really important that
could happen with this platform in terms of another gaming platform.
But anyway, I wonder box is on there.
So if you have Apple Arcade, you have it already.
And if you don't have Apple Arcade, you can get it relatively easily.
And I really think this is a, it's a really fun and interesting game for really any kind
of player because there's all kinds of levels.
There's adventure, there's puzzle.
There's kind of, you know, if you're into really difficult, you know, death run type,
you just have to keep dying until you get through a level kind of stuff.
There's that as well.
So it's, it's really, uh, it's really fun.
I like it a lot and I stream it pretty much constantly.
So if you want to see it play, just go watch my Twitch thing and say hello.
Is it the building that appeals to you?
Well, what stands out?
It's the, the art, the art style.
I really, really appreciate and like.
It's very thoughtfully done.
You can tell that the developers and artists worked very close together to create this,
and it's very much a passion project game.
If you're in a world and there's music going, the music's great, and you walk through water
that covers your head, it gives the sound changes and sounds like you're now underwater
kind of thing.
You didn't have to do that, but doing that tells me that you're really paying attention
to everything that's going on in the environment.
And everything's based in this kind of cube that you can spin around, basically.
So you're in the little world, but you can kind of have this otherworldly view and spin
the thing around to get to see different sides of it, because there may be something you
need to go through and then spin it around and now you're on the other side thing.
So it's a very interesting mechanic, I guess I would say.
- I've played a little bit of it
and I thought it was really fun.
I really enjoyed it.
I played it until then my iPad battery went flat.
- Go play my level and give it a heart.
Thank you.
- Oh no, my emergency one was Super Mario Party.
- Funny you mentioned that
because my emergency one was also a video about Mario
and I'm not joking.
(laughing)
Wow. Well, you have to do them both now.
I won't take a huge amount of time.
It's, I don't know if either of you have heard of Great Big Story.
They do all those videos.
No, you haven't heard of it? It's like this channel.
I think they have a separate site from YouTube, but I generally watch it on YouTube.
And they have all these little historical or explainer videos or things you didn't know about anything from an animal to a piece of pop culture.
and they talk to the guy who is actually the voice of Mario
and he's on there explaining the story
about how he came to do the role, the voice acting role.
Really fascinating, I won't ruin any of it
'cause it's a relatively short video,
but yeah, it's just like when you see clips
of the voices behind the Simpsons
and you go, that just looks odd.
And I'm not even a Mario fan, really,
I didn't grow up with it,
although of course I know who he is,
But it's just so in like scanned into your brain to see this guy doing the voice you go that just looks wrong but kind of fascinating.
So that's that's a good one.
Does he say it's a me a Mario.
Oh yeah.
He says all of it.
Yeah.
It's great.
It's me Mario.
