Now we're recording again for the second time.
For episode 084.
For those that didn't join us before the bit we, before we started recording, it's been chaos.
We usually do a tight 30, right? Is that generally? So I'm going to need this to be like a tight
10, maybe 10, maybe 15, tight 15. Can we do a tight 15?
Because Zelda came out and it's really all I care about. I'm barely here. I just have to say,
I almost didn't show up today. I almost called Hemispheric Views HR today and called in sick.
Almost. It was very close. Because I almost had "food poisoning", you know? Because that happens.
You don't know. I'm always confused when these
Hemispheric Views departments come up because you often refer to HR Jason like they're someone else
but you're the one who has done the performance reviews so are you actually talking to yourself?
Well, we don't know. I like to keep kind of a bit of mystique amongst the departments. It's kind of
a part of our culture. It's like severance. You never actually see them or know where they are.
You never really know who's in charge, who's doing what, but things just keep getting done somehow.
So when you walk out into your hallway, do you just get lost in your own house and there's
nothing on the walls and you have no clue what the hell's going on or who you are?
Most days, but I think that's probably for other reasons.
He walks past Valerie holding a cat sometimes, and she just looks at him and says,
"They're not ready yet."
We talked about the HR department.
We also have our international logistics and shipping department.
Is this topic got anything to do with that vaguely somehow?
I'm not sure.
A little bit.
It's more of just a PSA.
Those, those long time listeners know that we all are on micro blog.
Um, we've been there for a while.
We love it.
It's a great little community.
Uh, we're having, um, there is another micro camp coming up, which.
So this show will come out the day before the next micro camp
starts, which is perfect.
So in the U S it'll be Thursday and then it starts on Friday at the micro camp does.
So I just wanted to sneak in one extra little plug there
that if you haven't signed up,
I don't imagine there's any reason why you couldn't
if you're hearing this when this comes out.
And if you fill out the little form
and put an address in there,
you'll get the sticker for this micro camp.
Every micro camp has had a themed sticker design for it.
And this one is no different.
So get in there, sign up,
And, um, I will send you a, I will be sending you a sticker because I have all
of the stickers with me.
So there you go.
Literally go to micro.camp in your browser.
Yeah.
After the first one, when the first sticker that I designed for the first one said
micro.camp, but the domain wasn't actually owned.
So we had to do a quick flip and take out the dot, but then we got the domain.
So now micro.camp does work.
So there you go.
But yeah, the new sticker looks great.
I love it.
I'm very happy with it.
So if you want one, go to micro.camp, sign up,
watch the cool talks and get yourself a cool sticker.
(upbeat music)
- Can I derail this slightly?
I'm gonna move something up in the topic pool just here,
given that it's actually linking to what you just said.
We've only ever done one live podcast,
but I feel like we kind of accidentally
did a split up live podcast in the discord.
#imadethischannellastnight.
So, this is last night relative to our recording.
This will be released later.
Look, I think this was fantastic.
I also want to say that I'm proud and slightly sorry for maybe having started it.
We were talking about Eurovision and stuff, which I can see is something I'm going to talk about in a second as well.
And I threw in something which was an explanation of Australia's love for Eurovision.
And then Andrew said that I basically sounded like an ethnic GPT.
I interpreted that as like a bit of a woggy text generator.
I cracked up on my lounge as I read this.
And then I threw in a ridiculous phrase in Macedonian, which I think my dad used to say
quite a bit as a bit of a joke, which was "Zdravo de la muži de pušam", which is "Hello,
may I smoke?"
Andrew was confused.
I was trying to be a textbook.
And then from there, Andrew went, "Oh my God, you can actually send audio recordings to
each other in Discord."
I had seen this before, like what you have in iMessage, but never really thought to use
visit. Well, the floodgates open, Andrew's singing, he's stumbling, he's making mistakes,
he pronounced equator as Ecuador. I don't know if that's part of Equatorial or Ecuador,
which is not related to the equator, but probably nearer underneath it. I don't know. It just
went off. And then we had, I couldn't believe it, hemispherians contributing their own audio
recording. So I think this was actually quite a nice way of having a bit of a community
shared podcast fragment session. Anyway, thanks to everyone who participated. And if you're
not on the Discord, you can participate in this silliness as much as you like.
One of the things I liked about it was that we started singing. I think it was Sarah that
started singing. And then I took the next line. Now what I want to say, this is a great
idea. I want to see the entire Hemispheric Views community singing a song, everybody
contributing one line at a time. I think it went something along the lines of,
"Thank you for being a friend. Travel down the road and back again." Martin.
I'm pretty satisfied just leaving it at that actually. I don't think I need to
contribute. Yeah, I think that's... I also don't know the words. It was quite the Discord explosion to wake up to, I
I will say, there was a lot of messages in there,
a lot of voice, and somebody had mentioned
that they didn't know that this had existed
and they were apologizing to me specifically
for having this happen.
Yeah, this has been a thing for months.
And when it first got launched,
I was a bit worried to be perfectly honest.
and I just sort of accidentally forgot to mention
that it was a feature.
- I'm sure it was an accident.
- But you found it.
Yeah, oh yeah, absolutely.
And I totally meant to tell everyone,
but it just slipped my mind.
So now you know.
So I expect there will probably be a lot more
voice recordings in our Discord.
- We also have our One Prime Plus members channel in there.
Need to welcome some new-
- Oneprimeplus.com!
- We need to welcome some new One Prime Plusians
to the fold.
They are Rob K and Vincent R.
Thank you very much for your devoted listening
and now your membership.
And by the time this episode is out,
people who are part of One Prime Plus
will have the long promised, much delayed,
hemispheric news in their inbox.
- You know that people want it.
- That's right.
This is a member's newsletter entirely from me,
which, look, there was a poll on Discord.
People wanted it.
I said, no, no.
I couldn't possibly then very quickly change my mind and said that's exactly what the people want.
And look, I'm happy to provide it. So everyone who has already received it,
I hope you've enjoyed it. For people who haven't received it because they're not members,
there's a motivation. You want to hear more from Martin, albeit in written form that takes
longer to consume, what a sales pitch. It's there for you. Well, thank you, Rob K. Vincent R.
Much appreciated as always. Thank you to all the carryover
one prime plus as well for your ongoing and continued support recognizing the new ones
Rob and Vincent but also a little thank you to all those who have been there for a long time now
we love you we adore you we appreciate you we honor you we recognize you we value you
Andrew has pulled out his thesaurus for this segment
I was gonna ask is there anything else we do for it no just is that
We admire you we are devoted to you we are I was going to go into someone appropriate then just move to the next thing.
Just stop.
Okay perfect.
We had some singing courtesy of me I also want to just add on a little bit more singing and then we're going to go into a theme tune.
Okay so guys really important question for you right here have you ever done anything like this before.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Now that sucks.
That absolutely sucked.
Yeah.
That wasn't the best I've ever heard.
So let's flip it to a theme tune that doesn't suck now.
Media Corner.
That was Media Corner. Theme tune. It's a classic. That theme tune?
Produced by Voyager's own Alex Canyon, who is absolutely smashing it on voice and backup
vocals for Voyager as they perform Promise live at Eurovision.
As we record, they have gone through the semi-final elimination into the grand final of Eurovision,
Australia's own Voyager.
These boys and girl Simone have hit the big time.
Guys this is so so huge.
Like tomorrow morning 3am Perth time, 5am Wollongong time, who knows what time in Portland.
Voyager will be performing in the grand final of the Eurovision.
This is massive, it's huge.
Get behind them.
It's too late for anybody who's listening to this, too late for you to vote.
So I hope you voted for number 15.
Jason you're the only one of us three who can vote.
Also we have to clarify almost like SBS style that the telecast has already happened by the time that people listen to this so the instruction of your time is then in the past.
So grab a time machine and go back or watch it on demand on whatever service you've looked at.
And look they could have won the whole thing.
Maybe they came close by the time this goes out.
So whatever happens or rather whatever happened.
Well done, Voyager.
Well done, Alex.
We believe in you.
- Live in the moment,
Jason, you can vote for Voyager tomorrow.
They only open the voting window
for a small period of time.
So you need to be tuned in, you need to be watching.
Your vote, I love this about Eurovision.
So we can vote, all the European nations vote
as the nation of who they are.
Australia can vote for any other nation, but not Australia.
And our vote is recognized as an Australian vote.
Jason, because you are in the USA, your vote is just rest of the world.
Which I think is an absolutely wonderful reconfiguration of global geopolitics, because so often it's USA, USA, number one.
No, you're just rest of the world now.
But you can still vote.
But doesn't that actually support the American kind of stereotypical geopolitical view that they are the world outside of Europe?
No, but they're just, oh yeah, but they're clumped in with the other like.
Micronesian nations, you know, India.
Why are you ragging on Micronesia?
Just rest of the world.
Who's listening? Jason and I love you.
Andrew has the issue.
Please direct anything to the NBL Pocket podcast if you have Micronesian complaints.
Yeah, I'm just sitting here being country attacked.
Don't worry about me.
But listen to this song, go on YouTube and watch their performance.
The grand final performance will be up on YouTube.
Their semi-final performance is up on YouTube.
It was flawless.
Well, I don't know about the grand final.
I'm hoping that'll be flawless, but the semi-final was flawless.
It was brilliant performance.
If you don't, you don't have to like the style of music.
It's a banging song.
Get into it.
And also he's my nephew.
I see a basketball and a big face in my notes. What do we got here?
Yeah. Yeah. So look, good news about Eurovision.
Bad news is now this is, it is all very serious. I've lost my job guys.
Not good.
My contract expires on 30th of June. So I am.
Not this job.
No, no, Hemisphere is just pushing on.
Just so everyone's clear. Like we didn't fire him. He's still going to be here.
So the singing will continue.
I'm working with HVHR.
Yeah.
Ooh, HVHR.
That's pretty good, isn't it?
Yeah.
So there's two avenues I can go down here.
We can either advertise the absolute crap out of OnePrimePlus to the point where it's
generating sufficient revenue for me to pay my mortgage or I go and get another job.
Okay.
So, so I think.
That's the, that's the only two options we have.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I'm thinking really, realistically, I've got a month,
six weeks to go.
I'm gonna have to find another job in that period of time.
So here's my, what I've done,
I'm doing all the normal things.
I'm putting my CV in, writing cover letters,
doing selection criteria for jobs,
applying like a madman, all these different things
that may be good, maybe not,
but I'm just putting my name out there.
But I thought, what else can you do these days?
It's been a while since I've applied for a job.
Maybe I can generate a social media campaign for myself.
So I've create, I loaded Canva.
I've created some panels and I've been putting them up on social media.
It's like, Hey, I'm ready to work.
What's a Canva?
Is that a job thing?
Canva is a, it's like Photoshop for dummies.
Oh, okay.
So that's where this, this, this yellow face picture came from.
It's a web-based design app, basically, with templates and...
Works really well. A lot of people use it.
Actually originated in Perth.
There's a whole story to that. But yeah, started in Perth.
Oh, well, then it's no good. I'm sorry. I retract that.
Yeah, some unicorn company. So...
Oh, that's the yellow then. The yellow is the high-vis.
They only allow you to use high-vis colours in Canvas.
And if you look at the panels that Andrew has created,
because he's got the business vibe with a suit,
Or at least like a button up kind of thing happening with a collar he is legally supposed to according to WA.
Have a high vis element somewhere.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you said panels are there I'm only seeing one of them is there more than one.
Yes only one has been released at this stage which is the quiet this is the opening statement right this is me.
Oh it's like trading cards these are like Andrew Canyon trading.
Keep an eye out for that.
I like it.
So should I, so this one says I'm ready to work.
Let's talk.
Andrewcanyon.com/cv.
Management consultant, podcaster, basketball commentator.
See a bit of everything going on there.
Interestingly, you went with andrewcanyon.com/cv instead of canyon.blog/cv.
I knew that was coming.
I was waiting for that.
I mean, it's a toss up.
Both are pretty SEO heavy.
So, yeah.
Okay. Maybe the next one, maybe the next panel.
So these are the next two.
I'll drop them into this.
The note I'll drop one into the show note.
Yeah.
Right.
Sneak peek.
You guys got to talk me through this.
I changed it a little bit.
Okay.
It's loading into craft.
I need to know whether you guys think these are good or whether I should maybe back off on them.
Right.
So this next one.
I've gone with this now because I'm ready to work. I've put that as a stamp right ready to work
It's very stamp looking. Yes, and and the tagline this time is deep thinking clear communicating
I'm ready to work, you know like
Mm-hmm. Okay, I see it. Ah
You'll like this next one. See if I can get it. Just get this in here. So
Don't know if this is the right audience for real actual good feedback in this
Well, this is I think this is fun. Like I'm trying to make my unemployment an enjoyable activity
And I'm gonna have nothing but time so
Showing my showing my mix of skills
Okay, definitely. Definitely not that one. Definitely not that not this one. So
Probably because of the spelling would be wrong for you. This one says product. No, actually Martin. Can you read it out, please?
Productivity nerd.
Let's optimize.
And then kind of like you can imagine a stamp has come out with a hand and put it at the top left and says ready to work.
Now, I got one more.
I got one more that I've worked up.
And at this point, I was starting to run out of ideas.
Okay, this is definitely a campaign.
He's got images pouring out of folders here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So here's the last one.
Forget Eurovision.
We're going to have to have a vote for these.
probably. Listeners, check the artwork, check the show notes, because you'll be missing out if you
don't have the visual accompaniment here. Oh my God, here we go. He's, wait for this, listeners.
I'm supposed to read a demo? Yeah. Now Jason can do it because he's got the accent that matches
the movie. That's a good point. Yeah, he does. It just says, oh boy, this, you can't use this.
I think this is the best one. No one will get it. But if they do, if they do, the job is mine, right?
That's true that's true you are banking on like the 1% of the 1% getting this it does say TPS reports did you get the memo.
I like it I would hire you for that but I'm not paying.
This is the question is edgy is it too edgy am I taking the piss just a little bit too much like I am actually looking for work.
piss. But can you have a little fun with it? Yeah.
Probably not in the areas that you work in.
I don't know if fun is allowed inside of spreadsheets.
Martin, can I get away with it?
No. Damn it.
It's funny. I'll give you that.
I think it's fantastic. But if you were...
OK, if you were to pay for a LinkedIn
advertising account and you were to target various people according to their interest,
assuming that LinkedIn targeting would actually line up with a movie like Office Space, which has this TPS Reports reference,
then maybe you could do it.
But if you did a mix, I think it could go in there.
But if it were the only one, I don't think it would work.
OK. All right.
So that's my campaign that I've worked up so far.
OK. OK. I'm putting these out there.
If anybody seriously wants to employ me.
Please. I'd actually like to, if we have an extra two minutes here, I'd like to go in a little bit more. Let's call this business corner Andrew's Employment Edition. How about that?
Yeah. Because I kind of like the irony here that we have a business consultant who's consulting us for our advice about his business. And I can't actually say that we're charging by time here. So I think we're being ripped off here, Jason. But out of the kindness of my heart, I will continue. Andrew, how would you sum up your brand?
What's your value to an organisation?
I feel so uncomfortable.
I feel like I'm in a weird... I do too as well.
I feel like I can connect with individuals at a one-to-one level,
but also I can step back and I can analyse a business.
I can understand broader business perspectives.
This is LinkedIn language that I don't want to hear.
Oh, okay.
Right.
Sorry.
You're basically giving me the business equivalent of like an astrology horoscope.
It's like, that's me.
Jupiter lines up with my Uranus to like what.
What do you want from me if you don't want the LinkedIn talk what do you want.
I just want to know what's your brand.
My brand is I'm a good person.
Yeah, what do you offer?
I'm a good person.
I'm trustworthy.
I'm reliable.
I'm I'm sometimes fun to be around.
And I can what are your skills?
My skills are broad.
I can do a range of different things. So I can do, I can do spreadsheets and analysis. I can do strategic thinking. I can also load Canva and do this and then opt and then edit and produce your podcast. So very broad and diverse.
So would you call yourself a business generalist with relevant modern creative skills?
Oh Martin, that is just solid gold.
I hope you copy that down. Put that on your Canva.
If I can throw in some highly obnoxious, let's say, I don't know, branding advice here, I think, and now we're going to go too much into the whole must crush capitalism area.
Something that I find a bit annoying in modern society is that we're all supposed to be specialists, right?
You've got to fill your niche. You've got to do this particular thing well, because that's how you become the cog in the system.
You need to be a generalist, okay? And AI stuff replacing humans aside, you've got to sell
yourself as a generalist because that's what human beings are. We have multiple skills. We exist on a
spectrum. No one fits into one box exactly. So I think if you can sell yourself as a person with
many skills, many different experiences, a crossover between the business and the creative,
that's when luck will come your way. And I'm aware that I sound kind of
bizarre and interviewee at the moment, but look, I think you need to sell the broadness of the
Canyon brand. It's better to be a jack of all trades than a master of something.
Wow.
Because if you're a master of something, that specific machine will replace you.
Can I engage you as my agent at this point? Sports people have agents to find them a job.
All right. Can you find me a job? Just go out and sell me the way you just sold me then.
This is where I think you need a video because right here I mean what's different about putting this in a post than you know from people just seeing your profile image on LinkedIn.
I just grabs the attention because of the high vis.
Um.
Okay so I need a video let me just try it let me.
Without being obnoxious okay and don't do it while you're in your car talking about inspirational messages about something you read in the Warren Buffett report or something.
No no inspo I'll unfollow you I'll disconnect.
I'll disconnect. I'm still dying to know what happens when you disconnect from someone on LinkedIn, but for another day.
Hi, I'm Andrew Canyon. For the last, gosh, almost 10 years, I've been providing consulting services to hundreds of Western Australian companies.
Those companies have seen their productivity, their performance, and their profitability increase dramatically.
Okay, but money is only one element of the story.
What it's about, it's about human connection.
It's about getting people on the same page, working together, and feeling happy to come
into work.
That's part of what I deliver for companies.
But you know what?
It's more than just that.
I've got a broad and diverse history.
I've worked in politics.
I do some IT stuff on the side.
I produce a podcast, such an extraordinarily diverse range of skills.
And you know what else?
I can use a spreadsheet.
I am ready and able to work for your business to take it to the next level in whatever capacity
you think might best fit my particular skill set.
I would love to talk about my skills and how I can help you.
So let's do that.
talk. AndrewKenyon.com/CV. Did you get that memo?
You know what, Jason, I feel like we just walked into a trap. I think this is part of the campaign
that Andrew is doing and he's just linking to this chapter of the podcast from LinkedIn. So.
I think I might do that actually. There we go.
Yep. I think that's what just happened.
Well played. I think it's going to be great when he releases the episode and it's just that part
and nothing else. Everything else is just cut. Now speaking of spreadsheets, uh, Jason, have you
been using any spreadsheets on your MacBook Pro? No, I have not. Well, I mean a couple,
but nothing fancy really. Um, no, I was going to do a quick drive by of Laptop Corner.
So I think we had laptop corner last time.
We're not going to stay long.
Don't worry.
It's fine.
It's just going to be quick.
I actually wanted to just touch on, you know how there's this like,
you can't game on a Mac thing?
Game.
What is that word?
I'm not sure I'm familiar with game.
That's like when you like kill food in the wild and it's like you eat it.
Yeah.
Close.
Close.
If you're playing Oregon Trail, then yes.
But in this instance, I'm more referring to programs on your computer that are meant for fun
rather than productivity or work. Hey, productivity and work is fun.
You're pulling us back, Andrew. You're pulling us back in there.
So I have been playing a lot of games on my new laptop and it has been fantastic. And I just kind
of forgot that you could do that until recently. So I hooked up a PS5 controller, Bluetooth,
Mac OS is just like, I know about game controllers now.
I'm hip and cool.
I've got a whole section in my settings for that,
so that's pretty cool.
And it's connected to my big monitor,
and it's been just a lovely experience.
Everything about new laptop is 55 thumbs up slash 286 eyeballs.
So that's all I wanted to say.
You can game on the Mac.
It works fine.
It's fun.
I'm really enjoying the portability. So there you go gaming on the Mac
When you talk about gaming are you talking Apple arcade games? Is that what you've been?
Playing I have played quite a few Apple arcade games lately
ocean horn
Cronos dungeon I finished that once I've played all the ocean horn games now and
actually, you know, I think Apple arcade gets a lot of crap, but there is a
Remarkable amount of fun games on Apple Arcade. I think people don't I think it's just sort of dismissed
Because it's Apple Arcade
But there's a lot of really fun stuff on there
And if you already have it like download a crapload of them and try them out
Don't just look at the little screenshots in the description. Just download the damn thing
It's free technically if you already have Apple Arcade you have access to the whole catalog
download 50 games and try them out. If you don't like them, delete them. And if you do like them,
yay, play them. So I'm here to tell you, Apple Arcade is actually pretty great. I think it's a
lot of fun and I get a lot of enjoyment out of it. What would you say is your favorite
Apple Arcade game that you've played so far? Oh my gosh, Martin, that question. How could you?
I just did. Hard hitting, as you say.
That's like the hardest of hard hitting. I'm looking through my library, looking through my library.
I'm going to give you not one answer, but probably four, because that's usually how this goes. So
I will say Wonder Box is phenomenal. I love it. I will say all of the Oceanhorn games are great.
I think they're a lot of fun. And if I'm going to pick a third one, even though that last one
was multiple games in one. There's a couple good driving games on there actually,
if you're into driving games like Martin is. And then I'll go with Cat Quest 2.
Cat Quest?
Yep.
What does that involve?
It's like a dungeon crawly kind of thing, but you're like a cat. It's...
Ah, okay.
Go look at it.
When you said that, I instantly assumed it was like The Sims, but you run a cat like a Tamagotchi.
And I was like, you have like a feline presence in your home already.
Is it like, is the real cat suffering?
It's like, like slowly starving to death while you go on a quest with another cat.
No, no, different than that.
Different than that.
Different.
But yeah, Apple Arcade, maybe you've heard of it.
It's good.
I like it.
That should be Apple's marketing slogan for Apple Arcade.
Maybe you've heard of it.
Oh, Fantasian is really cool too.
- I'm a person who likes games,
but never really has the time to fit them in.
Partially my fault, partially, you know,
family obligations and so on.
So I can't actually answer what my favorite game has been
because I never really play it.
Part of my annoyance is actually,
I think the multiplayer experience on Apple Arcade
is not good.
I think they've really thought about multiplayer
terms of multi-devices, right? So if everyone has an iPhone or an iPad and you want to play
across networks or something, then you can do that. But as like, even though I don't think I'm
that old, but clearly as an old man who wants to sit in the room using multiple controllers,
like you would with a PlayStation or an Xbox, that doesn't really exist. So if I'm going to
play something like a game on Apple Arcade, I'm probably going to want to do it with family,
but the setup is not particularly reliable
or multifaceted enough just to get multiple controllers
to talk to each other.
And the games that do it,
it's really, really stunted and weird,
or it's hard to get the kind of party room thing happening.
So I suppose I'd say I've played games that I like,
no standout favorite exists,
and I generally leave it because I go,
I'm not gonna sit here and play it by myself
and not be able to involve family.
So to me, it kind of doesn't really realize its potential as an arcade of fun.
Sorry to turn it to a dark corner, but that's my honest answer.
Hmm. Can I tell you something weird that I found out about the Apple TV?
What's that? The new Apple TV?
I think it's the newest one.
I believe. The 4K with the faster processor.
I think so. I think that's the one we have.
With the remote that is silver.
- Yep.
- And kind of thicker.
- Yep.
- So not the black one, but it's the silver one.
Apparently, it doesn't have an accelerometer in it.
- No, you can't use it like the old one.
- I had no idea.
'Cause for whatever, I had to reset our Apple TV
number of weeks ago, and for whatever reason,
when I kind of started it over,
'cause I was trying to get it hooked up to HomeKit.
Anyway, long story, doesn't matter.
But I did just a reset of it,
And that fixed what I was having the issue with.
But for whatever reason,
it then decided to download every app that I had ever downloaded on the Apple TV
ever. So basically the entire library of Apple TV apps.
And so there was a bunch of them on there that I had not looked at in years,
like just like dumb bowling games and stuff like that. I was like, Oh,
I haven't played this game in like five years. I wonder if this is still fun.
And I load it up, and I'm sitting here like an idiot,
like swinging the thing around, like what the hell's,
why can't I do bowling?
Like what's going on here?
And I just, I assumed like, oh, well the game
hasn't been updated for like the new Apple TV or whatever.
So, okay, that sucks.
And I go online and I look and no, sure enough,
it doesn't have a damn accelerometer in it.
I thought that was like the weirdest thing,
which I guess when they sort of gave up
on the everything must be able to use the Apple remote,
you can just use controllers,
which is how it should have been to begin with.
That was just like a stubborn thing that they were doing,
that they just said, well, screw it,
people are gonna use remote or controllers anyway.
But it still just seemed kind of weird that there was no,
hey, your controller doesn't support it or something.
'Cause I was waving that thing around quite a bit.
And it was doing nothing.
But see, this is one of those extra little paper cuts
that shows that, and I'm saying this as an Apple TV devotee,
I would not want to use a default smart TV setup.
I love the Apple TV experience.
When it comes to things like games,
okay, most hardcore gamers,
and I'm speaking very stereotypically here,
will go for something like a PlayStation or an Xbox,
or have something like a Switch
if that's their preferred style,
because they'll have their game account
and all of their saved data and their campaigns,
and they might do online multiplayer,
it could be anything from FIFA to Halo to whatever, right?
But when it comes to Apple TV,
Apple clearly wants to sell more of these things.
And the way that they can do that is say,
hey, families who want to have this communal experience,
particularly with young kids maybe,
we've got these retro games,
we've got fun family appropriate stuff,
whatever it might be.
And they kind of treat it like
With the kind of TV profiles aside,
which is still kind of clunky,
they treat it as kind of like having an iPhone,
like it's your TV box and it's your personal experience.
The TV is not a personal area,
it's generally a communal area,
whether you live with another person or have a big family,
it's somewhere that people sit around in the living room.
So I just think there's a lot of great content on there,
but it's this box that is kind of treated
like the individual experience of an iPhone,
And maybe you can have profiles on it.
But the moment you want to get people around to play with controllers, sorry, we don't give you one.
Oh, wait, the remote, even though it used to be kind of crap for a lot of people, now it doesn't even work as a controller.
So it's completely bizarre, if you ask me.
Do you use profiles on the Apple TV?
Because we just use mine like I like we have where we both have a profile.
Same. But we just have the one for everything.
Yeah, you don't need to.
And if you have family sharing,
this is where Apple has really thought about it very well,
which is why I find it all the more confusing.
If you go to family sharing under the TV app
and you have a spouse or a child or whatever
who has their own Apple TV store or iTunes purchases,
all those movies and TV shows pop up
and you can just toggle between the libraries
from the family sharing area.
Fantastic, look at that.
Family together enjoying all their content if they want to.
Make it for games and like a party vibe.
doesn't exist. So I think it's a bit disjointed and I need to think of it.
I need to think about that better rant over.
But I will say the stereo home pods still kick an ass.
Love it. It's so good.
Yeah, that's awesome.
It's just the audio quality that we now have with these things is just and it's it's
working. I will now screw myself by saying this, but I'm going to say it.
it's working flawlessly in terms of
whether it's the Apple TV that's doing the audio
or switch to a PlayStation, switch to a switch.
Like whatever input, it really is super, super solid.
And I think I'm fairly certain when you do this setup,
it's doing some other kind of connection or something
like the wireless connection is,
I think it's something different
than just like a straight up AirPlay.
'Cause it's too reliable for it to just be like
an AirPlay, a standard AirPlay.
I think there's some kind of like special
magical connection chain going on.
- It's phenomenal. - I don't know anything
about it. - It's brilliant.
- But yeah, it's just great.
So I will, for no other reason,
if I didn't use the Apple TV for anything,
just having it be the thing for those two speakers,
totally worth it.
Text only toolbars on your Mac apps.
Now, I've always been, if you've got a Mac app, you know, the default sort of toolbar
sets, you can have icons, you can have icons plus text, you can also just have text.
And I've never done this, but I tried it on Dev and Think because so many of the icons
on Dev and think it entirely inscrutable. And it's kind of nice just having text. It
just tells you what it is. Just there's a text thing here it says BB edit. Okay that'll
probably launch it into BB edit. Or if you're Andrew and it says calendar it will actually
launch some other calendar app because that's how he rolls. So it says here I've got a little
window open it has the file name and then it says text. It says save BB edit share zoom
full screen, mark, label, info, tags, inspectors.
That's it.
So right click on your toolbar,
choose text only instead of icon and text or icon only
and see if you like it.
This should work with most appropriately programmed Mac apps.
- I'm trying to find any app that I have that has that.
- Do it in mail.
- You can do it in the finder as an example.
That's an easy one.
- It's kind of awesome.
- Is it?
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah, that's typically what I use,
or icon and text if I can't figure out the icons.
But then it was like, well,
if I can't figure out the icons, just have the text.
- This is actually a really interesting kind of,
I suppose, philosophical user interface question,
because I agree with the suggestion by Sarah.
Is that how we're agreeing to say the username?
Is that right?
I feel like I might be mispronouncing it.
Anyway, thank you, Sarah/Sa.
I think it's interesting because text, right,
is much clearer in its meaning in general than an icon,
which is more of an abstraction, right?
So you can say, oh, browsing the interface,
where's the thing that I need,
which would be for argument's sake, very simply copy.
Oh, there's copy, I press copy, it has been copied.
Whereas if you're unfamiliar with an abstracted
kind of icon, particularly if it's like save,
which looks like a floppy disk,
which doesn't happen anymore,
that's kind of a bit of a risk of going icon only.
However, the thing that I find a little bit problematic
about this with modern flatter user interface design
is do any of these words have borders to show buttons?
Not really.
So then if you look at, for example,
if I click on in the finder in my downloads folder,
if I go text only, you will see text as buttons.
When I hover over them,
I don't have any kind of hovering animation,
nothing changes tint.
And then if I go over just to the downloads title,
is that a button?
Not really.
And then if I look at favorites in my sidebar,
is that a button?
Oh no, wait, there's the toggle arrow
that is as an icon next to it.
So you kind of introduce an inconsistency in design,
which means I found the word which is clear,
but it's not clear what's a button
and what isn't if you only rely on text.
- And I think that's a flaw or a misstep from Apple
and this whole flat design ethos, right?
- That's exactly what I think.
- Like text could be a button.
Yeah, you're right.
Why is it not a button?
It's just, they didn't bother to code in
that the button gets, the text gets a hover state
when it's in text only mode.
- Exactly.
So I think this is a fantastic suggestion.
I definitely think people should try it,
but I think if anyone, I doubt it,
I mean, we're not the biggest show in the world,
but if anyone from Apple is listening and they go,
oh, I have some power in this.
If you can make buttons look like buttons
or have an option for them to be that way,
then you could actually have a world of just text buttons.
And it might be easier for some people,
particularly if they have certain accessibility needs.
So thank you, Saer, for bringing up this,
I suppose, important consideration.
- Yeah, remember when interface buttons
all used to be three-dimensional
and you would push them and it would like press in?
God, I miss those buttons.
I still like those buttons.
- And it isn't a serious issue when you think about it,
'cause younger generations
who don't know what certain icons mean
because they have this historical reference,
icons might be ambiguous to them.
But then you might have older people who rely on text
to understand what something means,
but then, oh wait, that's not a button.
How do you know what is and what isn't?
- And there's so many icons now.
Like how many icons are there in that SF symbols set?
Like thousands, right?
It's too many.
I can't internalize all those.
- Just imagine if we had a proxy icon though, am I right?
- Proxy icons are amazing.
tools of productivity. I love them. People who don't know what a proxy icon is, they
are missing out and they are therefore just losing at life.
Bare equals poked. Losing at life. That's an episode title, I reckon.
Mail.app continues to suck. I hate it. I hate the way it deals with attachments. I hate
the way it deals with threads. I hate Mail.app. I mainly use fmail2 to give me a web view
into fastmail and that's kind of like my daily driver these days because mail.app is just
too frustrating.
But I learned mailmate again earlier today and just remembered how good it really is.
And it's especially good for if you're composing markdown mail or composing mail in markdown.
It's a good way of doing it.
So yeah, mailmate, I own a license I bought ages ago.
I just rediscovered it.
It's like, give it this try.
I think fmail is still going to be my standard.
You don't really have to customize it.
Mailmate, you have to spend a lot of time kind of getting it right.
And if you're on multiple machines, you've got to get it right each time.
But yeah, mail.app, you suck.
Fmail 2 for fast mail is excellent.
If you don't have either of those, use Gmail or something, I guess.
Try mailmate.
Do you guys hate mail.app as much as I hate it?
No.
No, it's fine.
But the attachments, like you drag something in and it's like,
It becomes this gigantic preview of the PDF in line with text.
But I like that.
Yeah, but then you drag something else in it just like renders as a little icon.
And then if you want to save an attachment that somebody else has sent you, it's like,
where's the attachment? You can hardly see it. And then it's like a little paper clip up in the top
right. And you're like, it's like, it's so easy to miss stuff. Like I entirely missed an attachment
in an email because it just didn't present it. I was like, I didn't get an attachment,
But it turns out it did just didn't show it make it obvious.
It's horrendous.
Look we're here for you in this time of need Andrew.
Oh and I should say Outlook is not the answer because Outlook sucks even more.
Electron the electron that they're talking about recoding it I don't believe it Outlook's garbage it's always been garbage.
Ugly horrible disgusting app.
Now I have a question to round out the show and it's not in the show notes because that's how I
roll you know. I was thinking and this is going to be in reference to a photo that I won't include
in the show notes because it's you know a private family moment but I thought it was good stimulus
for a bit of a chat just a quick one. So Natasha was visiting her grandparents took Mac along
and she took this adorable photo of him on the lounge and basically put and she can do this
because she has the woggy background, so you can say this. Put at the top "wogboy" and then did a
little arrow to the multiple kind of protective layers on the lounge while he was eating. You can
imagine the plastic cover from Everybody Loves Raymond, right? Now, that made me think about all
of the kind of charming things that I grew up with that my grandparents would do or different
relatives and how different it was because my mother's side had this Yugoslavian or North
Macedonian background and my dad's side had this kind of Anglo-Germanic-Irish mix. And I remember I
used to get back to my grandparents on the Yugoslavian side, right? And if it was a particularly
hot day, my baba, that's my grandmother, was always concerned that I might get cold if I'd been
sweating. So she would essentially have like a dedicated tea towel for me to put under my shirt
on my back to soak said sweat so I wouldn't get a chill. And I'm thinking, "I'm a teenager, I'm fine,
but thank you for your generosity. I suppose this will help me dry. Charming. I really miss that
about her and Maidero. They would do beautiful things like that, which are kind of funny to
think about, but, you know, really endearing. I wanted to ask each of you, do you have any
kind of funny memories of grandparents or aunts and uncles, anyone in your family where they would
do this really stereotypical thing and you just went, God, that was kind of funny or weird at
at the time, but I look back on that fondly.
I got a couple, only short, short little fragments, my grandparents.
I remember I was never allowed to sit in their chairs.
And that was kind of annoying.
So and I remember a couple of times I got to sit in Granddad's chair and it was like, oh, so comfortable, so much better than the guest chair.
So that was pretty cool.
And then they also had, would have like boiled lollies.
And I'd always want one, I would never feel like I could take one.
So it sounds like they're horrible people, right?
So they're basically restricting me from a bunch of stuff, but they really weren't.
I played a lot of cribbage.
What is a boiled lolly?
Martin.
So lolly, like candy or sweets, right?
And boiled, you know, the way it's done.
But what flavours are you talking about, Andrew?
Like is this hard candy, hard lollies?
Yeah, the hard ones, you know, the stripes, you know, it's like white, but then it's got red stripes through it.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Like tooth breaking stuff that you have to suck on until it softens.
Yeah, you break your teeth, totally break your teeth.
That's probably why they didn't want me to have it.
They were worried about the dental bill.
It's the only type of lolly that an old person would buy, but then they would not want you to have it because then that would be bad for your teeth.
So.
And then it would sit there in the jar for so long, it would actually, they would clump together.
So it would become one giant rock candy.
It's as stereotypical as going to a grandparent's house and going, "Oh, they have those Danish, you know, butter cookies or biscuits.
Oh, it's got a sewing kit out." I had the same kind of problem.
I had the same problem when you would open the freezer and go, "Oh, they've got the ice cream." But my grandparents would use it to fill with pipirki, like stuffed chilies or peppers.
And on my dad's side, I remember my grandfather would say, "Now, Martin, don't spread the butter too much.
It's not good for you, right?
Just lather it on." That's what he would do.
Like totally the opposite of what he told me, you know, stuff like that.
We're going to get back to the Danish tin.
It's blue, right?
It's blue and it has various different biscuits in it, in little doily, paper doily things.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yep.
The little paper.
Yes.
And it's always full of buttons.
There's never biscuits in-
And sewing needles and yarn and stuff.
Yeah.
Have you- Has anybody ever witnessed those actually containing biscuits?
You all know the tins.
Who eats the biscuits?
they scoff them immediately and then put that stuff in.
And then there's always also a drawer in the bottom of some piece of furniture that has
multitudes of decks of cards or like cribbage things or like games never complete always
partial so you have to like get six or seven of each thing to like put together one version of it
Or like dominoes, there'd be all but like three.
So you're like, well, you just sort of like pretend
like you have those ones.
So yeah, every house I feel like must have those things.
Every grandparent's house that is, yeah.
- So did you have a personal example or anecdote, Jason?
Something that's triggered in your mind?
- All of those, I mean, just those things
that I was just mentioning, as you were talking about them,
those all were like spot on, which I think is funny
that that is clearly a worldwide thing.
Just everyone just human nature is to do that.
That is what we do.
We get cookies, throw the cookies away,
fill it full of buttons and like go about our day.
The only other thing I can think of
is there was also always,
there was always a,
not a toolbox, but like a cabinet kind of thing
in the garage full of like just dangerous shit
that was never locked up.
So there'd just be like saws and screws
and just all this rusty shit
that would be the most fun to play with when you found it
and you were always told not to go in there,
but you always went in there anyways
'cause like the only thing stopping you was like a little,
like one of those little bread, you know the little wires
that like have the paper on them
that you like close the bread bag?
It'd have like one of those through like two hoops
or something to like close it.
And yeah, that was, I loved that cabinet.
Never got tetanus that I know of, but it sure was great.
- Well, look, message for the kids.
If there are sores in your grandparents' garage,
have at it.
- But then go to grandma's, Martin's grandma,
because she'll have a little tea towel
that she could dab the blood away with.
Yeah.
- Put on your back.
Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah, exactly.
That's what it's for.
(upbeat music)
That's been a tight, tight 105.
Good point to stop.
Three. No, that's not my job.
Whoa, whoa, slow. You get- you create four panels of yourself in yellow and all of a sudden you
you think you get to do the countdown. It's gone to his head. Wow! You might as
well just say like, "Don't worry, I do the countdown now." That should be your
tagline. All right, here we go in three, two, one, stop.
