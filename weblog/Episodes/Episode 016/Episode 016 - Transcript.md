[Music]
Doing a time check again I think, because things are a little bit different. We're on holidays,
so earliest back in time. Jason, where are you? What time is it?
I am still in the same place, but instead of 5 a.m. It's 9 p.m.
Which is very weird. I've made changes. I'm using do not disturb on all my devices
Because it's it's it's the normal awake hour
I've swapped coffee for wine
obviously
Other than that pretty much exactly the same in this time of year. It's very dark here all the time
So it really doesn't matter that it's 9 p.m. Or 5 a.m. Because it would still be dark
So everything else is pretty much exactly the same. What sort of wine are we talking about here?
I think it's like a rosé from Washington State. I believe I'm not sure don't quote me on that
So as we'd say in Australia, it's it's not a carden or a Riesling
We're going through a rosé fad at the moment in our family as well
It seems to be a lot the drink of choice at the moment in the Kenyan household
That's because it's 200 degrees Celsius where you live. It is pretty warm. Not as hot as it was the other day though
So yeah, my time check it's well you're yet you're still in yesterday. I'm in today because it's Monday 1 p.m
28th of December wait, so you're are you both in the future now?
Because generally Martin's in the future and we're still stuck in the past
Yep, but now you're both in the future and I'm in the past we share the same future albeit three hours apart. That's right
So technically your week has started. Yes, because it starts on a Monday - ending all agreed
Yeah, so the biggest risk we've got me recording at 1 p.m
In the afternoon instead of 9 p.m
Or whatever you should turns out to be is there is a risk of child interference?
So we may hear kids in the background noises screaming
You know - - boys that could well beat each other up just it's just a normal day in the house
I'm in the future as well, shared future with Andrew. It's 4pm, which is very strange because
normally I'm trying to will myself to stay awake and then suddenly I get hit with the happy podcast
hormones and I can't shut up. So this is great. And as a result of it being this time of day,
it's also affected my beverage choices. So like you Jason, like last time, got multi beverage.
This time I've got a homemade piccolo, which you can see there with some fine Nespresso
compatible biodegradable Australian pods, an Arnott's milk arrowroot biscuit. I'm
still seven years old so I have cordial but this time orange and mango flavored.
You'll notice I've color-coordinated the cup again. And of course the fizzy water
staples. So I'm all ready to go and I've you know tried to adjust to the 4 p.m.
time slot. So a lot of a lot of times when you buy kids stuff like food or
drinks or whatever as we're talking about with this beverage, you get little surprises with it.
Is this like a matching cup set that comes with each of the flavors of the beverage,
or do you just happen to have every matching colored cup needed to match the beverage?
In this case, I've just willfully chosen to match the color of the cup with the beverage. However,
you are right, there are numerous promotions flying around. You even see those things like
McDonald's with those Coca-Cola cups and stuff. I'm sure Coddy's has done a similar thing,
but no, this is my fault this time. I'm dying to know what that tastes like,
though. It just, it looks so... it looks like the most fake possible colored beverage there
could be. So I'm so intrigued if it, if it tastes anything like what I'm imagining. Like
it just seems like it tastes like sugar water, but worse.
Look, I can discern the individual flavors of orange and mango. I know some people are
very upset by the idea of merging mango with other flavors. I'm a real mango fan
so I say by itself mix it. I love it. Andrew doesn't look impressed.
I'm perfectly okay with the mixing of that. I don't drink orange and mango
drinks. I will drink, if I'm gonna drink cordial, which is pretty rare these days,
but it will be green or it will be red and that's all I call them. I don't call
them lime or whatever the red is called. It's just green cordial, red cordial.
That's all you need to know about it.
And I just want to point out the other good thing about this time slot is none of us are
wearing pyjamas.
No.
We're all dressed in normal, regular clothes.
So really rounding off 2020, one could say that this has started as the classiest episode
ever.
We've got Rosé, we've got Piccolo, we've got adult daytime clothes.
This is like a business meeting.
This is tax deductible now.
Do we have our agenda?
item 1c on the agenda. I think if we all sign it that means it's official. That
makes it like a company thing so that's great. I think so. Well I mean I was
talking about coffee and I can see something about coffee that Jason's
added. What's that all about? I added something about coffee. Coffee. What did I
add about coffee? Oh! Oh! You can now buy us a coffee. I mean you could before but
But it was weird because it was coffee KO-FI.
So it was kind of a co-fi or a ca-fi.
We're not really sure what that was.
Now it's just buy me a coffee.
And you can do that through any of your podcast players, through any of the websites associated
with us.
And just to get the ball rolling, we may have already gotten a donation recently from a
certain individual that some of us know really well.
Yeah, we always we appreciate the generosity of friends and family and my mom
My mom Jennifer really stepped up and she bought us not one not two not three
She bought us six coffees. That's two coffees each
What a legend and and it wasn't until after she bought the coffees that she realized it wasn't even in Australian currency
She was paying US dollars for the coffee
She's lying on these coffees are expensive
So thanks mom. That's very generous of you. We will be shipping
Hot flat whites around between Australia and the United States that conversions gonna buy a lot of coffee
I think she bought you actually a coffee factory
Sounds like it six coffees. Whoo. So where do people go if they want to buy us even more copies than Jennifer?
Oh now it's a challenge. That's a good point
Really if you care you're gonna go and get seven and then somebody's probably already done that by now
So now you really should probably do eight maybe nine ten. It's an empty text field
You can put in as many as you want or you can just put one but if you go to hemispheric views calm
That's a good place to start. That'll get you everywhere else that we exist
There's a lovely color coordinate logo as well the hemispheric views blue and yellow
Showing up in the buy me a coffee clickable button
Look points for design effort there. I think we've got Jason to thank for that
I would click it just because of that if nothing else
But continue through obviously because you know, yeah, don't leave don't leave coffees sitting in your cart because they'll go cold and yucky
You gotta follow through buy them
No, yeah milk milk is perishable. We don't want that and look
I just want to say as well early on in the episode if people aren't inclined to buy us a coffee. That's totally understandable
We don't expect
But I think a big thank you goes out to everyone who's been listening to us in 2020 because this episode does round out the year
So if you don't want to buy us a coffee, you know
Maybe leave a rating or a review on Apple podcasts or any player join our public discord follow us at hemispheric V
You know get involved send us questions or comments
Tell other people if you like the podcast because you know
We're doing this out of pure enjoyment and the love of our hearts, aren't we?
So that's the thing I think if everybody can if everybody can tell to other people about this podcast
And then we can get some we get some real killer growth going because once somebody listens
They're not gonna not listen again because it's that good right so you get a listen to one one episode in there in there locked in
So tell two people you had the CFO. It's killer growth that we're after but you know really it's just a gratitude
Hockey stick growth. That's what we want. I've got on the slide. I can bring up the PowerPoint if you like and
And please go on iTunes and give us no less than 4.7 stars, please.
Very specific. I'm happy with that.
But you may not see that rating because each store has its own individual ratings and reviews.
Okay, but yes, thank you to all listeners again for joining us in 2020. It's been good to have you along.
So next in the list, I see Media Corner. Are we going for an early Media Corner today?
I think we could.
Yeah, why not?
We got our theme song
Uh, I think I hear it playing right now actually yep, I hear it
Media corner
It sounds really good to me by the way, and that's the end yep, there it goes beautiful
All right, andrew, you're up. Thanks. Welcome to media corner this week
Well
If i'm up that's a bit of a worry because my media corner is a bit light on this week
So light on that the best I can reflect on is a movie. I watched last night, which was absolutely rubbish
I'm I'm I'm anxiously awaiting. Oh, man. This is it's been a bit quite weak for media
the midnight sky
directed and starring George Clooney
In what appears to be a bit of a um ego fest in a way George Clooney seems to get a lot of screen time
He's sort of the the wise old man rocking a David Letterman quality beard
Even noticed his eyebrows eyebrow hair had gone crazy. So look even George Clooney
You know the sexiest man alive or whatever starts to get those old man issues of eyebrow hair made me feel a bit better
the movie itself
It's basically the earth has had a metacritic lismic demise
We don't know why but basically all life on earth is perishing. So now and there's some yeah, and there's a spaceship that has
Returning from a another plan a moon basically a moon of Jupiter
I would say it would and that's like a
habitable planet and
They're returning to spread the good news
Unfortunately, they're a bit late hijinks occur as they travel back from this planet back to earth
Of course, there's drama as the spaceship encounters
Meteor showers and things like that almost destroy it and George Clooney's the only man left back on earth to tell them
Stop turn around. It's not worth coming back
Oh this movie it just went on and on and on my little short synopsis there. That's basically it it took the movie two hours
To a full two hours to get that point across overall like I'm saying Midnight Sky
I give it two stars out of five if I'm gonna I'm gonna put it on letterboxd and five stars would be this podcast
Correct. Yes, so hemisphere reviews five stars the midnight sky two stars. Not a good movie
What got it the second star because right now I'm at like I already turned it off
I'm not even watching it at this point. But what why two stars? Well, it's that's a good point
And maybe it only deserves one, but I just feel like one after the absolute turkey
So I don't want to go too hard.
I started watching, I was watching on Netflix.
It was late at night last night.
I should have been going to bed, but I didn't.
I started off for the first half hour of it, watching it full screen on my iMac.
And by 45 minutes in, I had gone into windowed mode and was having on in the
background as I sort of mucked around on other things.
That's how engaging it was.
Questions.
I have, I have questions.
Um, hold.
Yeah.
Okay.
First of all, I have a question too.
Wow.
Where do I even begin?
Okay.
So you're watching this movie on your iMac.
Why?
And then I guess, secondly, is this a, you said it was on Netflix.
Is it a Netflix original?
Is that what's going on here?
Or is this like a real movie?
Yeah.
Apparently it was, apparently, I think it went into very short theatrical release.
Very limited style.
Oh, is this a COVID movie thing where it was supposed to come out and then it got bought or something?
I think that's might might be what has happened here
I mean, I haven't done the wikipedia research on it, but it struck me as that kind of thing. Got it
Um that you know, it was like, all right netflix needed some content. I have a question. Um, right
So i'm assuming here
Because you're a white male on a podcast with two other white males that you were somewhat motivated to watch it because it was a science
fiction
movie
Yep, however
Did George Clooney play any part in this? Did you see George Clooney with the David Letterman/Gandalf
beard and think, "Oh, he's sexy and from the future now"? Did George Clooney play any role in this?
What's that about? No, George Clooney was theoretically the scientist.
I don't think I'm spoiling it here, but in one of the more profound moments, he talks about the fact
that he just points the way. He doesn't go. So he's modest?
He's the ground-bound scientist manager. Yeah, so no he doesn't really do any
Science, I think the closest thing you get to him is himself administering dialysis
Because he's on he's sort of on the way out
So he that was as close to science is more human biology than space science
He left that to the younger characters on the spaceship to be doing the heavy lifting just to gauge your admiration for George Clooney
In the movie Batman and Robin. Do you think he was a good Batman? The answer is no
In case you're questioning.
To the point that I have not even watched that movie I would say no. Oh goodness
I don't know if I'm impressed or shocked that you haven't seen that movie. That's another media corner in itself
So you've never seen the delights of Mr. Freeze? Don't think so. It doesn't I don't remember ever watching that. No, okay
I'm not going to derail this conversation. Please continue with your media corner. Do you like George Clooney's tequila?
Tequila? With some other guy that I don't know. Yeah, they like motorcycles and there's tequila. Not really sure
That's what the billboard is when he's not floating over Nespresso. Yeah. All right. I've got a I've got a George Clooney like factoid claim to fame
One degree of separation. Wow, you know him personally. That's amazing. I knew it. Yeah, is he a listener?
No, not at all. But um, I was I was once holidaying in Italy and
I
Knew there was a George Clooney angle here. I knew it something about George Clooney personal fun fact and then it starts with oh
I was vacationing in Italy and our yacht just happened to bump into George Clooney's yacht and we had a laugh
Well, it's a bit like that because it was it was just just on the shores of Laga de Como
Anyway, so family friends so some so we have family and then this person
Distant relative of the family is somewhat of a famous musician
Composer pianist and we went to her house for lunch and she had this studio that had like about five pianos in it with lovely
Windows literally like overlooking Lake Como. It's like well, this is like why don't we know this family member better?
I've never met them again since so it was a lovely lunch done once but apparently
George Clooney is just like the next house down. Isn't that how it always goes just down the road?
Yeah, and so they mentioned something about George Clooney and I was like, ah George Clooney
Yes, and so forevermore now I am
Maybe a degree maybe two degrees of separation from George Clooney
He's a close personal friend two stars one star for the movie one star cuz he's my mate, okay?
Good save good say beautiful. Okay, definitely getting into Italy next year
Glad we clarified that we almost lost listen to George Clooney from hemispheric views. Oh, thanks for hanging out George
Appreciate it. We love you, mate. We like we like those oceans movies
I think that they're better. In fact, don't watch the Midnight Sky watch watch an oceans movie
I think that's my media corner done. Okay, Jason my media corner this week is going to be a
YouTube channel and
The person's name is Jordan Harrod. I believe h a r r o d
She has a YouTube channel where she talks about ways in which we interact with artificial intelligence
different algorithms and how technology is kind of making our lives better or maybe worse.
But she does it in a way that it's not... Generally, when you're looking at stuff that
has to do with like AI and all that stuff online, it's real annoying and lame. And it's usually like
some tech bro telling you about how like Bitcoin is going to like, you know, change your biohacking
or something stupid, but she just like tells you what these things are, what they actually mean,
and kind of if they're bull or not, but she just does it in a way that you're just, she's talking
to you and you actually can understand it. Definitely obviously have the link in the
show notes, but I would, I would subscribe to her YouTube channel and check out a lot of her
back content too. If you're at all interested in the way AI is affecting our technologies moving
forward and how algorithms are actually doing what they do.
We talk about that a lot with social networking and all that kind of stuff.
But what does that actually mean?
And when different companies have these "breakthroughs" and then get $40 bajillion on a promise, what
are they actually doing?
And is it actually a promising technology or just kind of more snake oil to fuel Silicon
Valley?
I would definitely check out her channel if any of that is interesting to you.
That does genuinely sound interesting and I'd be keen to have a look at it
because I don't know about you two but I have had to go to some business
networking things in the past where there was some panel about the future of
#AI #MachineLearning and every hashtag you can get to attract the bots on
Twitter to retweet you and it always seemed like there was some manager type
sitting there just talking about the benefits but really broad terms can't
tell you so if she goes specifically into things that would be very
interesting. My Media Corner recommendation is I think one of the most
excellent recent examples of Australian cinema. For those of you who know
anything about Australian cinema you're probably laughing thinking what's that
does it exist? I can reassure you that it does. The cinemas are open and
Australian movies are being made and people like me are actually going to
watch them so I don't know if that means much because I am a nerd who likes the
cinema but anyway I'm gonna proceed it's a great movie that was... hang on can you
just can you just stop there you need to it's not the cinema of course it's the
theatre. Oh the theatre that's right well the theaters however you want to
pronounce it I don't know the place where you go and sit and pay more than
you should for food that probably isn't great anyway the one we saw that is nice
So we went to see a movie that was made and released this year called The Furnace
actually in Western Australia might I add Andrew from your corner of the world
fantastic and it was a furnace here the other day yeah it was there you go it's
it's it's it's recent and it's accurate I really really recommend this movie
particularly if you're Australian but even if you're not Australian even if
you're American because the great thing about this was that it was set in 1897
and I'm not going to spoil anything, but it's kind of like if you took the style of the American
Western and applied it to the Australian landscape. And the story, it tells the forgotten tale. It's
a fictitious story particularly but based on real kinds of people and events of Australia's forgotten
cameleers, right? So we're talking about people who migrated from former Persia, Afghanistan,
India and so on and essentially worked, they did back-breaking transportation labour for
the Crown or the Commonwealth taking bars of gold across Australia's deserts. And it
follows the story of this young Afghan man who becomes embroiled with essentially this
really bad criminal type, this Australian white guy who has robbed the Crown of then
£3,000 worth of gold. It is a really, really great story. You have this feeling of an American
Western but instead of like cowboys and Indians or cowboys and Native Americans and stuff
it's got absolute real different Aboriginal peoples from the land speaking their own language
with English subtitles on the screen. You've got people of the actual Muslim and Sikh backgrounds
playing these roles. You've got the like the earpiece ear-piercing sound of cicadas in the
background as they're crossing these never-ending desert plains. It's really visually beautiful to
look at and a great example of Australian movies done well which you know I mean I think Australians
do make good films but we never have the output or the attention of a lot of the stuff that comes
from the US so if you're looking for something different to watch I'd highly recommend watching
the furnace and I would give it five stars. Sounds like it has a lot more depth than that
dark sky piece of crap that Andrew was talking about before. The midnight sky. Oh, sorry George.
And look, just to clarify, I mean I might have overrated it for you, it is a relatively simple
story. I come at it probably with some Australian bias but I think visually it's very good and it
doesn't overdo the music. It just feels interesting and it's refreshing not to know
most of the cast on the screen. Australians will recognize two or three people in it.
Really fresh, really interesting. So that's my contribution.
Question. You often have movies like this to recommend and you say it's...
Sorry. No, that was not a ding against you.
It was more of a pondering for myself of these Australian films. Do they go outside Australia?
I guess what I'm trying to say is if I wanted to actually watch this as somebody from outside
Australia, is that a reasonable ask? Or is this like, no, now you got to get a Netflix account
in Australia to be able to view it with a VPN and all that? That's a very, very good question.
For this particular example, I couldn't tell you exactly, here's where you can go and watch it
right now. An example like this had one or two relatively big Australian names in it.
and I think there was some international recognition or it was recognised at film festivals
so this is probably a more accessible one but the reason that I often bring up things like this or
think about it is and you know Andrew I'm sure can appreciate it Australian cinema is often overlooked
by Australian people we receive so much stuff from overseas like everyone will rush to go and see the
latest Avengers movie but then something like this which was made often with the assistance of like
government funding, like we're talking Screen Australia and taxpayer money to try to keep
the industry alive, people go "meh, whatever". So yeah, quite often you'll end up seeing very
limited domestic releases because they simply couldn't afford to put it overseas, unless you
have someone like a Nicole Kidman or a Hugh Jackman in it, who Americans or Brits will look
at and go "oh we know him or her from...", it just won't get any attention. So this one I think would
would be easy to find. At that point it's just thought of as a Hollywood film
probably because that's right so it kind of just gets abstracted away anyway so
it's not even really an Australian film at that point if it's got you know Hugh
Jackman or whatever. That's right and so I don't approach I mean whenever I think
of these things and I don't know if you relate to this Andrew it's not really a
nationalist thing I don't go I'm gonna watch this movie because it's Australian
and I like it more it's kind of you you hear these different voices or see
independent things that you wouldn't see anywhere else so quite often you end up
with a more interesting story and that can be the case for foreign
language films too. Not that American cinema isn't interesting there's just so
much more of it. Is there a Hollywood equivalent kind of thing in Australia?
Like is Sydney where kind of film is or is it just happens all over? There are
things like Fox Studios in Sydney or certain hubs maybe where things would be
made but Australia has nothing like an equivalent of Hollywood. Is that right
Andrew yeah, I think so I mean this there's not the people as skills are scattered all around Australia
But there's no there's no hub and really I think getting back to the point Martin was making is that around the funding model
It's so often these films have to rely on government capital to have them made there isn't that
Venture capital Hollywood machinery to fund this stuff, so it relies on government money
And then I think, I'm not a movie expert, but I think part of the mandate of using that
government money is that there is sort of an element of Australian interests need to
be portrayed.
So you end up with more character driven, location driven sort of films where it's showing
what Australia is, or telling stories of Australia for Australians, probably is part of the requirements
of using that money.
Which may actually, funnily enough and very sadly, I think, be one of the reasons that
people are deterred from watching it.
Because sometimes people just want to go and watch the latest action flick or something.
They don't necessarily want to go and see something very cerebral or culturally diverse
or accurate.
So maybe that very fortunate thing of trying to get interesting stories into it is what
makes people go "eh, can't be bothered".
That's a theory.
to find some kind of link for it and put it in the show notes.
Not a problem, thank you Jason.
I've looked at Letterboxd, I've mentioned a couple of times, it's sort of the place
where I go to log the movies I watch, just as a point of reference.
It has given The Midnight Sky 2.5 stars on average.
Yeah, you weren't far off.
And it's given The Furnace 3.2.
Oh, okay.
So, Martin's either super enthusiastic.
Maybe I'm too enthusiastic.
Or it's Americans reviewing this thing and they don't understand it.
Plus Midnight Sky got the Clooney bump and the Canyon bump.
Yes.
So...
Good picks.
I've put it on my watch list, The Furnace.
And that, I'm going to look at the YouTube one as well.
Well yeah, I'll quickly touch on Fitness Plus because it won't take a second.
I have been using a two big giant thumbs up from me.
I've been working at the gym for six months.
So now, you know, flex.
- Oh yeah.
- So, and I'm doing lots of strength stuff.
So I've sort of found that I've just been doing
the beginners stuff on Apple fitness.
So the strength stuff has been fine,
but I've really enjoyed the HIIT.
- Go Kim!
- Which absolutely killed me.
I did like a 10 minute high intensity
interval training session.
And oh my God, I was like ready to cark out
after about eight minutes.
Yeah, yeah, really fun.
But the way that they position it,
The way they film it, they have like the main person
and then the two people either doing an easier one
or a harder one behind them.
So you can kind of pick your level is really cool.
Seeing your data on the screen is excellent.
The way it synchronizes,
like I've watched it on the iPad and the Apple TV
and it all just works beautifully.
Like I will, I've got three months free
'cause I bought a new watch.
And then after that, I'll be buying Apple One premium,
give you everything anyway.
But if I wasn't, I would be subscribing to Apple Fitness
it's excellent it's got me moving and nothing else has done that so well done Apple. Well it's very
encouraging because I haven't tried it yet and I have been enjoying the frequent reminders on
my watch every time you have done one of these workouts so thanks for rubbing it in. Close those
rings. That's right. I'll jump into you real quick with that on that on the fitness plus I think it's
I think it's really well done the instructors are not annoying that they're not like it's not like
some bootcamp thing where they're like screaming at you or whatever. If anything, they're maybe a
little too nice, but I get it. It's hard to get into exercise. Like it's the easiest thing to say,
"Nope, not doing this ever again," and just never go back. So I think it's been really good. I've
done it a few times now. I've put it into kind of a weekly routine for myself where I do,
I'm doing Fitness Plus at least once a week or twice a week. I'm doing now the ring fit for the
Switch, which I kind of thought was stupid and kind of gimmicky and was going to be really dumb.
It's actually really awesome and it's kicking my ass. So I think that again, another really smart
implementation of a fitness thing disguised as a game where you actually want to go play the game,
which is fitness. Like Beat Saber is another one if anyone's looking for for fitness things and you
have a VR setup. For me personally, I found that having multiple options for exercise throughout
the week has been the biggest thing for me. I don't know, sorry I just turned this into like
fitness corner. If I only could do Fitness Plus every week, I think it would die off for me because
it would just be too much repetitive of the same thing. But I found that if I have like two or
three different kinds of things where maybe I don't want to do Fitness Plus today, like I want
to go do a game instead, then I can do that. Fitness Plus, big, big thumbs up for me. The
integration is awesome. The way that it has the, your watch stuff right up on the screen
and you have that, uh, burn bar, I think they call it or whatever, where I'm not, I'm not totally
clear on who that's comparing me to. Yeah. And, and do you want to be at the front or the back?
You want to be at the front because it's effectively the bar is a race and whoever's at
the front is, is winning. I was winning the other day, but I figured that's because I'm super unfit.
So I was having to work really hard.
Yeah. I'm, I'm not sure. I don't know if it's comparing you to like,
just people that you are like Apple watch friends with,
which that doesn't seem likely since it's pretty rare.
People are friends with a lot of people on that.
I think it's got to just be kind of an aggregate of everybody doing it
at all different fitness levels. And it's saying like,
based on what you've done, you're like, you know, a seven.
So we're going to kind of group you with people that are a seven.
I don't know if that's true or not, but I have to imagine that's probably the way it works.
So really it's trying to instill a competitive element because some people will thrive off that.
Okay, that makes sense. So for both of you, it's fair to say that exercise is not a New Year's
resolution for 2021 because you both already started it. Agreed. Yeah, I don't really do
resolutions in like a strict sense of like, I'm going to lose 15 pounds by March or whatever
because I know I'm going to fail at it. And for one reason or another, I mean, this year was a
great example of resolutions or whatever you want to call them not really working out.
I did one in the previous year where I wanted to run a certain amount of miles by the end
of the year, but I find just broader, you know, I need to be more fitness minded going
forward is better for me personally.
So like I've said, you know, I'm going to do at least once a week, I want to make sure
I do each of these activities rather than I need to, you know, shred and be able to
lift 400 pounds by the time it's June or whatever. That's just never going to work for me personally.
How about you, Andrew? Any resolutions? Is that a thing for you?
No, I don't do resolutions. The last couple of years, I've actually followed the Cortex podcast
and they talk about themes. I've adopted that methodology and I found it to be really good.
I'm going to do that again for this year. I'm still working on them at the moment,
what it might be. But what I've got as one of my particular, so my themes last year was all around,
it was actually the year of self-care was last year, which worked out well because,
you know, with COVID and everything, self-care became very important, both
mental and physical. So that worked really well. And that's probably one of the reasons why I've
been doing gymming and trying to eat better and all that over the more recent times. And my year,
my work-related theme last year was agency.
So, you know, sort of choosing when to say no
and applying more structure to my own days
and just being more aware of what I was doing
and what I wasn't doing.
This year so far, I've come up with a couple,
but I think it's probably gonna fall under the theme
of a life examined.
And this gets into sort of the time tracking
sort of stuff as well,
which I've never done before in any real meaningful way.
But I thought maybe it would be wise to sort of understand
how I'm spending my days and seeing if there's,
I can do things better,
am I wasting a lot of time doing something stupid?
Have I got enough stupid stuff in my life?
Because that's important too.
So yeah, I thought, and then fitness can go into that
'cause you can start to track and see how much better
I'm getting with my fitness and all that kind of stuff.
So yeah, life examined was gonna be my theme
As it's a work in progress at the moment.
It's probably a chunky topic,
but yeah, that's kind of the direction I'm going in.
But I need to figure out time tracking.
- Yeah, 'cause I think Jason time tracks,
I mean, you both know my thought
on various levels of quantified lives.
So I don't wanna speak too much about that
'cause I might just end up unfairly (beep) on it.
But I mean, Jason, you're a time tracker.
Do you find it useful?
Because what I will say very briefly
that I had to do time tracking in a previous job. So yes, there is that element that it
was thrust upon me, but I personally found that I was, whatever time I was saving or
understanding by time tracking, I felt like I was sacrificing precious seconds of my life
in tracking said time and then went, what can I do with this? So I certainly don't judge
people who want to track their time, but like, what do you find useful about it? I mean,
because Andrew is thinking of it, I'm not, but what's the benefit?
I would break it up into two different categories really, and that's kind of work and personal.
So the way that I would track time from a business standpoint versus how I would track
my time personally are very different.
So from a work standpoint, and that is work stuff, so it's not entertaining at all, but
I'll just say I have a hardware and I have a software team and having them track their
time. I'm not looking to know down to the minute how much you're getting done every week. I really
don't care. The things that I was more looking for was how many hours in a given week are you
in meetings versus how many P1, P2, P3 bugs are we getting solved, right? And when it comes down
to performance time, having data to be able to say, you know, the majority of my engineers are
in meetings for 23 hours a week.
Being able to have those hardcore numbers to say, you know, half of a person's
given week, they're in doing things that they probably shouldn't be doing.
That other people should be doing.
Personally for time tracking, it's more about somewhat to what Andrew said,
where you got to have dumb stuff too, in your life, like it can't just all be
productivity, get stuff done.
I have to be doing chores all the time.
It's like have I done anything fun this week or for me personally one is like have I had any
This is a bad year example as with everything but social kind of time like how much time this past month
Did I go make it conscious effort to go be with people and hang out with people?
It's for me personally. I could easily just never go anywhere and not really know the difference
So to be able to kind of understand like wow, I really only like went out met up with people for like four hours last month
Maybe I should like work on that. That's kind of a problem or you know
Like we kind of touched on like woodworking earlier where does anyone care how long it took me to make this?
No
But I kind of do for my own sake to know that when I made this thing it took me, you know
86 hours and then when I made this next thing it was like 63 hours. So it's very clear to me that I'm
Learning and understanding better ways and more efficient ways to get things done
Not that efficiency is the goal, but it's just kind of an interesting thing to know.
Yeah, you've got to avoid the big brothers watching your mentality in a work context.
You don't want that. You want it to be like, "Hey, this is helpful for our own
selfish purposes." Not because, you know, "How many billable hours have you done this month?"
Yeah, and billable hours, that's a good point because this kind of time tracking
approach does suit different kinds of jobs. So if you're doing consulting or you're
charging by the hour or maybe doing something like searching for bugs or whatever, you know,
both of you have mentioned, I had to do it in a previous life where if the phone rang the task
had to be changed within the time tracking app and I was doing something like video editing or
something in Photoshop so the kind of work that I was doing was not really relevant to being tracked
by time. Maybe both of you could argue, I don't know, but then it had to be changed to measure
something that also wasn't relevant so I really had that really turned me off it and I still think
I wouldn't really be my thing. I am interested in knowing how I spend my time. I just don't
think I want to use an app for it. But both of what you're saying, I can totally appreciate.
If you can really have productivity gains or become more efficient, or even just know that
you're allocating time for social events, I totally appreciate that.
And what are you using to track that time? I've been using one this year called
Hours, which is on kind of all the normal devices. It's pretty good. I'm a little concerned that
it's not really being developed too much anymore.
It seems a little bit like that's done.
We're going to either, we don't, we aren't a thing anymore,
or we don't care about that anymore.
So now I've been using something called Time Muler, which is a weird word.
It's a software thing, but it also has like this little hardware.
It looks like a, I don't know how many sides it has.
Eight sides, 10 sides, seven, some number of sides, dice looking thing
where you can tie each side to different tasks that you track regularly.
And this is a little bit too far into like what Martin was talking about,
where it's like, I'm on a phone call.
Now I'm emailing now I'm making a document.
Now I'm doing this.
Now I'm doing that.
Oh God, I forgot to flip my cube.
But it's kind of, it's kind of an interesting little thing where you
could just be like, Oh, I'm going to jump on a podcast.
I'm going to.
You know, turn it to the podcast one and then turn it off afterward.
So far it's been pretty good.
I've only been using it for a couple of weeks now, but as with most apps,
There is no perfect app.
And I bet that's one of these things you can't get in Australia.
Don't you hate it when you always get excited about these little hardware
solutions and they're like shipping.
We ship to the continental United States.
I screw you guys.
Oh, I hope not.
But that, that could be the software is free though, which is kind of concerning
because there's no way to really pay for, if you just want to use the software,
which is probably what I would end up doing.
So that's like, uh, if you're only relying on these hardware things for revenue,
Like that seems questionable.
Wait, do you hear that?
Unannounced trivia corner.
I was wondering if this would come up.
I thought you were talking about the crow that just arced outside my window.
I specific, you don't know what trouble I went through to have a crow fly over
your house all the way over there at the exact time that unannounced
trivia corner was happening. I was talking to Hannah about this yesterday,
saying to her, isn't it funny how all the Australian birds are just so angry
sounding. You go to the Europe or America, you know, in our many travels that we do
all the time and the birds are all like tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet and you get to an
Australian bird and it's like, rawr, rawr. Yeah, if Twitter had been invented in
Australia, it would have been called Shriek or Banshee or something. Question
number one. Actually, they're all, I think they're all Apple related this week. I
Apologies for anyone who doesn't care about that.
But okay, question number one.
How many pixels per inch was the original iPhone?
150, 163, 174, or 186?
I'm going to go for...
I'm locked in.
That's what I'm saying.
I'm not going to...
Yeah.
Apple has a love of strange numbers, and I do recall odd numbers in the past.
I'm going to go for B 163.
That was going to be my answer also.
Okay.
Question number two, the eyesight camera.
So the tube one, you remember the tube one, the one with the firewire,
the resolution of that camera was six 40 by four 80,
yep.
1280 by seven 20 1920 by 10 or 320 by four 80.
You want to go first Andrew?
I do I will I don't like I'm gonna say the 320 by 480. I think I'm wrong
I was gonna say the same
It sounds so anemic for like the beauty of that device
It deserves more should be should be
4k, this should be like an 8k camera. I feel like there has to be a way to upgrade it
It's cruel that it should not be some crazy resolution.
Well, no, there was. I can't remember who did it, but someone did a video upgrading it.
They pulled all the guts out.
They put like a raspberry pi in it or something crazy like that.
Yeah, and I have an eyesight camera like yours there,
but I haven't been bothered to try to get everything connected to make it work.
But I do recall hearing that even though the resolution isn't up to today's standard,
the depth that you can get out of it or just something about the physics of the way it's constructed
Is actually much nicer than most things you would buy today anyway, so it's kind of cruel
Yeah, like the resolution doesn't really matter that the optics are really it's not like a little optics
It's a crap piece of plastic in the front cows eyes lens or something question number three the final question of the day
The first Apple scanner was released in what year?
1990
1987
1988 or
73 I'm gonna go for oh no wait now. I'm doubting myself
I'll go for I was gonna say 88, but I'm gonna switch to 90. I'm gonna say
87 and it's a complete
Step in the dark. Okay. Well at least one of us will maybe be victorious in this one. Oh
I think actually last week the V. I think I was right on the VGA cables. You probably were
We'll never know.
I want points!
I hope we will at some stage.
Thank you for playing Unannounced Trivia Corner.
Does that mean unannounced results in the end as well?
Because that's really cruel if that's the case.
No clue.
We'll just have to wait and see what 2021 brings.
Well hopefully more Unannounced Trivia Corners, but I know you can't share that.
And we'll have to start asking you some questions, Jason, you're getting off scott free.
What's the best part about starting Unannounced Trivia Corners?
I don't have to play!
