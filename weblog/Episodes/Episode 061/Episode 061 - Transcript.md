Hi, I'm Andrew.
And I'm Jason.
And I'm Martin.
This is Hemispheric Views.
Do you know why we do it?
Why do we do it, Jason?
For the oneprimeplus.com members.
Well, also the people that are not oneprimeplus.com.
They're also included in that.
You're just as special.
We love you very much, but asterisks, you're not as special.
Oh, there's a slight degree difference of specialness.
Okay.
Well, if you want that extra half a degree of specialness,
you can go to oneprimeplus.com
and sign up today for the Patreon
to get all that cool stuff,
just like our two new patrons.
- Two? - As of the last week.
- Two patrons? - Two, count it.
One, two.
Usually there's one or zero.
That's a valid option as well.
This time there's two.
So this time we've got, coming in around the corner,
Fourth turn of the track, Josh W.
Thank you, Josh.
Much appreciated.
- Thank you, Josh.
- I should start tracking.
- Sounds so official with W, Josh W.
- Josh W.
- Fine, formal.
- Yeah.
W.
- Josh VV.
- Josh VV.
Josh WV.
Lovely.
Oneprimeplus.com member, Tanya F.
I can't do anything else with that
other than Tanya F.
Can I sleep can I see the clarification on that one you have is it is it Tanya or Tanya.
Oh I have to go to a third party judge on that Martin can we get a ruling on that please.
Well since it's my mother who kindly joined as a patron which is lovely she she and I would say Tanya but Tanya why not technically she's Tatiana.
No so TF for ultimate short with initial so thank you Josh W and to my darling mother for joining us patrons.
So you saying if we take Josh W with T Tanya TF we've got Josh WTF.
We do.
Join today one prime plus dot com for that kind of impactful joke making quality that we had right there.
And I'm sure that my mom is thrilled to have her name
(laughs)
form part of that phrase.
- Sorry, mom.
I mean, she doesn't actually listen, right?
That was just a good gesture.
- No, she definitely does.
She's a fan.
She's very dutiful through the subscriptions.
- Wow.
- So thank you, mom.
I do have to do a little shout out
for my mom at this point though,
because I certainly didn't expect her to subscribe.
But even just listening to me on this podcast,
you two are different, right?
She hasn't met you in person.
There's actually some interest or variety or something that she can explore or understand on this show
For me she has spent
Every single day since the day I was born
Listening to me
Aka the Feldfoot to you guys talk we would be on the beach and she would say
It's time to stop talking because we're relaxing and she has chosen to actually spend
Patreon money to hear more.
But I think that's the greatest part, right?
Is that she subscribed to the Northern Hemisphere just out of spite for you.
So I think that was really.
Is that how it works?
I don't know that.
We really should be paying her, I think, at this point.
For the pain and suffering that she's endured.
Yeah.
So, yes, thank you, One Prime plusers.
We appreciate you.
You're awesome.
and anybody that is new, do not forget to go get all the back catalog. There's the newsletter,
there's the episode special audio episodes. Thank you, oneprimeplus.com.
So moving on to Arcadia June. Can I ask you, Jason, I want to ask you straight up and I'm
doing my Tim Cook prayer hands for some reason as I say this to you. It just happened. I'm sorry.
Are you okay keeping track of all of these scores because I noticed it and I went I'm not doing anything to help with this I don't know but Andrew is Jason alright.
Thoughts and prayers for Jason.
Well I can tell you.
From first hand experience.
Should have done it in Excel.
No no it has been manageable.
I use that term loosely.
But it's a good problem to have.
I would rather have there be so many scores
that I'm like not able to keep up with
than there be zero.
It's fine, you know, we do it once a year.
It's not that, if this was every day for the entire year,
I would lose my mind.
But I'm mostly just thrilled that there's been
a crap load of scores this time.
I have to think more than last time
'cause just gauging by how often I'm going in
and migrating and moving scores and stuff,
it seems like there's way more.
And the scores seem way higher.
- Yeah.
- And also there are no blank spots.
So I think at about halfway through,
I think everyone realized that there were spots
that they could literally score a one and be on the board.
So they just started, they just play it real quick,
throw it up there and be like, whatever,
at least I got the spot filled.
So no, it's been fine.
Everybody's been really good about the way they put it in there.
The screenshots are helpful.
Um, the hardest part is if there's not a name looking at the screenshot and
trying to pick out the key little identifiers for what the game is.
Like one of them, there's the little watermelon in the corner and I'm
blanking, I think that's the snake one maybe, but like I've, I've gotten
really good at show me a screenshot from this game, I'll probably tell you
exactly what the game is without seeing anything else.
So if that's a skill, check that one off.
The scores are incredible.
- So consider this your reminder, everyone,
FeldFord's giving you homework,
get your scores in at the last minute.
And following the episode,
we'll do a proper announcement with the leaderboard
and you can see it on the blog, et cetera.
- And then we will do our sophisticated algorithm
to figure out who the winners are
for first place, second place, third place,
which has never been divulged.
It's too complicated.
We don't wanna get into it.
It's really a lot of variables.
Yeah, you don't want to know.
Yeah, you don't want to know about that.
But basically all this stuff goes into a thing and out pops three names who are the winners.
Pressures on Raffaele to build some more mini games, right?
Well, that was, yeah, that was cool too, right?
There was additional games this year from last year.
So it wasn't even just the same bunch.
So he, they've got it over there, create at least three more before next year.
So no pressure.
I have a suggestion for how he could do it.
If he could somehow figure out a way to turn the entire app with the mini games within
it into a game within another app, that would be pretty cool.
I don't know how that would work, but...
I think what he needs to do is build a podcast player into Arcadia, but the only podcast
you can listen to is Hemispheric Views.
Wow.
That's against the spirit of open podcasting, though, isn't it?
You want him to create an exclusive Hemispheric Views player.
I do.
I can already picture the 8-bit artwork with the Hemispheric Views logo and a little play
button.
And you just have, you know, and our music ties in.
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
That's all 8-bit.
It's true.
I would not be mad if there was somehow a multiplayer game in there.
I don't know how that works.
I'm not, I'm not writing any of this code, so I can just throw that out there.
ideas we just have ideas flowing out. What if you had like that breakout one and Andrew could be
playing trying to keep the ball bouncing to hit the bricks but then I'm there trying to knock his
brick out of the way so the ball goes through. What about brick out where the little toboggan
thing is actually a foot and then the thing that you're bouncing up and down the ball is a basketball.
The basketball yeah. Yeah and then everything that you're shooting all the bricks maybe there'd be
Robots.
Just saying.
Easter egg.
I like it.
So I'm using you as a weapon to destroy Jason.
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think it works for me.
That's fine.
I mean, I feel like that's how these shows usually go, right?
And so it's kind of on brand.
Cool.
Raffaella, make it happen.
I was just curious.
Did either of you have senior year paraphernalia, whether it was
jackets, jumpers, sweaters, different merchandise or branded stuff, or
Or did you even have things like nicknames or any memories associated with it?
Maybe we should start with the American.
In terms of paraphernalia, I just like saying that, by the way.
Every trope/thing you just said is absolutely a thing here.
The letters, the jackets.
I mean not for if you're in sports or some kind of thing that warrants having that stuff.
I know it will be a very big shock to anyone listening to this that I was not in any of
those areas where you would be receiving such jackets or letters or otherwise.
No could could not.
I thought your school nickname might have been jocks and Burke.
You would think, given my sports ability.
No, I don't have any of that.
I think the other thing that you missed was yearbooks.
That's the other big, classic paraphernalia
that you get in high school.
No, I don't have any of that to date.
was asked not to come back to high school at one point.
So that happened.
So I never actually had a chance to get any of that
said paraphernalia from senior year.
Not that I would want it, but yeah, so that happened.
- Things like nicknames or certain memories
or things that came to a point at that time.
- Lockers, I don't know, those just stand out in my mind
still the stupid lockers that are just, ugh, they're just the worst.
I love my locker!
What are you talking about?
I did, I did, I can go on a whole locker spiel if you want me to.
Okay well- I never had one.
Oh.
It wasn't a thing.
Interesting.
Yeah it was something that people just kind of had near the uh, the cooking rooms or whatever
like the kitchen class stuff and I never knew why some people had them and the rest of the
school didn't so it was a bit weird.
Hold on, I just remembered another thing that you didn't mention that I don't care about.
Class rings.
That goes in with that too.
Like a finger ring with like a...
It costs way too much, it's made out of materials that no one cares about and it says like your
high school name on it.
Like I did not.
I find a lot of it kind of cringy myself so I didn't have expectations of the whole positive
list of things.
It was like, "Ah."
Andrew you are you got stuffed in lockers you said yeah I did so I we have the lockers that were there a half height.
Stacked you had the low ones in the highlands and I am we all gonna sign the locker and I gotta sign the low one.
This some yeah give the talk around the bar exactly so I paid a short kid 5 bucks and we swap lockers.
So that was that problem dealt with.
But the thing I loved about lockers was it was like your own little home at school.
And so I developed a complete system of packing my locker.
So it was completely organized.
Books stacked, you know, the big book on the left, down in size.
There was a particular place for my lunchbox that went there.
Had the jacket, you know, that you have on a hanger, of course, because we had to wear
blazers sometimes because it's kind of school.
You had to wear a blazer.
you had to have a hangar for your blazers. It was all organized.
Total, total.
And you would never upset the- and I'd go to other kids lockers and they'd be like,
just throwing stuff in.
I'm like, what are you doing?
I was-
Like they're kids or something.
I know.
I was very- and there was one particular economics book I still remember, and I
loved this economics book.
There was something about it.
Of course he does.
It was, it was just the size of it, the texture of the pages.
It became very precious to me.
And I had it, you know, contact when you contact books to protect.
I was going to ask, did you have it laminated in contact?
Did you do it or did you mum?
My mum did it.
My mum did it. I couldn't contact a book to save myself, but my mum did it.
And she did. I told her, I said, this book is important to me.
Please do it really well.
And she did. Perfect corners.
And so this book, I even had a special method for packing my school bag
So that it would sit flat on my bag, the base of my bag,
this is like a duffle bag kind of thing.
So that the corners of it would not get dog-eared.
So spine went to the area that would take the impact.
And you know, and it would be placed at a position
with protection of other books around it.
And then it would be carefully put in the locker.
And then when I would highlight important texts within that,
I was very careful with my highlight.
You had to have nice neat edges.
If you're highlighting a sentence, you had to highlight an entire sentence.
You couldn't highlight part sentences.
And there was a consistent color of yellow applied.
No other colors allowed.
I'm surprised you're even touching the highlighter.
Jason has his hand up.
Yes, Jason.
Can we pause for a second?
You've amassed like 40 questions at this point.
I haven't even got to my merchandise yet, my paraphernalia.
I know.
And that's why I want to try to get these done in order so we don't have to be referencing
back and forth too much. For your lockers, did you have the built-in locks or did you provide your own lock?
Brought my own lock, combination.
The little spinny one?
Yep, yep. I was breaking a safe every time I went into it.
And I didn't trust anybody, so that was getting locked every opportunity.
Yeah, I mean that.
Well, they might have wanted to get your economics book, highly prized.
Economics book, I don't even need to touch on that. That's just obviously.
On brand.
You said contact your books I assume you mean like contact paper like to protect the covers.
A transparent plastic it's like that really kind of stick yes to come on so I love wallpaper for your books.
Because we did we did you know like a like a paper grocery bag we always did those are you like.
Get it all flat and then you actually liked doing that that was quite fun because then you could decorate them I like that.
No you don't books are not for decorating.
My mum was unstoppable at contacting I just remember watching her thinking I could never do this and I'm grateful.
How do you know what book it was that or it was clear contact.
The only contact I would allow was clear.
Cuz there was some kids who get like design contact it was actually.
College stuff no I'm having none of that I want clear I want to see the book as the author intended but I want the protection.
I have another question. That would have been defacing the economy. About books in general.
Did you all have to purchase your books or were these books loaned to you at which point you gave
them back at the end of the year? Purchased.
Okay. See, we're clearly in different time periods here because the fact that you're talking about
carrying textbooks around in high school, Andrew, is funny. And I'm not having a go at you about
books and stuff. It's not like we're walking around with iPads or chips in our head or something.
there were textbooks but we never got our hands on them. They bought a limited number
and then illegally photocopied them and kind of gave things out as in-school readers. And I have
this very vivid memory of seeing a, I think it was a year nine or ten level mandatory history book
series called Retroactive. And the front cover was like a screenshot or freeze frame from Gladiator
with Russell Crowe like running upstairs with a torch and I'm like okay retroactive photocopied
cover with Russell Crowe this is history. Wow so you just got like a four like a ream of paper
stapled together handed to you instead of an actual book. Yeah but it was like in stages so
it was like every week you get chapter one chapter two. Yeah it was a nightmare of photocopying for
the teachers and we're like, wow, this is a fun spread out illegal activity.
You know how much toner that takes? That's where E. Offy comes in handy,
right? Because you're going to refill that toner.
Officeworks, pure fun.
Just to finish off your original question, Martin, I'll say the books and the management
of the books, the locker, that was the highlight of my high school career. I actually
really disliked high school. In terms of the merch, we got given this rugby jacket for like,
rugby jumper thing for levers and it had like it didn't even I don't even think it had everybody's
names on the back like they do now I feel like it just had a like levers you know there on the
on the chest and that was about it um and our school our school didn't even play rugby so
why'd they give us a rugby jumper I didn't understand that either what is levers that
that year is graduating oh got it it's kind of the name they give it here uh so yeah I got given
that stupid thing. And a nickname, the nickname I remember, I don't even like, I hated it. It was
like a bullying nickname, but I kind of grew to love it. I was called White Puff.
White Puff? Is that a reference to your complexion or were you some sort of serial
enthusiast? It was a reference to my complexion. And then also when I played basketball,
it was something about me being a bit soft. And so instead of, even though I was tall and big,
I would prefer to shoot three point shots than go inside and like.
Rough people up.
Rough people up, which I think if anybody watches the game basketball, I know I was just ahead of my time because that's the way it's gone these days.
That's the way the game is played.
Isn't that a strategic thing to do?
You're trying to get more points by doing.
Exactly.
And that's on soft, that's strategic.
Thank you, Martin Moneyball Feld.
You've just figured it out.
See, you and me, we use our brains in the game.
But that year.
Hands across Australia.
It's happening.
In that era it was about just you know punching and grabbing and roughing people up.
Yeah.
I didn't like that.
Exactly so I was a bit of a soft soft puff puff sort of thing so I became white puff.
You guys have come up with great stuff I didn't I didn't have a whole heap of stuff to mention I was just prompted because I found something in my wardrobe when I was washing some old stuff and I thought I'm gonna ask if you guys have anything so I actually have a piece of senior year paraphernalia that I've prepared from earlier.
- Oh my goodness.
- You know in Mean Girls when she says,
stop trying to make fetch happen, you know that thing?
She keeps saying fetch like it's a word for cool.
But she's like, stop trying to make fetch happen.
Fetch is not gonna happen.
I never had a nickname at school, right?
I was just always Martin.
And I think that was just attributed
to my general formality.
It was like, Martin has entered the room.
Martin is leaving the room.
Thank goodness he stopped talking.
But I thought, okay, well,
we had to put something on our senior jumpers.
And I wasn't obsessed with making this happen.
but I felt like it was kind of verging on that.
So I had, and the listeners can see this in the show notes,
seniors 08/09, Feldmeister.
(laughing)
- Feldmeister.
(laughing)
What were you supposed to do with this jumper?
- Well, we all wore them to school.
So you'd walk around with your chosen name on your front
and it's actually a hoodie.
So that's it there.
I would wear this every day to school.
But the funny thing, you know, just because of the attire or the uniform, mostly boys.
I mean, I think girls could wear shorts if they wanted to, but we'd be there in winter wearing this hooded jumper with shorts.
So did Feldmeister take off?
Did it? Did people start using it?
I think they thought it was funny or they'd kind of like roll their eyes or chuckle at it.
But it was never something where people actually addressed me that way.
It sounds like Martin had the happiest high school experience though.
Jason and I both need a counseling session after.
Oh, I'm yeah, I'm all in my own head now at this point.
Well, I'm sorry. I really should have thought about my co-hosts because, yeah, I really enjoyed high school.
So sorry about that.
No, I just want to go and read my economics books now.
See, at our school, we were just around the corner, just up the road from this place, which is loved by anyone in Wollongong.
There are two different branches and one of them is in Fig Tree where my high school was.
It's called Chico's.
It's like a local chicken shop with the biggest schnitzel burgers that you can buy.
A schnitzel burger?
A schnitzel burger?
Yeah. Is that not a thing in the US?
Can you describe like it's a sausage?
So it's chicken schnitzel on a burger with other accoutrement.
A schnitzel is like a crumbed chicken breast that's been flattened.
Oh, sorry.
And cheese on top usually.
Okay, gotcha.
Yep.
Yep.
And this particular-
Schnitty.
It's a schnitty.
... is now deviating.
Schnitty.
Well, I knew there was far too many syllables in there for it to be a thing, so I knew that
it was going to get cut down any minute.
Who's got time to say schnitzel?
Jeez.
Yeah, just a schnitty.
Or, as most people say in Australia, snitty, which is incorrect, but let's move on.
So it's like, "Oh, the schnitty, the 750 schnitty."
No, it's a schnitty because it's a schnitzel.
S-C-H-N, not S-N.
They even write it S-N-I-T-T-Y.
What's a snitty, anyway?
So Chico's was the destination for people who would wag from school and then come back.
- Oh, waggers.
- Right?
And people would, I'm sure teachers just saw people walking with like family chips.
Like that's not at the canteen.
You can't buy that.
They're like, oh, we're just back from, just wagging makes sense to you, Jason.
I think I've heard playing hooky on The Simpsons.
Is that what people say?
I think there's a distinction there.
I think wagging in your example there is to be at school,
leave during lunch or something and then come back.
Whereas hooky would be like, I would put that more closely to just,
I'm out for the day.
Bye.
I'm not even going to go at all.
Coming back is kind of optional in the wagging world.
You might not come back.
I was a big wagger.
I wagged constantly I'm wagon.
Get science or something in the afternoon.
Most days are wag days.
What did you do when you're working Jason.
Well I mean it's a little bit of a personal question but the goal was to be away from the school grounds that was the that was the main goal what was being done didn't really matter it was more the fact that you were.
In said wag scenario versus being in the school environment
Right, but you weren't having shitties. That's the Sun you weren't having shitties. That's for sure
I would have if they had existed. I remember leaving school and going to watch office space at the movie theater
That was genius best day of my life right there. I think we I think we watched it twice in a row
Man, I'm jealous of that day. Yeah, that was a great day
We left and said, you know what? Let's go get lunch got lunch went to the movies
It was one of those movie theaters where during the day they were super cheap. So it was like
$3 or something because no one's going to the movies on a weekday at noon
And we saw office space and then immediately went
And walked out and then walked back in and watched it again
So just hearing this it sounds like Jason you were actually a teenager where I don't think I ever was a teenager
I think I just skipped that.
You might have.
I remember sitting down in a free period, like a study period.
People use that to leave, but I was sitting there reading a summarized, like 30-page,
personally written version of a Trotsky textbook for an interview assessment that I had.
People are off getting Chico's Chips and I'm there learning about Trotsky.
Which one of us is pursuing a PhD right now?
Let me just ask that question.
Yeah, but which one of us is chasing self-punishment?
Hey, I'm just saying that the two paths seem to be aligning pretty nicely.
Well, that's kind of a decide. But anyway, nerd alert. That's what I'm saying.
Yeah, I downloaded the Xbox app on my phone and then had to do this, the wonderful authentication
process where it says 27. And then on your phone, it pops up, which one of these three
numbers is 27 you're like it's probably 27 thanks like okay so weird but yep.
You went through the whole process just to see a picture of Andrew's car and a like.
Yep that was it I saw that yeah and then I said all right cool and then I immediately went to go buy an Xbox because I felt left out.
And is that a joke surprisingly I could have bought one I had it in the cart I don't know why that was even legal to do but yeah it was in the cart and it was like I don't need that why am I I'm literally buying this because they added me to a freaking chat that has nothing to do with anything and that immediately made me go and almost impulse buy an Xbox I don't need.
Which one, an S or an X?
An X, yeah, it was a series X.
Of course you did.
It let me put it in the cart and everything.
I was like, "Oh, shoot, all right."
And then I abandoned the cart.
So I hope that helped somebody else out there.
But I have to ask, just because I think we've kind of meandered into one of our bullet points,
which is labeled Xbox Corn with exclamation marks in green.
Thank you, Andrew Basketball.
You're welcome.
Do you actually have any Xbox stuff at home, Jason?
Because you had a high gamers score and you had this whole history.
I saw your kind of profile there,
or is it just that you don't have the newest generation
and you've stuck with the PS?
- I was 100% Xbox for the last quite number of years
before I, the thing that happened was
new gen consoles came out and it was Xbox Series X and PS5.
My plan was to get both, none were available forever.
I happened to get a PS5,
continued trying to get an Xbox,
'cause I have a Xbox One X,
so the previous top one or whatever.
And there was a thing where if you had one of those,
you had like a special thing in there
where you could like get into a queue
to order one of the new ones.
And it was like, you could only order it
through the actual console.
There was no other way to do it
'cause they were trying to fight bots
from going and just like sniping all of the units
from everybody else.
Never happened. I got the PS5. I started playing everything on the PS5.
I was like, well, I guess I'm a PS5 person now.
Yeah. I don't know. I don't really know any people, even gamer types,
who are 100% wedded to a console brand.
It's really just a game or set of games that they like.
Is that your experience?
Yeah, pretty much. The only problem I ever have is that I have a really hard
time going back and forth between the controllers.
So I get really like connected to the PS5 controller and I know where everything is, how everything works and functions.
And then I go to an X, I pick up an Xbox controller and it's just like, I don't even have hands anymore.
Yeah, I kind of meandered off course.
Sorry. I think, Andrew, you wanted to talk about managing your family, which you've said is hell.
Well, do you not like your family?
Depends on the day.
Talk about bullet point out of context.
Do you wanna clarify that at all Andrew or you wanna just let that stand.
I don't wanna spend a lot of time on this but basically Xbox it's really fun and you
plug it in and set up a profile for myself and you do realize pretty quickly that this
thing's designed to be profilized everybody needs to have their own space.
So you say so so I set that up and so quickly you thrust from cool Xbox world like hey game attacks and little profile pictures and to.
You need an outlook.com account and you need to authenticate with Microsoft and just that is jarring you go from this fun cool hip kind of dudes to suddenly.
Corporate IT speaking you need to have an email account and you need to two-factor authenticate that account and then you need to go manage and tell what your children can do and can't do and it's really complicated and does it cross over with Microsoft family safety versus Xbox family and the site.
doesn't my head in coming from the man who a very short time ago spoke about his economics textbook being contacted I'm not sure how you not enjoying this corporate it bent.
How this would have been for you.
Corporate is fine when you're expecting corporate it but when you're in Xbox game a world I want at least a skin of Xbox over the top of it but it literally pops you out at one point into that little pop up.
Microsoft white box with the spinning blue dots right you know the one and then suddenly it's like login to your Microsoft account and they say enter the key into the email you got will do you mean my email is the.
Is the originator or the kids email is the thing but the kid doesn't have a Microsoft account I don't really want to set one up he has an iCloud account CD I'll try using the iCloud email just see what happens and you type in the like into the password.
He doesn't have a password because you don't we does but it's high clouds password not Microsoft's password
So what am I meant to do here? So ultimately you end up screw it. I'll just have to create another email address
that's just for this Xbox account and
So I have to save in one password eyes a whole nother login
It's just it's just so frustrating. So already I've got a six-year-old kid and he's got like three email addresses
But just think how well he's gonna be set up for LinkedIn when he has that sweet outlook calm 100%
He's gonna make the transition from meeting master chief to digital transformation manager and a heart that's gonna be just seamless
Seamless it's just so depressing and this I think is the problem when you have these big gigantic
Corporations and they want everything to be streamlined into one
Homogeneous system ideally Xbox would be an entirely different company, right?
And they just have their own authentication system and you do that and it would be fine
And then I have the Microsoft stuff somewhere else, but they try and weave in the Microsoft with the Xbox
It's like no, no, it's not appropriate and people say the Xbox interface as well that people have talked about that being good
I don't know what they're on. I think that Xbox interface is terrible. I can never quite figure out where I am
spatially, like what level am I at?
- It actually reminds me a bit of the Metro interface.
Do you remember from Windows Phone?
- Yes, but a worse version of it.
- And it kind of shuffles the most recent things to the top.
I'm okay with it because I get,
all right, I'm in this Xbox world
and it doesn't feel entirely like Windows,
but there's some connection.
But yeah, if you're not used to it,
it makes sense, you wouldn't like it.
- Yeah, I'm not loving it.
I'm not loving it.
And then I went and created old Gamertag for Hannah.
I spent a whole bunch of time designing a perfect avatar,
and then I accidentally pushed B not Y or something,
whatever the button was.
And do you think it prompted me like,
oh, you're about to leave the app,
you may want to save this?
No, it just leaves the app.
You go back in and suddenly it's back to default.
(upbeat music)
- You launched Food Chat today on the Discord,
and you've got stuff about food.
- I did, Gabby asked for it and I said, here you go,
delivered on a silver platter,
because there has been times where I wanted to post food or beverage things
and thought, "Where does this go?
Does it go in I made this?
Hmm, kind of, sort of.
Does it go in general?
Hmm, I feel like now I'm just shoving food Instagrams down people's throats.
People don't want that."
- Yeah.
- This should be in a different place so people can completely ignore it if they want.
So, yeah, food.
I forget what it's called.
What's it called?
Food chat.
- Food chat.
- So if you have food or beverage related items, toss them in there.
- So what did you have to say about food, Jason?
and something about perfection.
- We had a household discussion the other day
that I thought was interesting around the idea
of perfect foods and how it seems like
when we were making our lists of what we perceive
to be perfect foods, I don't wanna say all,
but close to all of them were hand-based foods.
And I thought that was interesting.
And then after I thought about it, it seems like,
well, yeah, of course they are,
because that's the most generally easily convenient thing
you have is your hands to be able to eat.
So I had a list of what I think
are my top three perfect foods,
and I wanted to know what each of you had
for a top three list of what your perfect foods are.
And when I say perfect food,
there's loose rules around that.
Not, it's not a tight box you're gonna live in,
but it's mostly, when I say perfect,
It is for you, this food accomplishes everything for you
with the least amount of things involved,
if that makes sense, right?
Where it's not my perfect meal is a 47 course,
what, like, I don't care about.
I'll give you my three.
I'm not gonna put these in a ranked order by any means,
but just to give you an idea of what I'm thinking.
So perfect foods, all of which are hand foods,
are number one, sushi, number two, pizza,
and number three, burritos.
All hand foods, all mostly self-contained items
that are easy to eat, delicious,
and just make you feel good.
- Not in any particular order, but for me, like you,
Pizza kills it.
Pizza is fantastic.
Just the fact that it's so versatile.
We haven't really thought about this enough.
On top of that, which I actually had for lunch today,
so it's at front of mind,
I don't have it often enough.
The gyros or gyros.
- Hand food, yep.
- Hand food again.
And just the fact that you can stuff it with lamb
or chicken, or it can be vegetarian.
It can have halloumi or feta, everything less.
The bread is great.
So that's great.
Third one, okay, this is very difficult.
This is a very, very obscure thing, but it's one of the greatest things I've had in my
life.
We have it locally at an Italian restaurant called Centro, or Centro, and it's called
Panna Fritto, and it's essentially fried Italian bread, which is covered in flakes of salt
that you dip in vinegar and olive oil.
And that is one of the greatest pleasures I've ever experienced at a table.
That sounded weird, and I'm sorry.
But you know what I mean.
Fried Italian bread.
Interesting.
Pan a fritto.
With like the big, like, finishing salt, I assume.
It's like that kind of flaky...
Yeah, just flakes.
Like, just...
And then you wash it down with canotto, which is the best.
Okay, I think that's fair.
Although, can I say, just before Andrew says his list, it's interesting what you said,
Pizza is a hand food because it totally is for me.
But if Natasha were with us right now talking, she is a knife and fork with pizza person.
Oh, that's like true Italian style.
Very refined.
Hand pizza.
And slicing up the slice.
Okay, so the first one I'll agree with you guys, pizza.
It's just so versatile.
Wow, pizza across the board.
So versatile.
It's the king.
Yeah.
It's the best food.
The second one would be fish and chips.
Oh yeah.
Eating it on you got it you order it you eat it on the grass and you're you're getting attacked by seagulls the entire time just.
I want to have fourth option.
The seagulls are part of that though right like if you're not getting attacked by seagulls.
That's not the same on the list.
Yeah.
That's not the same.
And there's always that one tourist family that's throwing chips to the seagulls and making it worse for everyone.
Why don't they learn?
Piss me off.
And there's and then there's of the seagulls there's always one angry seagull that's like the boss.
And he comes right up and then if another seagull comes up he just turns around and goes.
That was a perfect impersonation and there's always one disease to see a girl which is a bit less fortunate than the others and I gets the sympathy chip in the mail tackle.
It looks a little bit zombie ish nearly that's he's got 34 hours max.
Clarification Andrew, battered or crumbed?
See it depends on the day.
Bat is bad, it's gotta be battered.
Be a battered ideally.
I don't even know if Americans know what we're talking about at this point, but it's really good.
Number three, people, regular listeners to the show know this answer already.
It's a donut kebab with a lot.
With or without a handshake?
That's like a seagull, but a person.
One prime plus reference for those out there.
Andrew might have shaken a hand of a kebab man who didn't ask for it.
It's a good story.
Anyway, kebabs.
Yeah, specifically the donut kebab.
And it has to be the lot.
So you get egg and cheese and all that.
And then it's sour cream and sweet chili sauce.
Tabouli?
You know, if they're fine.
You need tabouli.
Do you ask for onion?
Do you have a lot of onion in that thing?
No, I don't.
on you for hours afterwards. Yeah, I don't love onion. Like often when I get a burger,
I'll minus the onion. But usually with donut kebab, I'm usually had a few beers by that point
on most days, you don't really care. Just like a lot and whatever the lot, you know, it becomes.
That's it. I like your honesty here, Andrew. So you're basically admitting to the stereotype that
you order kebabs when your decision making skills have been compromised. Yep, yep, yep. And there's
some there's some, you know, there's a plate this I gotta give a shout out city kebabs in Perth.
Oh my goodness it's the CDS looking joint is right next to the parking garage it's lots of drunk people and about you know big big walkie great guys inside is that.
Hey you want to come back and then they have they've upgraded recently to like a microphone system because I realize people are so drunk so that they push a button.
54 54 and then if you if the person with number 54 ticket doesn't show up within like 15 seconds they get really angry and they be like they might yell it out and I'm one more time and then they just like.
Yeah it's his own problem at that point and then move on number 55.
And I'm guessing you walk in you walk into this cacophony you walk into this cacophony super polite well-dressed. It's like hello good, sir
I'd like to water my doner kebab and then you follow the rules and you're there within the specified period like I'm scared
It's like the soup Nazi. Of course. You're it's like super Nazi. Yeah. Yeah, it really is. I'm like
But this kebabs are really good
so I
bet myself a thousand dollars that one of you would have picked a meat pie and
neither
It's a good point because meat poise boys.
Why don't you just say meat poise?
Where did you just transition to?
I just travelled to Queensland.
I don't know what people look my Bob cutter moment.
Meat poise, meat pies can be fantastic or they can be utter filth.
So a properly made decent one.
Yeah.
I'm angry at myself.
Okay.
I'm deleting.
I'm deleting pizza.
No, I'm not going to delete pizza.
I'm going to delete fish and chips.
- Don't do something you're going to regret.
- No, I'm going to delete fish and chips,
deleting fish and chips.
- Oh, please.
- And I'm getting a meat pie.
Maybe even a steak and kidney.
- Okay, Andrew, I need to intervene at this point
because can you or would you order chicken salt
on a meat pie?
- No, never.
- No, but you would with fish and chips, wouldn't you?
And you're just going to exclude chicken salt
from the whole equation?
- Chicken salt is good.
It is special.
It's everyone's favorite radioactive yellow seasoning.
- Goodness.
- That may or may not taste like chicken.
- Yeah, it doesn't taste anything like chicken.
- No, it doesn't, but it's great.
And Carl Barron, Australian comedian,
put it well when he said that in class,
he asked which person decides which chickens
become roast chickens and which ones become chicken salt.
It's an existential question.
- It's a bit like, I think the,
like we talked about the seagulls earlier,
the manky seagull,
I think that's the sort of the chicken equivalent.
He's going to the one that's going to become the salt.
So manky chickens, watch out.
Really off putting.
It's really off putting.
This is not how Jason wanted it to go.
No, I don't think America really has manky chickens and chicken salt at all.
Really.
I think they just have hot dogs.
I don't know what chicken salt is.
I assume it's a seasoning of some kind.
I envision it's what's put on the chicken in a biscuit.
crackers would be chicken salt where it's like you said it's chicken so I'm
gonna like sort of make myself believe that it tastes like chicken but it
really doesn't. It does have that quality of when you have a savory biscuit or
snack that is sold as tasting like chicken but it doesn't really that's the
category it's in and I would probably say that normal salt like really really
good salt is kind of better I suppose but there's something special or fun
about chicken salt. I mean you get to say chicken salt that's gotta be part of it.
Exactly. And a bit of vinegar in like the spray bottle. Yeah I don't do that to
chips I'm sorry. Yeah I'm not a huge fan but I'll do it occasionally. Just make
some soggy. But you can't now because you've evicted them from the list.
Actually you know who I do judge? Sorry there is some minor judgment here. If you
do this to your own chips that's fine because I've seen friends and even
colleagues do this. If you put tomato sauce across your own chips, fair enough if you like that,
but don't presume others do on a shared family pack. No, sauce on the side.
Sauce on the side, good. You don't obliterate everyone's chips with soggy tomato sauce/ketchup.
If it's gravy, then it's all over. Yeah, I suppose, but you're still being presumptuous.
Chips and gravy, I mean, you just got to pour that all over the place. All over those chips.
So we all like pizza, right?
Sounds like pizza is a top contender.
So now I need everyone to submit their list of three perfect foods.
Okay, how are they going to submit that in the new food chat discord?
Well, there's the new food chat on discord or there's @hemisphericpod on Twitter,
@hemisphericviews on micro.blog, but discord's the most fun place.
Yeah, we need more people on discord, more people.
I feel like there's some listeners out there that aren't that are listening religiously listening, but aren't getting into the discord
Just give it a go except if you're a spam salesperson who calls me my friend every three seconds. Please don't do that
I don't have to wait
I don't know how I'm gonna get this down to 45 minutes. I don't like my odds.
I think you're gonna do just fine. No more than 48.
