*music*
So moving to you now Jason, I've got a bunch of questions
Clarice the dog cow very impressed. Is that Lego and did you make it yourself?
Yes, and yes, it is Lego. I did make it myself and it was not a
trivial
thing to find
So wait, let me back up. I knew I wanted to do
Clarus out of Lego
So I got the Clarus like the original artwork
Brought it into you know, whatever pixel meter or whatever cut it all up into one by one cubes
So just giant pixels so I can map those to Lego
Then found how big you could get Lego backing boards got one of those
Then went to the Lego store and like a crazy person asked for very specific
numbers of white one by one pieces and black one by one pieces to which they looked at me like I was actually insane and
Then they didn't have them they didn't have enough so then I had to go on to some like back alley Lego
exchange
Order all these Lego pieces to then finally build this thing
And then it was done. I love how European you sound when you say that name Lego
It's like you're from Denmark and we're just like plebs from the south
Lego, you know, you got your Lego Clarus up on the wall. Yes. I have my Lego
so yeah, that's the story of
Clarus the beautiful and my wife actually pointed out she's like why didn't you just get like
Because there's obviously giant chunks of like single color. Like why didn't you just get giant white pieces and I was like
"That's actually a good point. I probably could have done that."
But in my head, it was like I wanted it to be pixel art.
So I wanted every Lego to be separate.
When you put it on the wall, sorry, did you exclaim "moof"?
No. Well, I don't remember if I did or not, but I do say that in my head often.
That probably says a lot.
And there's no dithering there, is there?
There's no grey pieces between the white and the black?
Black? No, it's just all, uh, all black and, and white pieces.
Okay. Wow. Um, I have more questions. Sorry, Andrew, I'm going to cut in here.
I am astonished that there is a curved display.
Tell us about that. It's the best kind of display you'll ever use.
So this is a 38 inch ultra wide curved screen.
I don't remember. There's like, there's something they call,
I think it's like an R value or something like that.
This one is the best R value there is, but yeah, ultra wide monitor can't ever go
back.
Dual monitors is the worst.
Having a bezel in the middle makes me want to die.
So no, always ultra wide, always forever.
And it comes with, it comes with a telescope mounted on the back.
That is, it does look like a little mini telescope, doesn't it?
That's actually my, uh, webcam quote unquote.
It's like the most overkill.
It's a, uh, it's a Logitech PTZ.
It's for a conference room.
I knew it.
I saw those at my university.
Does it turn automatically the face here?
It turns automatically.
It does all kinds of fancy dancing.
When you turn it on, it's got like a crazy Carl Zeiss HD 1080 P 10 X optical zoom.
It's stupid.
It's like not a webcam, but I had it.
So it was like, it's my webcam now.
When I was at uni, they refurbished rooms and put in a new building and they installed these
and no one was used to them and we were sitting in these new lecture theatres
and if it was more of a tutorial set up and you had to put your hand up,
100% people just jumped because these cameras sprung into action
and just zoomed in on you and you could see yourself on the screen.
So it's like being in an Orwellian Big Brother thing, but you've chosen to put it on your desk.
Yes, yes I did.
It's better than the built-in eyesight camera that I'm rocking with this iMac
Definitely piece of junk Wow okay. I have another question that I'll let Andrew jump in I'm interested in your
Because I know Andrew had some sort of desk pad
Thing happening, but yours looks like a Samsung wallpaper. Why is that? Oh?
No, does it really no, but I like it no no no I like it
It's like it's the same way that I have a Samsung display, and it sort of kills me
But I really like the screen. So what inspired the color choice? I
Don't know. I just liked bright colored things and so I yeah
It was like one of those random online purchases was like giant mouse pad for 9.99 or whatever
So there it was there was really no more thought put into it than that. It just looked like a cool
Thing to have on my desk it does and look don't be ashamed and don't think it's bad now because 100% I
Downloaded something looked exactly like that years ago as a wallpaper for my phone and then discovered that they were Samsung wallpapers and I went
Well, maybe they just came up with something that was aesthetically pleasing for once so go with it. I think it's great
I will be burning it directly after this, but thank you. Yeah shit. Sorry
Andrew any questions? I haven't yeah, I have a number of questions
Firstly more to the architecture of the building itself
Above Clarice dog cow we have like a panel that it looks like a slight switch
But it seems just a panel and I presume is too high for a light switch and you have one on the other side as
Well, what what's going on there?
so the whole office has
wiring
Conduit in the walls so that you could run various things to various places without having like cords go up the wall
So if I ever want to put like like if you wanted to put speakers up in the corner
You can just have all the wiring go through the wall and come out there
Or if you needed a cat5 up there or whatever
So it's just a way to have like you can see down on the bottom left
There's a bunch of paneling and all around the whole house. There's just like
For later kind of thing. I could run stuff at a future time. That's forward-thinking
Okay, and then I noticed moving around the wall you have your certificates and your shelf of
iPhones which looks cool but you also seem to have what appears to be a giant
trackpad mounted on the wall blue tech oh the white thing yeah oh that's
actually do you remember the old Airport Express's that looked like a Mac mini
they were plastic and white it's the lid off of one of those it was like a third
Gen
Before they became the big tall towers. I like the extreme
Yeah, her airport Airport extreme I had one that was the time machine backup thing as well
I heard that the hard drive time capsule time capsule. Yes. This is just the top lid off of one of those
Did you find it that way or did you do it that way to mount it on the wall?
No, I ripped it off the top of it after it finally died
Okay, that's it. Now. I'm gonna zoom in a little bit more on your desk. You have your computer
Which the little one Mac mini to the left of that you have like a white cylinder
Is that like is is it a scented candle it's lotion
Okay, so this is the
Inspire
Mac
Candle number two. It is a candle. I had something like that. This was
this was a stupid stunt put on by
who did this? Oh, 12 South. They make like Mac accessories and stuff. And their whole
thing was they were going to make a candle that smelled like when you open up a new Mac,
that smell that it has. It's total bullshit. It doesn't smell like that at all. But it
was just like the stupidity of this like, apply inspired candle that smells like a Mac.
It was just like too stupid not to buy so that's all that is but it doesn't smell like
a Mac at all.
It's funny because I had one of those, Natasha got it for me but they made it just look like
a candle, totally different, like a brown glass jar.
Oh no, yeah this is number two.
Oh you got the upgrade.
That's from Johnny Ives' White Room.
It smells good, like it's not a bad smell it's just like it doesn't smell like a Mac
so that was a little disappointing.
I kind of like secretly hoped that they'd somehow figured that out, but they did not.
Okay.
Question for you on the shelving.
You have to choose one.
What is your favorite product on the wall?
Um, wow.
I have to choose one.
Just one.
Everything perishes in a fire, but one.
What happens?
Probably the Palm Pre.
Wow.
With MagSafe way before there was MagSafe charging.
Wow.
They called it the Touchstone and it was the best thing ever made.
It's literally what MagSafe is on the iPhone 12, but back then.
Looks pretty cool.
Magnets on, charges your phone.
So yeah, probably that.
I think it's the most interesting device up here.
Very nostalgic for you.
Or maybe this Pentium 3 processor.
Any other questions for him, Andrew?
On your desk.
Yes.
Are those like giant spotlights mounted under your monitor?
Close.
They're more akin to, uh, Martin's rear view mirrors.
Those are speakers.
Really?
Yes.
Those are the, uh, Razor something, Chroma, something or other.
They look cool.
Although they sound cool.
They do.
Yeah.
They sound pretty good.
They're not like, I think they're a little light on the low end, but
for being in this office with my wife's desk is behind me.
So to have like big boomy stereo is not really ideal, which is why I have the
keyboard I have now because I used to have, well, I have here on the desk is
big K2, but once we moved into the same office together, um, that quickly became
not okay.
And you're a trackpad God, not a mouser.
No, I,
I really like the Magic Trackpad.
I use the mouse every once in a while, but mostly the giant trackpad.
It just works for everything.
You got gestures and I just-- all mice piss me off.
Every single Logitech mouse is-- they have some good mice,
but for whatever reason, the connectivity is just trash.
And their mouse works perfectly fine 100% of the time.
I don't know why no one else can figure it out, but there you go.
I don't know about you two, but after having discussed all three desks, my preferences
for setup are always teetering on the brink anyway.
"Oh, it could be this.
It could be that."
Like, just your trackpad statement then, Jason.
I was a trackpad guy for years, and now I use that with the iPad and I use this Lodgy
mouse here.
Everything could be torn down by next week.
I don't know about you two, but now I'm incredibly self-conscious.
The dock's in the wrong place.
It shouldn't be hidden.
Oh, God.
This has been treacherous.
Enjoyable but treacherous.
I don't know what to do.
Tune in next week and we'll show you Martin's new setup.
