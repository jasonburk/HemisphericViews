(upbeat music)
- Andrew, I've been very considerate about you today
'cause you know how I've edited last couple.
- Yeah.
- You know, you were in Darwin and stuff.
I know that you're editing this one.
So I've made an adjustment to the overall decor
and equipment of this here study.
Normally, if you ever heard a clunk,
it's when I'm putting my glass down on this ceramic coaster
that my aunt gave me, right?
- Yeah.
- What I've done is I've brought the felt coasters
that match the felt thing on the wall.
- The felt coaster?
- Yes, exactly.
So that there's a dampened,
- Oh.
- Oh.
- Ffff, ffff, as I put it down.
- Noise suppression, very good.
- Don't say that I don't think of you, Andrew.
- I want one of those.
- Can that be like a gift to the other Hemisphere Reviews hosts?
- From who?
From Martin?
- From Martin, yeah.
He just buys another couple and ships them direct to us.
- What, like singular felt coasters?
- Yeah.
- I'll talk to Natasha because she got them.
I'll have to arrange something.
- Look, I've got this coaster.
- Is that wood?
- Can you start that thing?
Yeah.
- It's, and it's got cork on the top.
It's, I don't know if you guys have ever heard of Ugmonk?
- Yes.
- You've shown us before, I think.
- Oh, oh, fine.
(laughing)
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Sorry, man.
- I'm not shutting you down.
- Forget about it.
- I'm just saying it seems familiar.
God, so defensive.
Let's take a little screenshot here, come on.
- I think it was episode 22 you mentioned this device.
- All right, that's Coaster Corner.
(upbeat music)
Kick us off, Jason.
I think you bought something rather ultra, is that right?
- Yeah, is that where we're starting?
Are we starting, are we not saving the best for last?
We're saving the best for first, hell yeah.
- You put it first in the topic pool.
- Oh, is that how this works?
Oh, okay.
My ultra short review.
So if you're ready, I would like to lay this on you.
This was gonna be a blog post,
but I thought if I just talk about it,
then I don't have to actually type.
Job done.
So first of all,
I am considering the Apple Watch Ultra
to be my personal series zero.
What do I mean by that?
This is the watch that I've wanted since Series Zero.
So I have had not every watch, but most of them over time.
I had the first one, let's just say that.
I had the Series Zero before there was even Series.
I think it was just the Apple Watch back then.
And it was great, but this is like the Series Zero moment,
or maybe you can consider it a reset.
So here are my reasons why.
I love the bigger size because it feels correct to me.
For my personal view, it is like the size
I want the watch to be.
It feels great.
Second point, the orange, come on.
Like, as if you needed anything else.
We've got orange, not only on the action button,
which is new, but on the crown as well.
Double orange.
- And for people in the Southern Hemisphere,
that that is orange that he's referring to.
Thank you for the translation, live translation.
I was lost for a while, so I'm glad you stepped in there Andrew, thank you.
So I hope it stays that color forever and this model just stays orange forever until
the very end.
So thank you for that.
The screen is what I would consider usable for day to day activities.
What do I mean by that?
I had the 40, well, I think it was 40, then it was 42,
then it was 44, same size watch,
but just the screen kind of kept bulging out
towards the edge.
You could do stuff on it.
It was great for the occasional,
maybe you need to do a quick reply to something
or you just need to check some notifications.
This now feels like I can do things on it
to where I don't automatically have to grab for my phone.
It's like, I can just do it on the watch
and it feels fine.
That's the first time I felt that way.
Speaking of the screen, the flat screen,
oh, thank you, love it, it's the best.
I know a lot of people love the curvy edges.
I think the curvy edges look nice,
but the big flat, love it.
All of my bands, since the very beginning, still work.
- That's amazing.
- This is probably one of the craziest things
about the Apple Watch,
is the fact that it's been seven years, I think,
maybe eight.
- Since it was released.
- Since it was released.
- So it announced 2014, yeah.
- And it's, all the bands still work.
I would not have expected that.
I thought for sure somewhere midway through,
there's gonna be a band change,
everybody's gonna freak out.
It stands to reason it could still happen,
but I love the fact that there has been
somewhere on the list of, you know,
must haves when they're making these things.
says must work with every band ever made. I just think that's really great. So the very first band,
the stainless link, because the bands are not cheap either, right? Like they're an investment.
They are not by any stretch cheap. But yeah, the very first stainless link, that was my very first
Apple Watch band, still works. And by the way, looks really good with the Ultra. So there you go.
I don't want to derail you too much here, but I reckon they've maintained that compatibility
because they've regarded it as a feature. Because if you think about any other watch
on the market, whether it's a smartwatch or not a smartwatch, do any other brands or watches
offer this kind of easy interchangeable set of bands within the size that you choose? Not really.
So to compromise that would actually probably compromise upgrades or further sales of the watch.
So it's, I think maybe an environmental choice.
It's consumer friendly.
I think it's just, they consider it a feature
that they want to maintain for as long as possible.
So yeah, I think that's great that you mentioned.
- It is a big upgrade issue, right?
'Cause if you have a ton of bands
and all of a sudden the new watch comes out,
but it doesn't work, you're gonna really be like,
I don't really wanna rebuy all my bands now.
So. - Yeah.
- And I think Apple knows that people will be motivated
as more of a fashion or personal style choice
rather than this is a computer on my wrist.
They know that it's different things to different people.
So I think it's awesome that all your old stuff works.
- Yeah, and so finishing, rounding out my ultra short review.
Now I'm gonna say one thing that I have no idea if it's true.
I did not research it.
So perfect for this show.
The Taptic Engine, I feel like is bigger
because like it is pronounced.
Like when you get some Taptic action going on,
It is like, it's there.
It's it.
- Like your bones are vibrating.
- Yeah, like you're not missing that.
And not in a bad way.
It's just like, it's substantial and feels like proper.
And then of course, battery life, elephant in the room.
Like it's just, I'm still trying to get used to it
in that for seven years or whatever,
it's always been wear Apple watch during day,
put on charger at night, wear Apple watch during day,
put it watch, you know, that was just like the cycle.
If you wanted to do sleep,
you either had to do this like dance between two watches
or do this thing where every hour or so,
you're like, let me get a quick 15 minutes of charge
on there and then like put it back on
and you're just doing that dance back and forth.
Now it's like multiple days, super comfortably,
not an issue.
I wear it all day every night now,
or all day and all night for generally two
or more days in a row before I have to charge it.
And the new charger charges super fast,
So not really an issue there.
Yeah, battery life is absolutely wonderful
and it's nice to not have to do the charge every time.
And finally, I will do the last final bit
of this in-depth review.
The sleep tracking and just the tracking in general,
I came from a Series 5,
so I didn't get Series 6 or Series 7,
so I skipped two generations to get to now.
And everything is, it seems more accurate.
I had a warning at one point that my
something or other was drastically different
for the last six days and like, spoiler,
six days ago was when I got the watch.
So it's just, it's amazing that it's more accurate now
in every respect.
And now I can get blood oxygen levels
and like, it's just all the health stuff I really like.
And I like being able to see all the sleep stuff now
that I was not able to see before.
I started getting alerts that my heart rate
was below like some threshold that was not good.
Never would have known that
'cause I never wore the damn thing at night.
So it's just cool that that's able to be a thing now
and there's this battery anxiety is slowly going away
and I really liked that.
So I could not be happier with this watch.
I absolutely love it.
If I had to, I would be fine I think keeping this
for multiple years like I did the Series 5.
And yeah, the only other thing I'll say is like,
of course there's this like, this is for extreme whatever.
It's like, if you like it, get it.
If you don't, don't buy it
because you're supposed to be an ultra marathoner.
Like that's idiotic.
I think all these arguments that I see online
are super dumb.
If the fact were that products were only meant
for the people to use them for those things,
so many things would never be purchased
because that's not how the world works.
So if you like it and it's like not too big for you
and you want better battery life
and you just like how it looks, go for it.
- It's like the Submariner watch
isn't just for Submariners.
You know, you can buy that if you never got on a boat.
- It is allowed, surprisingly.
Yeah, you're allowed to just buy things
because you like them.
It's weird, I know, but that's where we're at.
And if you want titanium, you gotta go with Ultra,
which was what scared me during the event
because they announced the series eight
and there was no titanium, which is my preferred material.
Then they said, "Ultra's titanium."
I was like, "Oh, okay, everything's fine."
So, Ultra, there you go.
Get out there.
- Andrew has a paper rectangle.
- The extreme.
Oh, hold on.
Card corner.
- Card corner.
I have a question.
A question I've noted down.
- Yeah.
- That's what you're meant to say.
Two questions.
- Two, sorry, Equator couldn't make it.
I have noticed just from screenshots of this watch that when you look at it, it seems like
you know how when you have the complications around the corner of a watch face, the four
points of the watch, it seems like there's a lot of wasted space in those corners.
Almost like the watch face could be bigger and it seems like there's just a lot of dead
area in the four corners of this watch.
Do you find that to be the case in reality, or is it just a thing that sort of jumps out
in photos?
I do not find that to be the case, no.
Especially with the, I forget what it's called, but there's a new watch face that came out
specifically with this one, and I think it has-
Wayfonda?
Yeah, that sounds right.
I think it has like eight complications on it.
It's insane.
It has so much information on one screen.
But no, I would say no.
I don't think there's wasted space.
Not that I could tell.
- Before we move on to the next topic,
'cause I know that we've got a lot to get through,
I wanted to make a little point about this watch,
because even though I'm not owning one,
I'm not planning to buy one,
I did have a look at one briefly
at the Apple Store when we were in Sydney the other day.
And it struck me that although this watch isn't for me,
not actually because of the size,
but because I'm not super fussed on the crown guard,
maybe I could get used to it,
it just felt disruptive.
But what I loved about this watch,
I kind of saw a point of this in John Gruber's review of it was that the way I look at it,
this could be if Apple's willing the moment that the Apple Watch could actually break
free and be its own thing, maybe the beginning of this, because you think about Steve Jobs
era, Apple was perfectly willing to cannibalize the iPod and any other kind of similar products
with the iPhone.
And look where that brought us.
We've got this unbelievable kind of app ecosystem and everyone's got a phone now.
the watch it's still tied to the phone. You can have a cellular one or kids or elderly
relatives on the supported one with their own number. But if we look at what Apple did
with the iPad recently, letting it break free with iPadOS and be less dependent on the upgrade
and software update cycles of the phone. Now that the Apple Watch Ultra is bigger and you
can do more with it and probably comfortably watch some small format video on it, I would
love to see Apple bravely, using that word courage, be courageous in letting the Apple Watch
be its own kind of wrist iPhone. Imagine buying an Apple Watch, never having to have it tied to a
phone, have a phone number attached to it, and that becomes your central device, whether it's
for authentication, all of your accounts, anything. Now I know that Apple probably doesn't really want
to do that because they see everything as revolving around the iPhone, but I don't know what you two
thing. I think that kind of holds the product back a bit. And the number of people who would
actually use the watch in this way would be so small compared to the number of people around
the world who prefer having a phone because they want the camera and everything. You could actually
let the watch be its own separate independent device and realize that kind of Dick Tracy future
that maybe you always wanted, Jason. Any kind of thoughts on that? The watch being its own thing?
- This is an iPad OS scenario for sure.
Specifically the Ultra, not just Series 8.
I would say Series 8 still sort of accessory
needs to be connected, but this does feel like
a bit of a fork in the road now of being able to
leave your phone incredibly comfortably behind.
You're always gonna have the issue of the camera,
which is always the thing, which ironically is
really what people get iPhones for anyways, for the camera.
So aside from the camera part,
I would have, I would feel so much better
leaving my phone behind with this
than I would have with my Series 5.
I would still feel like, ah, I'm missing stuff
and I'm not gonna be able to accomplish anything.
I do feel like this is a different category now,
I would say.
Ooh, can I do one negative?
I have one negative.
Well, one just thing, right?
So this is not gonna be a think piece, don't worry.
So remember when we started,
when the phones had what I call the screenshot incident,
where when you went to press the power button,
you'd start like doing screenshots.
- Ah, I still have that problem.
- That's sort of a thing with the Ultra
because for seven years, I've been accustomed
to putting one thumb on the one side of the watch
and then pushing the side button with my finger.
And so to try to do that on this,
there's now a button on the other side.
Fortunately for this though,
this is a bit of a retrain from muscle memory
because the watch is taller
and you have that nice like curve up part.
So you just move your thumb up a little bit
and you can still accomplish the same thing.
But for the first probably a week,
I kept pushing the action button at the same time
as the side button.
And I think the action button always gets priority
from what I can tell because when you try to hit both,
it always does whatever the action button is doing.
So there was that as a thing,
but I'm over it now and like, it's fine.
So it just reminded me of the screenshot thing
where you'd be like, you'd have 50 screenshots a day
'cause you're just trying to turn your phone off.
- So in classic Jason style to wrap this up,
what's your rating system for this thing?
- Oh, this thing is like 600 eyeballs.
(upbeat music)
- Well, now it's my turn for a brief review
And because I kind of lengthened Jason's ultra short review,
I'm gonna make mine very, very short.
Whatever's more ultra than ultra short.
I bought a new camera recently.
- A new camera?
- Yes, a new camera.
The Olympus OM-D EM10 Mark IV.
That's a mouthful.
- After reading that title, that's all we've got time for.
So let's move on.
(laughing)
- Wait, so- - I wanted to bring this up.
- What did you have before?
So I still have my old Canon 500D,
three different lenses with that.
That's a DSLR and that's generally
what I've been used to using over the years.
It was actually a gift from my parents years ago
and I've taken it traveling,
taken family shots with it, absolutely love it.
But chasing around a young child
and wanting the kind of dad cam thing happening,
I thought I should explore mirrorless.
I should have a look at this, something lighter.
And I had my eyes kind of set on Fuji and Sony
after checking out different reviews
and YouTube stuff online.
And the reason I wanted to bring up this brief review
was not so much just about the camera, which I love.
It was a review of going into a brick and mortar store
to talk to a human being
who will lead you down a different path.
And I explained what I wanted to him.
- Imagine Martin going into a brick and mortar store
and having a conversation about what he wanted.
(laughs)
- Absolutely.
Yeah, it's like the time I signed up for Southern Phone
because they sent me something in the mail.
How old am I?
Anyway, I just wanted to say,
I've bought most things online in recent years,
exception being maybe the Apple Watch,
which I've done for trade-ins,
but that's kind of predictable.
I want this, no worries, swap over.
Went into the camera shop, explained what I'd looked at,
and he said, "Actually, it sounds like what you want
is this Olympus camera, micro four third system,
has a beautiful," I'm holding it here,
pancake lens 14 to 42 millimeter, a bit more ergonomic. And yeah, it was just lovely to
actually be led down a different path by someone who knew what they were talking about. Yes,
Jason has his hand up. Can you please name drop the store? I'm curious about what this camera
store situation is in Australia. Is this a, I had to go to a Best Buy type of place or is it a
standalone camera store?
Great question. I actually wanted to go to a camera specific shop of which Wollongong has no
more. They're all dead. So I went to Miranda, which is in South Sydney. There's a large Westfield
shopping centre there. And the shop was called DigiDirect.
Yes, I know that.
And they were absolutely fantastic. They were really, really good. And you walk and you go,
these people know cameras because they have more than five things in the cabinet. And this guy
I really knew what he was talking about,
was comfortable in bringing out different lenses
and showing the different case and body designs.
So yeah, not a sponsor.
They haven't put me up to this or anything.
I just wanted to say,
go to a shop that specializes in the thing that you want.
- I bought this microphone gear from a DigiDirect.
- There you go.
They do have other stuff, but they're no cameras.
Anyway, my review is that it's an awesome camera.
My first foray into mirrorless.
My review is essentially five feet out of two.
I just made that up.
So it exceeds what I wanted and super light.
Thank you.
- Can I ask a question?
- No, no, I've got one question.
- You can ask a question.
There's a card.
- I've not been into cameras in a long time.
My last SLR was the Nikon D7000.
And I haven't moved past that.
it sits in the cupboard now. And it feels too old and it's got dust spots on the lens and I can't
get them off and that kind of thing. So it's basically dead to me. Would I like it? Would
I like a mirrorless camera? Like, is it really coming from a DSLR world? Are they good now?
Are these things really good? - They're the best. What Jason said,
they're the best. What I like about it so much is that we were just talking about going outdoors
without your phone, maybe just having an Apple watch. If you leave your phone and you don't have
your camera with you, when you have something this light with a lens, which is quite a good
all-rounder in this case, because it is a zoom pancake lens, you're essentially walking around
with something that can actually fit into a decent trouser or pants pocket. So without that mechanical
mirror system inside it, you've suddenly got a thinner body. It's more lightweight. The displays
that replace that old optical viewfinder are sharp and bright enough now that you can actually
get an impression of what you're shooting. And the thing that I hadn't really appreciated about
mirrorless cameras, which will be old news to a lot of people listening and to Jason on this call,
will be that if you're adjusting something like your shutter speed or your ISO or whatever,
you're actually seeing the feedback or the alterations of what you've just adjusted
through the viewfinder.
It's not some imaginary,
I have to remember what this setting would be like
to suit this situation.
So it's like live feedback,
the way that you would maybe drag up and down
on an iPhone's camera app.
So I think it's killer, it's brilliant.
- And they're fully interchangeable lenses, aren't they?
So if you were to do that,
can you still get dust on the sensor?
Like is that still the same sort of risks of that?
- You're still opening up the camera body,
but the benefit of this,
and if you look up online,
Some people say, "Oh, it's dead, don't do this."
But Micro Four Thirds, which Olympus, I think,
pioneered with Panasonic, I think they co-developed it,
has a large variety of different interchangeable lenses
'cause of that kind of system they introduced.
So I'm quite a fan of this Olympus system.
Don't have to go for that, but mirrorless in general,
I would give huge thumbs up.
- Two questions.
So you had a Canon system before,
and I know from personal experience,
switching systems is
Can be painful if you have a lot of glass already because the glass is really the important part
The camera is arguably the garbage part which can be replaced over and over and over the glass is always good
So you already had glass?
So I'm curious why you didn't go for another Canon mirrorless like the our series or something
It was that a thought or was it you didn't have enough stuff in the Canon world where you felt like you had to
State like you were locked in you could get a few a few
Lenses, but not enough to like not make you look somewhere else. Is that what happened? That's pretty much the answer
I did actually look at Canon first
I'm not like a die-hard Canon brand user
But I was happy to try to stay in order to maintain that compatibility
The only thing that really stopped me from going down the path of Canon was that none of the cameras that they offered
Were as light and as thin as what I wanted so you you're right
There are the are ones but they were still a little bit big heavier
Yeah
Or a bit too big and they do have things like I think it's the m50 which is closer to this one
What I wasn't so fussed on that about though was that it wasn't quite as light and thin as what this one was
The kit lens that this came with which I mentioned was 14 to 42 millimeter
Was just a nice size as well and from I think to my recollection
There was also heavy 4k video cropping on the Canon and I'm not going to use this all the time for video
That's not why I bought it, but I'd prefer just to have
You know a more regular or closer to normal format or aspect ratio
It's not an aspect ratio zoom level for the video
and as far as
going for a camera with different lenses,
I'm not gonna stop using the Canon.
Like I have the 50 millimeter kind of portrait lens with it.
I've got like a wide lens with it.
I still enjoy using it and I'll use it around the house
or with family nearby.
I don't mind using two different types of camera
depending on the situation
when I've got this one to just take with me easily
anywhere else.
And look, with the old one, I had it for so long.
We're talking about a DSLR that's over a decade old now.
That actually made it a bit easier because I hadn't been, you know,
frequently collecting and adding and upgrading in that interim.
It was essentially easy to just go, all right, let's just break and try something new.
And that was what the guy at the shop recommended.
Just go fresh and, you know, keep the old one around for what you want to use it for.
Because it's not dead to me.
So, easy.
I've just been looking at the DP review site and now and between that and Martin saying,
I think you might have just cost me $1,000.
So, thanks, Martin.
(laughing)
But it's actually not that expensive.
For what you get, it is unbelievable.
You could go from much pricier cameras
with more megapixels and stuff,
but the question is, are you practically gonna use it?
Unless you're a professional photographer,
or you make a habit of carrying around your lenses
and a tripod and stuff,
if you just want a really cool little camera
that does things better in general
than an iPhone for stills, it's really not that expensive.
- I can vouch for that.
I've been seeing some of Martin's photos on Glass, Glass.photo.
And this is a nice little follow-up review that I promised from our Hemispheric News
members newsletter.
So I keep my promises and to anyone who wants to explore the newsletter, oneprimeplus.com,
it's in the long game.
And as you can see, it is in the long game because I remembered it and brought it up.
Yes.
Oneprimeplus.com.
And that was Camera Corner.
A very short brief brief review of the Olympus OMD E M 10 MK IV otherwise known as 4.
Mac clone backups. What do you two have to say because I'm seeing a robot head and a basketball,
no feet in the notes here. Yeah.
Sit back and let you two have it out here. I think I added this a while ago when I was
Doing so bit of background. I like backup. Everyone should like backup
It's not always the easiest but it's become easier over the years doing things like backblaze and time machine
Cloning is a thing if you're sort of like just over the hurdle of being like really a nerd
You'll probably be doing some cloning that used to be really important back in the day where?
System would go down and you'd have your clone and then you could just magically be back up and running
Then clones started to be a little bit weird in the way that they worked with the system
Then recently whenever I put this in here it was kind of like
Every time I get a new phone, I just sort of back up from iCloud and it's fine
Every time I get a new computer. I never pull the clone back. I just start fresh and
Almost everything is pulled down from the internet in one respect anyway
So it's like what the hell am I wasting my life doing these clones for
Because most of the time let's be honest. You're not checking your clone if it's like actually usable you do the clone
You're like, oh that's done. I'm sure that'll be helpful in the future. You never actually go and try to boot from it
Don't lie
so I kind of thought you know, what if I just don't do this cloning thing anymore because it kind of seems like a
waste of time and
Just having an extra drive laying around for that. So I stopped doing it. I stopped cloning altogether
I just don't care anymore. Like my system goes down. I have to go get a new computer and
Start over from scratch, which is the least big deal in the world anymore
So I'm curious a little bit of just backup strategy in general
Have either of you done cloning in the past and do you do it now and if you don't what do you do for backup?
Is it just Time Machine?
Is it Backblaze?
Is it both?
What are you doing?
- My answer is very quick and I'll get out of the way
'cause Andrew probably has more to say.
I do Time Machine and Backblaze
and it works beautifully for me.
The whole cloning thing you're talking about,
I haven't really ventured into.
- Yeah, that's where I'm at too.
I do Backblaze and Time Machine.
That's it.
- Andrew.
- I also use Time Machine and Backblaze.
I just wanna make it clear that
Because we're in the Southern Hemisphere.
Whereas you guys in the North always talk about back up.
In the Southern, we prefer to use the terminology back down.
Back down. Yeah, sorry.
That's a good-
Underneath. And it's more like-
Yeah.
Yeah. So, it's just another-
It's like the flip side of button up and button down.
Exactly. And it's just tiresome constantly hearing the Northern Hemisphere, you know, always talking about back up.
You know, we're on the bottom of the Earth.
We- back down.
So, just-
Yeah.
Just bring it back down here.
Exactly.
That makes sense.
Apologies for that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll try to watch that.
Yeah.
So with that out of the way, what I do is I have been, I used to use clones more often.
And like you, Jason, it was kind of like, why am I doing this?
This is a waste of time.
It's boring.
I forget to plug it in or the automation doesn't ever quite work.
Um, I did though have cause to make, I needed to make a clone recently.
I can't remember.
It was when my, what was it?
It was when my hard drives, I was changing my hard drives.
And it was exploded or something.
And I was trying to change hard drives and then there's a whole process.
And it turned out I didn't actually need a clone.
I needed a clone of a storage drive, like a backup rather than a clone of a working system.
Be that as it may, my recent experience, if you do want to go down the cloning path, I was always a proponent and user of SuperDuper.
when I was doing this all the time, Dave Nanyan's product.
I chose SuperDuper years ago
because I think John Gruber talked about it
and the interface for it at the time was quite simple
but very Mac-ish.
It's very clear and it was obvious what was happening.
So I went with SuperDuper, paid my money and used it.
I went to pull it out to do this task
and realized that my license had expired.
And so I needed to buy it again.
So it was like, well, do I buy it?
And I looked at the interface and I was like, eh, it still has that same look
that was very Mac-ish 10 years ago.
And it's not so Mac-ish anymore.
And it felt fragile.
It just felt a bit buggy and, and I didn't totally trust it just because of the
interface seemed a bit clunky and I didn't love it.
And I know that a lot of people now talk about Carbon Copy Cloner by Bombich software.
So I was like, well, it's a good chance to check it out.
Not having even looked at it for years and years.
Man that thing has come a long way.
That software is super impressive.
It does all the same stuff, but it gives you, it's got more features.
It's got a whole bunch of like, sort of auditing and checking and it notices if cloud files
aren't backed up because they're just stubs rather than being the actual file and warned
you about that.
It's pretty good, very good.
So that's the software I ended up using.
And now I have it, but I'm still not really in the cloning mind space anymore.
So while I have it, I don't think I'm going to use it like I used to, but I'll probably
still just make the occasional clone because why not?
But yeah, you're right, you don't need it anymore
'cause of all the cloud stuff,
it's very rare that you need it.
Unless your hard drive dies
and you're about to go into a meeting,
I just need like my system backup and running now
and you can do the external drive boot.
Why would you need it?
- Okay, interesting.
Yeah, I'm curious.
I'm sure people still do it.
And I think most, honestly, the last few years,
I've probably only done it out of habit.
I don't think I've,
I don't recall there being a time in the last
probably 10 years that I've actually used a clone
or needed it, but I've been doing it that whole time,
I think just out of habit and what if.
But yeah, I think getting a new system now,
I almost prefer, getting a new system is almost
a nice chance to just start over anyway
and sort of clear out all the crap that you've,
you know, oh, I installed like 4,000 apps
that I just wanted to try,
and there's all this crap left all over the place.
So it's sort of a blessing to be able to start over,
I think.
So, hi Mac, you heard it here first.
If you wanna exit stage left
and have a Mac Studio come in, that'd be okay.
Bop, boop, beep, bop, boop.
Cappuccino, I'm dying to know what the hell this is.
I'm assuming this is not the like code editor app.
This is something else.
- It actually makes you one, that's the idea.
It makes you a cappuccino.
That would be nice.
No flat whites, unfortunately.
I'd forgotten about the code editor.
Cappuccino, are you engaged with this at all?
I don't even know what it is.
No idea.
Have you guys not been following along on Discord?
Shame on you.
Probably not.
There are quite a few channels and as much as I love our hemispherians, I occasionally have to go to the toilet or eat or sleep or go to work.
I'm a completionist, so I have to read until it's all unread.
I hate this cappuccino. I hate the word cappuccino because as much as I see cappuccino written all around the place all the time, I never know where to put the double P's and double C's and double N's and double I's. It's the worst word to spell. I don't like it. I need a text expander.
Just double every letter and then you're covered.
But anyway, that being that as it might, oh, and I also know that when they say cappuccino, they're thinking of the American version of cappuccino, which is a terrible coffee.
You don't want that.
You want the Australian/Italian version of cappuccino, which is much nicer.
So apologies for all the Americans thinking about this app, thinking cappuccino.
Oh, right.
Okay.
And you're not, that's not a cappuccino.
Cappuccino is an Australian cappuccino.
Okay.
This app, it's, it's kind of stupid and fun.
And I know it's going to go down to a very dark place.
It is like an opportunity to record a voice memo to an audience or a group, a select group of people.
So it's microcasting of podcasting because it's only going to the people that you choose it to go to.
So is it maybe like Be Real?
Clubhouse.
Clubhouse.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
So.
So yes, you record a short, I think it limits you to three minutes.
And they've really lent into this whole coffee thing because that each one of those little recordings is a bean
Okay, and you know record your beans and you can attach a photo or bit of text that goes on the screen along with it
See already you're talking about recording my beans, and I just don't know if that's really gonna
Translate well, it's not only fans
Find Jason's beans in the shadows. I
I guess it could be whatever you want to be if you can fit in three minutes should be playing it's I.
Please go on about cappuccino so you record your little comments you can record multiple beans through the day yeah but your audience doesn't hear them.
Straight away they have to wait till 7am their local time and then the app collates all the beans have been brewed over the last 24 hour period and packages it up into a little podcast episode for you.
Sorry each morning I've been getting a brew a brew a fresh brew.
I'm catching a delivered to me for my morning coffee and I listen to you basically is better back and forth between me and mandarin in the chat.
Because we're the only two using it but I did notice this morning that I think first and burgers got in on the act because what we've got is we got a hemispheric views.
What's the collective.
Bean collective.
Coffee shop.
A barista is brewing the hemisphere views beans to brew a morning cappuccino.
Wow.
I want more of you to do it and if you do consecutive days they give you new cups.
So because I got three days of brewed coffee I did them I got like a new avatar which is like a different cup and then in five days I got another new mug.
And he's like a guitar playing guy, he's a copycat playing guitar, like the DJ spinners, I can't quite remember what he does.
How did this happen? Right underneath my nose and I let it get this far.
And I keep reminding myself.
How is it what happens? You were busy with backup Saturdays, Jason, and this is what happened.
This is what happens, yeah. We've gone down cappuccino, whatever. Wow, okay.
I was gonna say we'll put the group link in the show notes please start brewing some beans with us.
I just have to make an observation here. Please observe.
So outside of our hemispheric circles and the discord and this new brew that which we run away
like my work I work in you could say communications with a focus on social media
And I feel like Andrew is more of a kind of Gen Y/Z
millennial. You should jump on this bandwagon, be real, come brew with us.
Let's create a pyramid scheme and a corporate seminar kind of vibe.
Like, are you OK, Andrew?
I'm fighting against my natural physical age.
This is what it is. It's like a nerd midlife crisis.
It's like, hey, what's that?
What's that thing? Hey kids, what's happening? You know, the Steve Buscemi thing.
Steve Buscemi, that's you with the skateboard.
Yeah.
We're going to have to Photoshop that now.
Another thing to do.
So are you still be reeling or being real?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Okay.
So are you just getting like a notification while you're sitting on the toilet that you have to share what you're doing all of a sudden?
Yeah.
I'm liking it.
You have a minute to do it.
I'm liking it less because I've only got two other people that I'm following slash sharing with.
That's a bit lonely really.
One of those people is in Portland, Oregon though.
So there you go.
And it's not Jason.
To be clear, that is not me.
Yeah.
I just dox you?
What do people know you're in Portland?
I think so.
That's okay.
I think it's even on the website.
Okay, alright.
It's like to anyone who thought that he was in Portland, Maine,
which we established he is not.
I live in Perth, Oregon.
It's yeah.
The third Perth.
Okay, well, we will definitely put that in the show notes.
So people can can start brewing with Andrew.
There you go.
That was Cappuccino Corner.
Probably don't even need to put a corner on that because I don't think we'll be coming
back to it.
But never say never.
Media Corner has been like door locked, lights off,
cobwebs are just everywhere.
People are using it for just storage room now.
- Oh, Media Corner on Discord goes off.
Media Corner lives on Discord beautifully.
This just hasn't been on the podcast.
- Yeah, but like the, see what's happened though?
Physical Brick and Mortar Media Corner
basically just shut down 'cause it's all online now,
'cause all the kids are online.
No, no.
We're opening back up Media Corner proper.
- Yeah, we've got a special theme.
We got a special theme tune for Media Corner and everything.
It was the OG Corner.
- Does the theme even work anymore?
Has it been tuned?
We don't know.
It's probably all out of whack.
It's like C sharp now or some musical term.
- That would be C++.
- There you go.
So let's get into a little bit
of what I like to call Media Corner.
(upbeat music)
- Media Corner.
- Did I put all of these in here?
- Yeah, I didn't do anything 'cause there were too many.
So off you go.
- I only recognize one of these programs.
All right, well, I'll be fairly swift
since we're doing everything as programming languages.
First one, Prey.
- Are you being Swift UI?
Or are you being Swift the other one?
- Swift the other one.
- Okay.
- Yeah, version six.
- Cool.
- Ironically, that's let us down.
- Eight.
What?
Prey.
- Keep going.
- What?
- The newest.
- I didn't get that.
I'll have to figure that one out.
- You're talking about being Swift
getting through this and it's like taking time. Keep going.
I'm sorry, Martin. Martin's on deadline.
Come on, Jason, speed it up.
Jeez, I'm trying. I'm trying. This is the fifth time now. Prey, the newest movie in
the Predator franchise. If you don't like Predator, don't watch this. If you do like
Predator, you should definitely watch this because the only downside is I think it was on Hulu.
I think it's like a Hulu only kind of thing. So already you're like,
I don't know straight to Hulu that seems a little bit dodgy
But it actually was really good and something different for the predator universe
So I would say definitely give it a watch. I enjoyed it quite a bit
I don't know if either of you have seen it or at least heard of it
I have I have heard of it not seen it
Look the thing I liked about the original predator is that had Jesse Ventura a wrestler WWE wrestler in it
Does this one has a wrestler in it? Is there maybe a John Cena?
No, no, that's actually what I like the most about it is that you don't know the people in it
It wasn't just a let's do another movie and like pull in
You know the people from the first one that are now 85 years old and try to make them be superheroes again
Like no, we're not doing that. It's a completely different story all new angle. Everything is different about it. And that's what makes it
Interesting and entertaining. So pray get on it next
Television series gonna switch gears a little bit here going from the box office to the home box office
That was intentional because it's on HBO max
It is the flight attendant
with
People whose names I have forgotten
But it will be in the show from the Big Bang Theory. There you go. That's one of them
It was a very interesting show. I wasn't quite sure what to expect from it
I watched the first one and was like, hmm
I don't know maybe and then it turned into a I just want to watch this thing all the way through
so I went through it fairly quickly and I really enjoyed the
The story the way the story was told. I think the characters were fun and
Overall, it was just a good series to sit down and watch over a weekend
There is a season 2 which I have not started yet, so I cannot vouch for that. I can only vouch for season 1.
So I also think maybe season 2 is one of those where like it's the same people but it's sort of a different story arc.
It's not just a continuation, which I think would be good because the first season, I don't think we need more.
I think it was a good nice end-to-end thing.
Next!
I did not add for all mankind season 3 because I have not even seen season 1 so I suspect.
Someone else added that or I was having a fever dream.
I've only seen episode 1 of season 3 was very good to 7 and time to continue and Andrew has put his hand up so it was him.
Take to taking on board man's position in the series I will not spoil anything other than to say if you watched.
Season one and found it to be very slow going and a bit of a grind and a little bit boring. That's okay
They learned a lot and season two picked up the pace and was a lot of fun
Season and then again, it was all historical, you know, so it was looking back in time, but on a different
Things in the world happened differently
This one is still carrying on the premise that it's a different world things are kind of kind of an ultimate timeline
But kind of similar, but now we have we're still in
We've the past I think we're still in the past trying to remember now, but it's it's very nice
Yeah, it's very modern so it feels and some of the tech that they use is almost they've advanced more quickly than
Than what we actually in the first episode they did flash a Newton kind of like Apple product placement
Which I thought was hilarious that can you that continues to make appearances Martin, so you will enjoy this series
There's a lot in very funny
The Newson is an amazing device in the alternate universe, but this season three is,
season three is awesome. It's really, it moves so fast. There's so much action compared to the
other two series. It's a lot of fun, really enjoyable and um, tension, drama,
sci-fi, the whole bit. Get on it. I suppose it's advisable to watch from the beginning though.
Because it is. Yeah, you need to watch from the beginning. You need to know these people.
Okay. Yeah. It's quite yeah. I think I can agree for all mankind. I started watching it and then
I think just a million other shows happened and it fell off the list. So I will have to get back
on that. She helped. This is the best television show on TV right now. We started watching this
recently and I am annoyed that it is coming out every week because I want to watch the next one
and it's not out yet. It is hilariously fun. It is such a different thing. I know like the whole
Marvel, yeah, we're over Marvel. There's too much Marvel. It's frigging great the way that they're
doing this show. I have to say it's wildly different than anything else. It doesn't take
itself too seriously in a very good way. And the character is just fun. I didn't really know
anything about She-Hulk as a character. I don't know a ton about the Marvel universe, but
I knew she was a lawyer and it's just damn fun. And I would say, give it a go because it's great.
After seeing the trailer, I don't have anything nice to say, so I'll stop there.
It's great.
At risk of pulling the show down.
It's freaking great.
I don't think I've ever been more turned off watching a show than after seeing the
trailer for that show. I'll be honest.
I could see you not being into it. Yeah, I don't think it's a Martin show necessarily.
And I shouldn't, I'm not judging the entire program because I haven't seen it,
but as a trailer, as a piece of advertising, I went, I do not think that I will like that.
I don't think I ever saw the trailer actually. I'll have to go back and watch it and see what
it was like. Yeah, there you go. Well, I still drag the show down. Yeah. Thank you. Good job.
Media Corner.
Andrew, I'm granting you 20 seconds and I'm going to time you.
All right. This is a topic that came in at the last minute, not on a card of any kind.
This is entirely digital.
You have 20 seconds to give one piece of business wisdom to our hemisphere.
Oh, this is not where it starts.
I'm going to give you a five second countdown to start.
And then you've got 20 seconds to say it.
I'm going to tell you to shut up.
Oh, geez. Five.
Oh, my gosh. Four.
Three. Two.
One go.
I was watching first be all this day off the other night and the teacher he started talking about the Laffer curve.
And Laffer curve is a bunch of Reaganomics it's dumb don't follow it it's like you can cut taxes increase them.
But I found that lecture really interesting to better than the movie.
Business corner is over thank you very much Andrew that's the episode.
I can't believe you actually like had something.
I think you're talking about his stream deck in your only going to talk about.
I was thinking I had to stream deck thing going on in my mind.
Can I have 20 seconds for stream deck.
Yes no because I can take it off please and it's time critical.
Okay, in the last four or five days for some unknown reason my Stream Deck software just keeps crashing.
I think it's when my Mac goes to sleep. I load it up. My Stream Deck hardware is blank.
The software is no longer loaded. I've updated it to the latest version. The problem still exists. What's happened?
I don't understand. It was so good for so long and now it's useless.
