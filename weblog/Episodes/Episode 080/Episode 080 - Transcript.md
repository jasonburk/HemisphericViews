Course now the fly disappears.
Will he saw your here less than inconspicuous giant green flyswatter hand you should probably get something a little more subdued.
It's good I'm.
It is gonna go down he's going down at some point I am gonna smash this fly is nothing worse than a fly oh there is.
He's up on the window.
Is it like a fly fly or like one of those little gnat kind of flies?
Gnat fly.
We're in Australia, mate.
Okay.
We have gnats.
Okay.
We just have big honking flies.
Yeah.
So, it's probably like the size of a crow and it's just circling you in your office.
Yes.
That makes sense.
Why do you think we have huntsmen that are so huge?
Like they've got full meals at every time of the day.
Everything's in proportion.
like our spiders sit down with a knife and fork and you know get into it.
He's about to serve one up on a big green hand.
It's buzzing around.
I'll get a picture of that in the notes for everybody to see his big green hand.
It's quite impressive.
Oh did we get him?
Nah I think they just flew away.
Oh come on.
I put something down first.
First yeah.
Yeah or firstenburg nice guy but this is first.
What if he has a brother called second, like, or secondenberg?
You'd hate to be thirdenberg.
Well, that rolls off the tongue.
Or fourthenberg, which just sounds like the first name, but mispronounced.
So my seven-year-old who's just lost his two front teeth would probably, he's trying to
say firstenberg, but he's actually saying fourthenberg.
Anyway, continuing the tech adjacent bit in the sense that we're not currently talking
about technology. This is something that I wanted to bring up because I'm sure that you
too and listeners will have thoughts. I want to talk about eggs. And I mean, eggs that
come out of a chicken that you cook generally and eat with meals. Now, I have a difficult
relationship with the egg. And I can confirm that Natasha agrees with this. Somewhere along
the line in Australia, people decided that all breakfast meals, unless it's a pancake or
pikelet or flapjack or crepe or whatever you want to call it, everything needs to have egg in it.
And most of the time it will be poached, fried or boiled, right? Yes, Jason.
Question. Is there a difference between a flapjack and a pancake?
I don't know, but I just know that Americans use that word. So I wanted to be inclusive.
Just checking. Go ahead. You can look that up while I'm speaking if you want.
I just remember Goldmember said "a Noston Powers" is a synonym for the pancake. So, off you go.
Anyway, I like eggs, but I don't like yolk. So, what I'm getting at here is that I like
scrambled eggs. Now, I've tried eggs in many forms. I've tried them boiled and painted during
Macedonian Orthodox Easter with my relatives. I've tried them runny in bacon and egg rolls.
I've tried them in dinners, breakfasts, lunches, whatever. It does not matter how the yolk is
presented. I think it's putrid. Okay. It ruins everything that it touches. Right. And it came
to my mind to bring up recently because I went to a cafe and I noticed that they had a sausage
and egg roll. Everything was egg and that was the most palatable. And I went up to the counter and I
And I said, "You do the sausage and egg roll, right?"
And they said, "Well, yes."
And I said, "What are the chances of that being scrambled
"other than what I assume is runny yolk everywhere?"
And they looked at me like I was diseased.
But they obliged, they did it, and it was delicious.
So I wanna know from you two,
what's your preference as far as egg?
Do you eat it or not?
And do you like it running over every other thing
said dish to the point that it just obliterates flavor. Go on.
This is highly surprising to me, first of all, that this is such a... you wouldn't think an
egg yolk would be that much of a controversial food topic for someone.
To me it's the fact that everyone assumes that everyone wants egg in a certain style.
I just... am I scrambled such a big deal.
Right. But you're saying like any style is like, it's a nope for sure.
It's the yolk. That's the trouble.
Yeah. You just don't want it regardless. So, your preferred style is egg white. It sounds like.
Yeah. White I have no problem with when it's cooked.
Yeah.
It's the yolk.
Okay. But scrambled is okay, which includes the yolk.
It totally changes the texture. When I eat yolk, particularly when it's like, let's say,
boiled, I get the same kind of feeling as if I ate something like liver or pate. I find the whole
flavor and texture of it to be strange and grainy.
So it's not the yolk. It is the presentation of the yolk.
No, it's the yolk. It's disgusting.
Okay. I'm trying to get you back into team yolk, but it's not. It doesn't sound like it's working.
I've tried it for years and I'm not actually a fussy eater. It's one of the few things that
that I find rebulsive.
- Andrew, do they yolk on the Western side?
- I love myself a yolk.
So good, although my yolk, I only like yolk if it's runny.
If it's gone hard inside and powdery,
unless it's in like a deviled egg,
you know, the sort of on a plate
with the thing on the orange stuff on top.
Oh, that's okay.
- Paprika. - Yeah, that's the one.
It's the only time I want a dry egg yolk.
I want a runny egg.
There's nothing better.
So wait a minute you bring up a deviled egg.
Is that because of your American connection?
I think so because I used to have.
Or is a deviled egg actually a thing there?
No, not anymore.
I think it was in the 70s.
Oh, yeah, of course.
Yeah, I think it came from my American heritage because I
remember having them quite a lot as a kid and I do miss them
and very occasionally you will see one like once every eight
years you see one you're like, oh, I'm gonna get into those
bad boys and I have thought about making them and then I
I look at the recipe, I'm like, "Eh, seems like a lot of effort".
But no, I like a runny-
Devil eggs are the best.
I like a runny yolk.
It's nothing bad.
That's why I- When I get a bacon and egg sandwich, I'm always worried that it's going to have been sitting around for too long and the egg will- The egg yolk will have congealed and that destroys it.
And then you just need to squirt a lot of barbecue sauce on it to compensate.
But if I could get a yolk-
Aren't you ever bothered by the thought that you're like ingesting uncooked chicken liquid?
I prefer not to use that.
It's just that's just a label you don't want to use.
But that's what it is.
I know, but it's delicious when it's just warm.
It's warmed up and like a poached egg.
Warmed up chicken liquid.
Yep, you're selling it.
Poached egg?
Oh man, when you just cut into it, it just goes, "Poof!"
And the chicken liquid just drizzles over everything else.
It's delicious.
Love that chicken liquid.
So good.
Jason you just sent a photo of a box or tray of eggs in our iMessage chat, what's the deal?
Yeah, we just got those actually, we just got a giant box of chicken eggs from a local person and they're very good and their yolks are delicious and actually more orange I find than kind of the ones you would normally get.
Store-bought yolks are pathetic if you if you get any like you've got their homegrown homegrown chickens where the the the yolk is almost fluorescent.
Because they've been so well cared for and they've eaten good food and wandered around the garden.
It's a deep hemispheric views orange for sure.
That's what you want so maybe Martin maybe but maybe Martin doesn't not like yoke maybe he's only ever had bad yolk.
No I had a yoga around the world and it's not good around the world you that's the thing I'm I'm when it comes to my I'm not fussy about it and I will actually revisit foods that I know that I didn't like in.
The hope or with the openness that I could like it again sweet potatoes another one sweet potato I think is a lie it's neither a potato nor sweet it's just weird.
It's the king of the potatoes.
It's not it's it's a it's a lie okay.
This is sweet no it's not chocolate sweet.
And it gets all gooey in the middle and crispy on the outside.
I would say burnt and disappointed.
I'm not no and look feet no listen to me here there's a fantastic restaurant not far from here called a victory gourmet kitchen.
Right it's a willing gone places and switched around the years as a kid even though I wasn't a huge fan of sweet potato I loved this sweet potato fries crunchy I got the appreciation of flavor I enjoyed them so I'll eat them but over time and I still like the restaurants I'm not crapping on them here.
This week potato fries have gotten chunkier and chunkier to the point that they're softer and just essentially sweet potato oven and oven I don't like that.
I want fries. So occasionally you get a crispier one that gets that kind of thing that you're
going for. But if it's not, it's just a chunky piece of mountain vegetable, not into it.
So we've got chicken, chicken liquid, chunky mountain vegetables. So that's like your ideal
breakfast. I will have some chicken liquid with a side of chunky mountain vegetables, please.
Correct. Yeah, that's what you want.
It's a very rustic cafe. I think that menu is very, very catered to a certain-
Oh, you're going to find the chicken liquid everywhere. And sometimes it's going to be
runny and sometimes it's not. But look, if I order a burger or a McMuffin, there's one,
like I'll order a sausage McMuffin, but sometimes for some reason people hear
"and egg" in the middle, didn't ask for that. And I get the rogue egg. The best part of that is
because they've made it powdery as Andrew sold with that very convincing adjective,
I can just cut it out. So I just cut out this little yellow disc of hate.
And then I just have the albumen, which is all right. Albumen's fine.
So wait, isn't it McMuffin, egg and sausage and a biscuit? Isn't that what a McMuffin is?
A biscuit. Oh, that's the American term. No, no, we call them English muffins.
It's McMuffin.
No, I think we have both. We have one that's a biscuit and one that's-
Now, when you say biscuit, in Australia, we're talking about something that you
dip into your tea or have at afternoon tea.
Yeah, like a, I don't know, what the hell do you guys call it? You call it a-
Scone.
Sure. Yeah, where it's more like crumbly.
We've talked about this before.
But crumbly. Yeah, no, this is confusing. Look, here you have the option at least,
You can have it with or without egg.
I order it without egg.
Sometimes people mishear or they're just used to the standard.
They put egg in it.
I cut part of it out, the offending part,
and I move on with my life and try not to blame them too much.
That's how it works.
- Is it called a McBiscuit?
- So a McMuffin is just the muffin in a sausage?
- It's essentially a breakfast burger,
but in the style of an English muffin,
which is a slightly different type of bread.
Not a crumpet. - Yeah, no.
- And not a muffin like you take top and bottom.
It's an English muffin.
No, particularly not in the English
kind of Australian parlance, no.
- No, and we'd call that a McBickey.
Of course you would.
- Yeah, McBickey would be.
And in fact, I don't know why that never took off
'cause we've always had McDonald's biscuits,
but they call them cookies, which I don't agree with,
but we move on.
Why did we not call them McBickies?
- They're very sweet.
- Now that's sweet, thank you.
Is a sweet potato?
Not really.
We're talking about different things here.
- Where are we at on the egg front now?
- You're allowed to like it, I don't.
And all I'm asking for,
I'm not saying people can't enjoy egg.
I think it's fantastic that we have
so many different ways of enjoying egg.
I just don't know to be looked at like I'm diseased
because I don't happen to enjoy warmed up chicken liquid.
- I will continue to look at you as though you were diseased,
but I do have one follow-up question.
- Go on.
- A hard cooked egg?
Is that, that's out for you as well?
I just don't like the flavour of yolk in whatever kind of runniness to powdery,
you know, state it is on the spectrum.
I don't like that flavour.
But if it is a scrambled egg, it's OK because it's sort of mixed in, like,
masked by the rest.
Correct. The texture changes entirely and the albumen smooths out or dilutes its
flavour.
What about an omelette?
It's fluffy. It's fluffy.
You do an omelette?
Yeah, omelettes are good because that's essentially scrambled.
That's a fluffy kind of egg.
Yeah. They're great.
So you see, I like egg.
I just don't want this yellow crap enforced on me.
I got a cra-. I got a real craving now for a soft boiled egg.
I'm slamming some eggs for some just sloppy, sloppy chicken eggs for dinner tonight, for sure.
Totally.
See, sloppy, another word that doesn't sell it.
It's like, I love me some slop.
No.
Just gooey, just running down your hand.
Yeah.
Like can't even contain it.
You've got to lick it.
It's just everywhere.
Yeah.
Yeah, right off the forearm, just yellow.
Love it.
Okay.
And this is the Yolk Corner.
Yolk Corner.
Yep.
Do you remember when we started this podcast and we thought it would be like techie?
You know, we're going to talk a lot of tech on this podcast.
And now we've, we've meandered through the Yolk Corner.
Wow.
Yeah. It's almost not even adjacent anymore.
It's just sort of non-existent.
Well, I can see something kind of technological as the next topic.
Off you go, Jason.
Another day, another scammer.
- Yeah, that was fun.
I just thought I would do my bit of awareness
for the community and let them know
about a little fun scam that happened recently.
So we have a Discord server.
I think most folks know that.
If you don't, jump on in.
It's great.
Everyone there is lovely.
I got a DM, direct message, from someone saying
Something to the effect of,
hey, is this your Steam profile or whatever?
I was like, it was, it was clearly my Steam profile.
So I said, oh yeah, that's me.
Didn't know, I thought maybe on the off chance
somebody maybe listened to the show or something
or just found me through my website or something.
Anyway, I was like, yeah, that's me.
And then they went into this long thing
about how they had reported me
for like stealing money from them or something.
But by mistake, they wanted me to know
that it was a mistake, they accidentally did it.
I was like, oh, shoot.
So I'm playing along like from the get-go right away.
I'm playing along like, oh, that's so terrible.
Oh no, what are we gonna do?
That sounds so bad.
They're like, yeah, it's real bad.
You're gonna get like permanently banned
and like all your games are gonna be taken away.
And I was like, oh, geez, that sounds so real and scary.
So, the best part was that they were like, "Yeah, but I think we can fix it."
It's like, "Oh, geez, thank goodness.
Not only did you present me with a problem, but also a solution.
This is so perfect.
Why am I even here?
You should just take care of it."
And then the solution turned out to be to contact Steam support, wait for it, via direct
message in Discord to a very specific one guy, his handle. I was like, wow. So Steam,
a multi-country, huge, probably one of the biggest platforms in the world, uses one guy
as a DM in Discord for its support. Is this like the Tasmanian guy Andrew met
on support once? I think so, yeah. We were one step away
from the guy in Tasmania doing screen sharing with me to get my stuff fixed.
That guy was legit.
Come on now.
It seemed really legit.
Yeah, he had screenshots, he had little red arrows pointing, telling me exactly where
to click just so I didn't mess it up.
So I told him, long story short, I told him that I contacted Steam through their actual
support just in case, because you know, this was really serious.
And he sort of just never came back to me.
It was very weird after I played along for so long, I got no payoff from it.
But I will just say there are scammers literally everywhere
trying to screw you over in any possibility that they can.
And it's always that thing where they present you with something
and then immediately try to turn up the heat by saying that there's this some time,
like in finite time frame in which if you don't do something, bad things will happen.
Speaking of scams, this month, you have a very short period to sign up to OnePrimePlus,
where you can actually hear the most recent episode where we spoke about the experience
of bullying, extroversion and introversion. So sign up now or yeah, we'll empty your bank accounts.
OnePrimePlus.com.
It's in the scam.
Have you ever had one of those bad dreams where it's, it has it, it's a bunch of little dreams,
but they have like a theme across all of them, even though they're all very different topics.
Is that ever happened to you? Sorry, within the same night or
across different nights? Within the same night, same night, yeah.
No, I have a very different kind of dream style that happens on over again, but you go first.
Okay. So this was one of those where every little, I'll call them micro dreams. Let's go with that.
Every dream was something like going wrong or being terrible.
And one of them was related to the both of you.
And maybe it's happening.
It could be happening right now.
And I just don't know it.
I hope not.
But what happened was, we're going through, doing the show, recording, all is well.
And then we go to do the three, two, one, stop.
Computer.
Frozen.
Get back in.
audio file nowhere to be found. That is a nightmare. It recorded nothing for like an hour and a half.
It was, I, I, full on panic in the dream, like, I didn't know what to do. I was... Did you remember
that we also have the backup for the remote recording on our end? No, no, I did not. I don't
think we had it in this scenario. It was a, it was truly, this is the only place this data exists and
and it is now gone.
It was really, really scary, I will have you know.
Of all of the things of the micro dreams,
that was the scariest one.
And arguably probably the least important
of all the things that happened in these dreams.
But in my brain, that was the most important one.
So.
- Wow.
I'm imagining what an episode without you
would sound like, even if you were there,
it'd be like, "So how's everything going
in Portland, Jason?"
"Yeah, the weather looks great."
Oh, really? That's a good one.
Let me just be like nonsense.
That's what it would have been like.
And I don't know why I sound so stupid, but that's what the voice that I put on.
So. So that was my horrible nightmare.
I hope it never actually happens.
And I hope this is not that coming to reality right now.
I won't go into full detail, but just because I made reference earlier to the types of
dream that I have, I don't really have nightmares.
But if I do have a bad or unsettling kind of dream, they're generally in some sort of liminal space.
I'm always trying to find something or somewhere or a destination through an empty space where I can hear people who I can't see.
It's very weird.
I would like Mark to have a dream where he is trapped inside an egg, just like Matrix style in the yolk, you know, as Neo comes out of that scoop.
But it's Martin coming out of the goop and the goop is egg yolk.
I think that would be amazing.
So you just want me to be in the Matrix, but it's a tub of yolk.
Yeah. So what an amazing dream that would be.
Because it would be kind of like, I'm in the Matrix.
This is cool. And suddenly you're like, so you're hyped up for this dream.
It's really cool. And then you burst out and you realise that it's just egg yolk.
And suddenly the dream turns into a nightmare.
That would be amazing.
Chicken juice all the way down.
So it's basically the fifth movie.
But Keanu Reeves has substituted for me and it's called The Matrix Yoko Erections or something.
Yeah, I would like this a lot.
That sounds bad. That really worked.
Yeah. I think we workshop that title a little bit, but.
You can have some musical intermission sort of thing in the movie and it could be,
you could call it Yoko Ono.
Oh, very good. I'm sure that's what she was going for with all of her career.
Should we move on?
I went to a basketball launch event the mighty Perth Redbacks organisation.
No, you did.
Yeah, I did.
You?
I did.
I know, basketball.
Who would have thought?
Did you jump through hoops to get to that one?
That's clever.
But it made me think a little bit about a question.
So in that environment, the players are kind of like the stars of the show.
You know, there's sponsors and there's people like me on the periphery and there's other stuff, but nobody really cares about those people.
It's about the players as the stars of the night.
And then you go to other events and there'll be, you know, VIPs that sit at the top table for the dinner and that kind of thing.
Might be a politician, it might be a business person, it might be a well regarded speaker, a media personality, whatever the case may be.
The VIP of the night, right?
So as a ordinary person, when you go to events like that, do you feel a compulsion to go and talk to the VIP?
Or do you kind of think, "I need to actively avoid the VIP because I'm just going to look like a twerp going in like,
trying to ingratiate myself with the VIP person." Even though you could say that's kind of why you're there in the first place.
But do they really want to talk to you? Like, they don't. So I generally go in with the view of, I am not going to engage with the VIP. I'm almost just going to play it cool. Like I'm here. I'm VIP in my own right. I don't need to talk to the nominated VIP.
So, but then I feel like maybe I'm missing the whole point of the thing. But then when you talk to the VIP, what do you say? Just like, "Oh, hi, I'm like, not as important as you tonight. But another night, I might be more important than you." So it's very conflicting.
Like tonight.
Like right now.
I'm the VIP.
Right now.
I'm like right here, host of Hemisphere Views.
Like everybody wants a piece of me right now.
It's good to know our place here, Jason.
I'm very encouraged by this.
So two plebs and a star.
That's the, that's the new slogan for the show.
Hemisphere Views, two plebs and a star.
So guys, I'm asking you, what's your take?
Because generally I find that I don't engage with the VIP.
And I'm really curious to know how you two interface these sort of events.
Talk me through it.
Martin, I think you already answered. Martin already answered.
Yeah, but I have more to say. Surprise.
What?
So, yes, I do like to say hello, but it all depends on context, right? Now, I think at
the type of event that you're talking about, where someone is there because they have something
special to say, or they're a keynote speaker, or a guest of honour, whatever, they are there
in the context that they have something of value to say to the community or the audience that has
assembled. Right? So you don't have to go and annoy them and you choose your timing correctly,
or maybe there's a head table or a certain group that is separate so you don't interfere.
I don't know. But I think it's encouraging or worthwhile to at least go and say something if
you have something interesting and valuable to say, because you're kind of acknowledging the
point of why they were there in the first place. If everyone had the attitude of "I don't want to go
and bother them" then they would be invited to an event when no one speaks to them. It doesn't
really make sense. So I think if you pick your timing right and have something interesting to say
or something to ask about relevant to their career or their appearance, it's good. But if you're at
a restaurant and they're enjoying a meal and you go "Oh, it's such and such in the corner" and
and you've bothered them in what is otherwise a private time, that's bad.
So, just pick your moment is what I'm saying.
And don't be annoying.
Good answer. If anyone's in Wollongong and they see Martin out to dinner, bother him.
Please. People do.
Just go right up there. You don't have to tell him that.
They go up to him and say, so tell me, what's Andrew Canyon really like?
He's- Because he seems amazing.
Well, he's a star.
He's just- I kind of sweat in his presence, not just because my study is hot, but because he's just such a star.
Oh, VIP, very important personality.
Where do I stand on this?
So I will fly into that room so fast towards this VIP, just all just ready to go.
And then my brain will catch up to my body and be like, you, this is not you.
Absolutely do not go talk to this person ever.
You should leave right now.
And then that's usually how that will go for me.
So it's, it's a, it's a strong start and a very, very weak finish.
- It's so intriguing to me, Jason,
that you have this anxiety about talking
'cause I think you can talk, you sound intelligent.
- I barely keep it together talking to you guys.
- Amazing.
- I'm fine, it's the star that we have here.
- It's the star power that's just like,
I need to almost video mute him because it's just,
see, I'm fumbling for words right now
because of the personality that's just overtaking me.
- It just depends.
And look, for anyone who listens to the episode
that we just put out on One Prime Plus,
which features a discussion about extroversion
and introversion, a lot of this comes down to the context.
I think if you remember that we're all human beings
and we all have strengths and foibles and funny quirks,
a lot of the time it's the event or the space
and the context of it that makes you comfortable
uncomfortable and that might be really obvious but think about when you walk
into a library or a church with the very same people you were just talking to
outside and suddenly it's "shhh mmm" you just adjust. Whereas if you saw that
famous person ordering coffee in front of you at a takeaway shop or something
and you just said to them "oh love your work, been following you forever" and they'd
say "no worries thanks mate" and move on there's no problem. It's that feeling of
we have assembled everyone in a special room and everyone gets all kind of
jittery about it we're all just people and to say hi well people let me know
what you do back in the discord here's your call to action jump in the discord
tell us what you do he's pulling in the CTA here it here it is so the call to
action is how do you feel talking to me host of hemispheric view yeah throw
whenever Andrew Canyon pops into the chat oh man every time I get every time
I get that I message and it's like, "Oh!"
[Music]
Hey, I sent you two really valuable iMessages just yesterday, so don't you be criticizing
my iMessages.
I would never.
I feel like I just wanted to take a moment to share this, because maybe I can move this
information from a chat with Jason Burt to a chat with the Hemispheric Views, because
Jason and I have had a thing for a long time where we don't value sabbaticals.
We think the idea of sabbatical is a bit corny, a bit silly.
And yet we are inundated with podcasts in our world where sabbaticals seem to be the
most amazing thing that you could ever do.
And there's constant talk of sabbaticals.
So whenever I hear a podcast-
Can you, because I've heard this, but can you define sabbatical as you're both intolerant
of for the show?
Well, I think that's the problem.
not the sabbatical the term or what it actually is. It's the usage of the word for seemingly
anything you ever do that is not going to work for any amount of time between one day and six years.
See, I would call that a holiday.
Right.
But it seems like the thing that gets me about sabbaticals, it seems like
you don't go to work, but you still spend this entire R&R period thinking about work and how
you can do work better. And it's like, dude, just chill out. Just, just stop. This cult
of productivity is unhealthy. Just take a break. So whenever I hear anything about sabbatical,
I thanks to the wonderful feature of Overcast, where you can clip an audio piece and share
it with somebody. I will clip that piece.
Guess who he shares it with?
And I share it with Jason, because we have had conversations about sabbaticals and have
both like gone, come on, what's going on? So I, it is, it is joyful for me whenever I hear
sabbatical mentioned and I have taken it and I've turned it. It's been something that annoys me
greatly to hear it being talked about. Now, whenever I hear it talked about, I'm like, yes,
I get to send this to Jason Burke. - Content for me. Lucky me.
- Put that off my chest. I feel better actually. - All right.
I think you're also editing this so let's what are we at 41 minutes?
Okay we got four minutes guys, let's wrap it up.
Four minutes?
Type 45!
Whatever doesn't make it is what I'll edit as the next One Prime Plus.
Think of it that way.
Can I tell a short story?
Yeah.
Can I also bring in another corner?
You've got three and a half minutes apparently.
No, well we've got the other content so you've got about 90 seconds.
Go.
Alright now it's about all I need so I'm gonna bring in what I call sayings corner
So the saying it's my way or the highway is that is that understood understood by both of you got it?
Yes. Here's the story
We were driving
From Oregon to Washington yesterday DC
lovely little drive
No, Washington State. I was gonna say that would be a long drive. Okay, just right above us
Yeah, real, real much shorter than DC.
Driving up, uh, up five, highway five, lovely little drive, winding.
Can you just say I- I- five?
Was it I-five?
I think I said highway five, but yeah, I-five works as well.
The five if you're down in California.
The interstate?
The interstate.
Sorry.
Just get, just enjoy the American road.
Get out of story corner.
I'm in story corner right now. Get out!
Mute! Report!
So I'm driving up the highway
And there's exits as you can imagine
There's one. There's another one
What exit is coming up?
Ahead. Oh, interesting. It is
not any other exit other than
Martin's Way
(laughing)
And immediately I see this sign that says Martin's Way.
(laughing)
It could not have been a faster connection
where I think it's Martin's Way or the highway.
(laughing)
And what did I choose?
I continued right on the highway.
I did not take Martin's Way.
- What a pipe of that.
(laughing)
- But boy, did that just feel like I was breaking
some kind of law.
(laughing)
It was too perfect.
It just was so wonderful.
So that was my short story about my way or the highway.
- Naturally, you did not reach your destination.
- Surprisingly, I did actually.
I don't know what I would have found taking Martin's way
and I was a little bit concerned to do that.
So we kept going with our original destination in mind,
but just lets you know that every once in a while,
Martin's Way or the highway does actually happen.
- That's amazing.
(Andrew laughing)
- Show title.
- Yeah, I think so.
- Well, if you ever do take the I-5 again,
as host of Hemispheric Views, Andrew just recommended,
you gotta tell us what was down Martin's Way.
- I think next time I would explore it.
Yeah, we had like a firm, we had a plan.
So I didn't really want to deviate, but it would be interesting to see what's over there.
Speaking of saying, Xandre, I reckon in Australia we should start saying what would annoy or confuse Americans, which would be it's my path or the footpath.
Ooh, is that your version of sidewalk?
That's what you call the sidewalk or the pavement.
We call it the footpath because it's the path where our feet go.
That makes sense. Yeah, I could see that.
I don't know if you're annoyed, but I just wanted to say it.
What if it's not like a concrete type sidewalk thing
and it's like a dirt path,
that would still be a footpath, right?
- It would just be a path, maybe.
- Oh, that's just a path, but you still use your feet.
- Yeah, yeah, but the footpath is formally
the thing that ends in a gutter.
Do you call it a gutter?
It's the curb.
I don't know, it's getting confusing there,
but it's the place where you walk
to avoid getting hit by cars.
- Well, the curb is the actual fall off.
gutter is the part that's lower than the sidewalk. Yeah, I think we acknowledge that, but we just
refer to the whole thing as the gutter. Like you fell in the gutter. I mean, they're kind of,
it depends on which side you're coming from, right? Like if you're coming from the top side,
you're kind of curb to gutter, but if you're going the other way, you're gutter to curb.
So, yeah. And we do have signs that say, please park rear to curb or something in certain aspects.
So we do use the word, but I never hear anyone saying, oh, mind the curb.
Yeah, because it's a curb as though it's a barrier. It's meant to stop from going on to
the footpath. My aim in this particular meandering section is just to say curb in other words so much
that they lose all sense of meaning. It's starting to happen.
Yeah. Oh, I love that. What's that? There's a thing for that, right? Where you say the same
word so many times, which is like, does that, is it my spelling that right? Does that even
sound right anymore? Who am I? Curb. Curb. Curb.
Curb your enthusiasm. Curb. Curb. I like that show. Curb. You said curb. Curb at the frog. Curb.
Tech stuff because that's what we're about. I've got a little bit of follow-up. You'll remember
that my Fantastical subscription was coming to an end and I had discussed the various options.
So my fantastic subscription has now come to an end and I went one step further I deleted all the apps so there's no.
There is no going all of what a fantastico and the and the card hop so all of those been deleted from all devices so I am now entering a whole new phase with no fantastico in my life which has been.
There and there abouts for many many years.
You didn't even try to see what the the free did for you said you came up with a banner straightaways like you are the product remember you are the product exactly.
Oh sorry my I always forget that can you not blog my apologies can you not blog slash say so I've gone without the one the one I'm so.
affordance I did change was I changed my keyboard shortcut in Raycast.
In Raycast I would always type fan for Fantastical to load.
Fan man in the stand.
That is so ingrained in me that I realized that I would type fan and something random would come up because Fantastical was no longer there.
So I reconfigured it so much now when I type fan busy cow.
It's a response.
I type fan and the first match is busy cow.
I just did it now.
I'm going to propose something radical.
Look, Andrew, you take your mouse or trackpad and you move the pointer
to the icon that aligns with the app that you're using rather than
typing and even more abstract instead of characters that do not even represent the thing that you're talking about.
I ain't got no time for that.
Hands on the keyboard.
Are you using, are you using, are you using Emacs or Vim key bindings to do this FAN to BusyCal?
Which, which.
No, it's a feature, it's a feature in Raycast, man.
You can just set a trigger.
So that's what I did.
Is this org mode?
We're using org mode now.
Sorry, this is very basic that probably gives away a lot on my Mac
I am pretty much using busy cow as part of setup if you're interested in setup
Just go to Canyon blog slash save you'll find a referral code. You can try it yourself
That is you that's - that's that is - like
That flow is too smooth. I hate how smooth that flow is of you. That's what he says to his kids in the morning
It's like, would you like some Cheerios?
Or could I recommend that you visit Setapp
through canyon.blog/save,
and you'll find a referral code to the newest serial.
- I think he's putting like little cards in their lunch
that has like a QR code on it
for like the teacher to like hand out or something.
- That's a good idea.
So anyway, so BusyCal is probably won the war
on the desktop.
I will, and I'll secondarily use Calendar
if I feel like I need to secondarily use a calendar.
And thirdly, I'll use fast mails built-in calendar,
which is my calendar backend, if I need a third option.
So I'm living with that, that's fine.
On the iOS devices,
I'm sort of a little bit in number of camps.
I'm trying busy Cal there.
I'm trying calendar 366.
I'm trying time page.
But guys, huge news.
Overall, apart from a couple of minor annoyances, the default Apple supplied calendar app is not terrible.
No sh*t.
Whoa.
Whoa.
It is not terrible.
Oh my goodness.
It has quite a lot of stuff.
I know.
It can pre-populate locations.
It's quite clever about that.
When you do do a location, it puts a nice, very quickly puts that nice little map and a street view thing.
Turns out.
It's, it looks like a calendar, which is also very helpful.
Whoa, what?
Does it have all the days and everything?
It does.
I mean, sand stitching nowadays, but you can imagine that if you will.
There's a couple of things I don't like about how, you know, the way that it presents a
day view and then suddenly you jump out to a month view and it's a bit, I would like
to see those more merged rather than individual viewpoints.
But overall, got to say, Calendar, big thumbs up.
You heard it here last, folks.
Host of Hemispheric Views Andrew Canyon is the new Mr Default.
All that to say is that I think I don't need Fantastical and the idea that they put
it, they've only got themselves to blame.
If they hadn't moved their pricing I would have just subscribed again.
They increased their pricing and it wasn't for me anymore so I moved on and I'm quite
happy.
And are you typing in FAN to open calendar now?
No, no, it's still busy.
On the Mac I still prefer Busycal I think.
All right, so you're still gonna have that split.
And the final thing, the final thing I've got to say is all of this, my booking system,
again, I was using cal.com linked back to Fastmail.
I suddenly realized I kept getting people booking meetings in times that are already
filled with events.
Not ideal.
It seems like not how that's supposed to work, but okay.
Exactly.
So I've kind of moved on from that.
My continual search for booking apps carries forward and now I've moved on to simply meet.me
and that seems to actually work.
And what does that cost?
I'm using the free version.
Ah, okay.
Because I'm happy to be the product.
Because if you're not paying to book your meetings, you are the meeting product.
They seem to offer a referral code system so there was really no point in me buying
it.
That's out. Yeah. If you're not offering a payment in which I can get a referral,
you are not on my canyon.blog/save platform.
So there you go. Follow up at the end of the show.
Follow up on from a previous show.
Calendar.app.
There it is.
