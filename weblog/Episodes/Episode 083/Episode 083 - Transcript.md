*Nut bar music*
You should just get started because I'm gonna munch on my nut bar here, which could cause noise.
What do you got? What kind?
Peanut and cashew with real milk chocolate.
Whoa, none of that fake stuff here.
I'm glad they qualified it. It's not carob.
While Martin 8 can I do I'm can I do grooming corner.
Yes.
Cuz I've been concerned as hell but yes I've been experimenting with my look.
And I've been trying to get feedback from people but I never feel like I'm getting honesty from anybody and I know that I can trust the two of you for complete and utter honesty.
So I had my beard was getting pretty pushy and then in a peak of excitement I shaved my beard off but left my moustache.
So I'm currently rocking like the Ted Lesso Ron Burgundy kind of look.
I'm just curious guys is this something I should persevere with or should I get rid of it ASAP.
I'm ok so first question is if it goes away do we what are we left are we left with nothing or what's the alternative here.
I have to burn it to the ground ground zero clean face and then build up again and probably go back to the beard.
Okay, okay
Then I'm gonna give that a yes, let's do that
I I I would go with that for sure and we will have to see you in between those that correct
So we'll have to see like whatever is underneath there
In the meantime, okay. Yeah. All right. Okay. So you're saying burn it down. All right
I I just I think I think the beard for you is
It's a classic Andrew. I'm just gonna say it's it's it's timeless
Everyone loves it but the real question is do you love it.
I just get bored with it sometimes.
And sometimes I think it's just time to change it up and who am I really am I beard guy.
And I thought well maybe I'm a mustache guy.
I don't think you're mustache guy I'm just gonna say I don't think so I think we've tried it we tried it.
You know it's everything's worth a try but I think we could probably go back if we appreciate my honesty thank you.
Well I'm gonna say the opposite and say that you should keep the mustache only.
And I say that because Jason's right I don't think you're a mustache guy but the longer you keep it.
The more you will become and I'm very interested to say I'm very interested to see how the longer you keep it.
The more various aspects of your personality or dress sense or things that you do or say will adapt to fit.
Being the mustache guy so I reckon you should lean into it and I want to see who you become.
Okay.
Over time.
So the mustache is in fact in the long game is what you're saying.
Yeah, because if you look at a Ron Burgundy or a Ted Lasso, a lot of what makes those characters, those characters is tied into the mustache.
So there's an untapped potential for who Andrew could be with a constant upper lip brush in his life.
Okay.
Okay.
Wow.
I do know last night I went to a basketball game last night just as a member of the crowd and there was another guy and I saw him with a mustache and I felt that we looked each other in my eye contact and it was just kind of the quiet.
Yeah the nod.
You have a facial hair bromance.
Yeah.
You're a little mustache waved at the other little mustache.
It was a moment you had to be there.
Okay.
You bristled with someone else across the court.
Thank you guys I appreciate that we've never had grooming corner so.
Jason.
Yes sir have you been changing your computer set up again.
As often as possible but I think this is the last time.
We've had that before.
(laughing)
Bullshit.
(laughing)
Hey, no I'm serious.
I decided that after going all in on laptops,
I'm all in on desktops.
(laughing)
For the next four months.
(laughing)
It's too real, stop it, I feel attacked.
(laughing)
Ah, that accent was excellent.
Yes, I did change things again.
minor change, I'm still on the laptop, Martin,
and everything is lovely.
And I think I will be keeping this for quite some time,
given that it has a moderate spec attached to it.
It's fantastic.
But I think the more fantastic thing
was that there's a little known tool.
I don't think anyone's really talking about this.
I think it's new even, it might be new in Ventura,
I'm not sure.
It's called Migration Assistant.
Have either of you heard of that?
- Yeah, it helps you get a visa.
When you need it, you're traveling into a country,
you get a Migration Assistant.
- Yep, it's like the Apple card for credit cards.
This is the one that gets you into other countries.
No, actually it's not.
Migration Assistant transfers from one computer to another.
I've been using a Mac for going on 25 years,
never used it in my entire life.
I was always a cloner guy, right?
Where you do the big clone for 700 hours,
hope that it actually worked,
and then bring it over to the other machine
for another 700 hours, boot up,
and it like, "Meh, maybe it works."
Migration Assistant, it took, I think,
maybe an hour and a half at the most
to go from one computer to the other,
directly attached, Thunderbolt, whatever.
It was like a dream.
I turned it on.
Everything was just perfect.
It was all there.
There was a handful of things that I had to do.
I log in here, a slight preference change there,
but wow, really, really good.
Could not recommend it higher.
I already don't clone anymore, but after doing this,
I would never do a clone again
'cause it's just, it works so incredibly well.
Have either of you ever used it in any recent timeframe?
- Yeah, the funny thing is that I've only ever used
migration assistant.
I've never once climbed anything.
And that might just be to do with growing up
with the Mac from childhood differently
or succumbing to Apple's marketing messaging.
- You're Mr. Default, Martin.
You take the world trodden pathway.
- That's true.
Totally unadventurous.
Just do what Apple says.
Thanks very much.
- Well, you did right because it is fantastic.
And I highly recommend if anybody needs to move
from one computer to another, do that.
- When I used Migration Assistant number of years ago,
I remember having some sort of problems with username.
It was like, oh, you already have user Andrew
on this computer, you can't have user Andrew over here.
So I had to create like an Andrew Canyon.
- That was the beauty of this is that the new machine,
I didn't even do anything with it.
I just opened it, attached to the other computer
and it did everything.
I didn't have to do anything with the new one.
It was crazy.
- That's amazing.
- That shows you how many files there are to transfer.
And it was something like 3 million files or something,
like not unexaggerated millions of files.
And the whole time I'm just thinking like,
what the hell are all these files?
How are there that many files in here?
And how on earth does this computer keep them straight?
I don't understand.
But the fact that it does that alone
can keep 3 million files in some kind of order
where the thing actually works every day.
- Amazing.
- IPFS baby.
- I love it, I love it.
So yeah, new laptop, bunch of new stickers,
migration assistant, new laptop is,
it's just amazing.
- Are you gonna tell us what it is?
- Oh, sorry.
(laughing)
It is an Acer Aspire 7.
No, it is a, it's a MacBook Pro, surprise, surprise.
I know you both were thinking I was gonna go Windows,
but I didn't.
16-inch MacBook Pro
M2
max
Which is the I think it's like 12 core CPU
Some like 38 core GPU some crazy number. It has RAM. Mm-hmm. It has
96 gigabytes of RAM. Oh my goodness, really and a 2 terabyte SSD Wow
Yeah, so this is like this is the long haul like this thing's gonna last for six months at least at least
Six to twelve months, but the question is this is the most important question
Did you buy the USB superdrive to go with it? I already have one so I didn't get it
Okay, that's good. But we do have one already USB a of course
So I have to have to adapt that down but so Jason, can you do me a favor? Can you create a spreadsheet?
Put the date of acquisition of the new computer. No, the total price the total price and
Just start tracking
Okay, this is you the beginning of a depreciation
Spreadsheet. I don't think that's I
Could give you the numbers if you would like to track it for me. Maybe I should actually that's a good idea
I've got my spreadsheet. I'll just duplicate it put another tab. This is a business opportunity Andrew
You could be charging to track other people's depreciation you could be my my DAS my depreciation as a service
I'm liking this a business opportunity
I think it's a great specialist on the end then you can have ass in that word and that would be even better
Good call you're the DAS. I would be willing to pay upwards of 99 cents a year for this service. So, okay
Like just just to give you some perspective
Please.
So my iMac which I've now relegated to second device, that's still costing me $18.28 a week.
Why do you make it so not fun for yourself?
Why do you highlight your own monetary misery every day?
I know.
It keeps me grounded.
It's soul crushing.
Whatever.
I've had this computer for 181 weeks and it's just now been demoted to second.
But it's still $18 a week in expense, in cost.
Okay, here's a question for you.
Let's see if you can make sense, make a story out of these data that you've collected.
You said, "Interestingly, it's only become a secondary device after 181 weeks."
How is that depreciation performance relative to other computers that have been demoted due to an upgrade?
Basically it's a good point so I quite remember 29 so it's run for three and a half years that's kinda 181 weeks with that to be right three and a half years thank you.
Sure I believe standard appreciation for computer varies used to be three years I was done sometimes nowadays it's more five years.
I think if you talk in a Mac machine you can get a full life Mac seven years I'm gonna go out there now an accountant would disagree with that.
That was a no no no no no seven years too long but I think a modern Mac.
Easily will last that long so I'm only halfway through my depreciate food appreciation of the iMac.
You got such a much longer answer out of that and I thought you were gonna get so is it fair to say that in your own efforts to track and mitigate depreciation by upgrading earlier you have.
exacerbated the depreciation for your own personal experience by making what would have otherwise been a longer lasting primary machine a secondary machine that is less useful.
Um so yeah so now I'm on my M1 I acquired the M1 on the 15th of December 2020 that's an early Christmas present for myself that's at 123 weeks it's currently coming in at just $15.65 so the M1.
Is already cheaper than the Intel iMac it's just a cost of a screen is that monitors the big screen that really sets that price up.
So that was topic 1.
And that was answered like a politician well done.
I know it's like what were I don't even I just I'm just gonna nod and say.
What are you doing to deal with this issue Andrew well let me tell you by answering about a separate issue.
Yeah. It's a question. There's no requirement to answer a question.
Okay. Can I move to the next topic now?
Oh, the one that's actually on our agenda?
Yeah. Yeah. Can we backpedal out of depreciation corner and talk about something else?
People like depreciation corner.
People do like that. Yes.
And I will say-
I'm pretty sure Michael Furstenberg just had a car accident listening to it.
Probably. Sorry about that.
Just for anyone who's unsure, we've had reports from some devoted listeners that you shouldn't
listen to this podcast while driving because it can be a safety issue. So, thank you, Michael,
for that top tip. Yeah, otherwise known as "thirsty". Okay, next time... Jason? Are you there?
We've lost him. Yep. Nope, we're good. Don't worry about that. That's a later me problem.
Yeah, next topic.
Okay, so everybody knows about the internet and this thing that happens on the internet that people refer to as the quote
EDC or everyday carry which is usually seen as
photographs of like
47 items
perfectly laid out
like I
I would love to think that people are really carrying around that much shit every day, but that's not what we're here to talk about.
It's an excuse to talk about the backpack that you use to carry all of it.
I guess so. I guess so.
Which I'm not here to like rain on anyone's parade or anything like, you know, I like looking at those like the next person.
I like seeing all the little things, but that's not what we're here to talk about.
I don't really care about that.
What I'm actually curious about is if either of you have,
well, I know you do, but like,
what items do you genuinely actually carry around
day to day in your pocket, right?
Like everybody knows there's a phone probably,
maybe you have your watch or like a digital watch,
Apple watch, Andrew's got glasses,
but like, are there any other sort of things
that you're just like,
I don't ever leave the house without these things on me.
- I love your description of the EDC cult, Jason. And I think if you've been on the internet for
any length of time, you will have been affected by this at some point. I think it's a phase we
all go through looking at this photo. And I noticed that every single American always has a knife.
I'm like, why are Americans always carrying knives?
- Not one, there's usually like four. - Why?
I don't know I guess if you like if you lose one and then you go to grab the
second one and you fumble it and drop it and then you go to get the third one and
then that one's jammed at least you've got the fourth one I don't know you all
took Rambo in first blood too seriously my everyday carry is very simple it's
basically it used to be PWK you probably know PWK phone wallet keys oh okay
that's just the way that's like the checklist as you're walking out the door
PWK phone wallet keys. If you got those you're golden. But it's changed probably in the last
couple of years, last year I'd say it is no longer PWK. Now it is PWK
phone watch keys. Oh okay. You see what I'm doing there? I see that you swapped one W
for a different W. - Yeah.
- Keeping it still PWK.
- Exactly.
- Got it.
- So you've done a grep command.
Would you use grep to do that, Jason?
- I would use a switcheroo.
- Okay, all right.
So PWK, phone watch key.
- Pseudo switcheroo though, 'cause yeah, go ahead.
- Should be pseudo, really.
'Cause it's super user do, not super user do.
Sudoku?
- Oh my goodness.
- No, Wordle.
- I subscribed to the New York Times again,
so I could play Wordle on the crossword.
I sometimes still need my wallet,
but rarely these days do I need it.
So my wallet is basically now my watch.
I Apple Pay with my watch like a madman.
I much prefer using Apple Pay on the watch than the phone,
because the authentication is so much easier.
So I'm just like waving my wrist around
All over the place when I'm out in the world paying for stuff.
So that is more.
What do you mean it's easier?
The authentication process.
I sometimes feel like when I'm authenticating to pay, I'm never quite certain of the flow of when I need to look at my phone to make sure it validates it's me.
Whereas your watch is always, for as long as it stays on your wrist, it's authenticated.
Click, click, swipe, done.
Yep.
Yep.
So I love that.
And you can also choose different cards and stuff on your watch.
So if you're like, "Oh, I don't wanna pay with that account,
"I wanna use this one," just use the digital crown,
change it, away you go.
Sometimes I will need my wallet,
like if I need my healthcare card
or Medicare card or something like that.
So I'm going to a specific appointment
where I'm like, "I will need a wallet
"because of all the cards, I will take it."
But gradually all those cards are now being transferred
to digital cards in the wallet app of the phone.
So I think the wallet is definitely living on borrowed time.
- 'Cause you have digital driver license, right?
Or no? - Martin does.
- Yes. - I don't.
- Martin does.
Oh, okay.
I knew somebody did.
Okay. - Yeah.
I think ours is coming.
- So what do you do?
Do you just say, "Screw it,"
and just go without a license?
- We don't have to.
There's no requirement that we have to carry.
- Oh, okay. - No.
- We don't have to carry. - It's the Wild West.
You do whatever you want over there.
- Oh, okay.
Interesting.
So side tangent then,
You get pulled over by a cop.
What's the, what does that process look like?
Like, what do they--
- They just pull you over for a chat.
They don't actually do anything over there.
- Oh, okay. Got it.
- They have a chat. - Sorry, Andrew.
- No, they ask why you're not wearing high-vis.
No, really, if you, I think I'm rarely pulled over
by police, but if you were, I think you have,
I think you have like 48 hours to present
your identification if required.
- 48 hours.
(laughing)
- Something like that.
But there's no expectation
that you would have identification.
There's absolutely no requirement
that you'd be able to prove who you are at any point in time.
- Come back in two days, mate, if you feel like it.
Otherwise, it's fine.
- We're very checked out.
- Meanwhile, you watch any American movie
and it's like, "Please remain in your vehicle."
And it's like, this is ridiculous exercise.
- That's interesting, okay.
- When you get pulled over by police,
there is a lot of mates going on.
Hey, mate, how you doing?
Oh, mate.
I'm so sorry, what'd I do, mate?
It's okay, mate, it's okay.
We just wanna have a quick chat.
There's a lot of mates when you're dealing with police.
Keeping it low key, right?
Anyway, back to the PWK.
So PWK, then I am old.
So I am finding that glasses are now imperative.
So I haven't really added the G,
but maybe I need to do like a PWKG, but that's awkward.
So I just try and remember glasses.
I keep a spare set in my car as well.
So if I have forgotten my glasses,
I've got last year's glasses in my car as a backup.
- Could you just put that little fancy chain on them
so you can wear them around your neck at all times?
- Ooh, I like that. - Like the Golden Girls.
Yeah, I would like that.
- Yeah, or the flip up ones like Edward Rooney
in Ferris Bueller.
- That would work too.
Oh, Rooney, what a legend.
- Rooney, oh.
- Could glasses just be a pair of glasses?
So then it's like P squared WK, would that work?
Hang on say that again.
Nine times.
Could glasses be a pair of glasses?
So it's another P so it's like P2WK.
Just trying to help you out here.
That's not bad.
Maybe we need to put that to the audience.
We can workshop that.
Yeah.
So that's my PWK.
No knives.
No weaponry.
Pretty low-key these days.
Okay.
All right.
Martin, what do you got?
My answer is very similar to Andrew.
I've tried to rule the wallet out of my life and I have to do that thing where I'm going to the
dentist, I've got to take the private health fund card and it just drives me a bit mad.
But what I will say is that with the Service NSW app, which is the thing that allows you to do
your digital license when you present it for whatever reason, that's great and I love using it.
And it also extends to things like if you have to sign into a venue like you'll know what I'm talking about Andrew might be a bit foreign to people overseas but like RSLs
returned.
We don't we don't have clubs or we don't really have those over here in WA.
Seriously?
Yeah we don't have pokey we don't we don't have pokey machines as well.
That's the other thing.
No I know the pokies are an issue but you don't have like a place.
Not clubs.
No not clubs like that.
So I know you got to sign into clubs because you sign in as a visitor to the club right?
Because you have members within a certain vicinity and we don't have any of that.
What the f- I actually, funnily enough, wrote an old lounge room and a blog piece about the ridiculous signs you have in terms of garb that you're allowed to wear to these places and how that's morphed over time.
Jason, you look very confused.
What the hell are you talking about?
Pokies and clubs and what the f-
Okay, so pokies is short for poker machines, right?
Which is a huge kind of-
Which is not poker at all.
No, it's just pull a lever or now just as you say, have a slap, press the button and things spin around digitally and it takes all your money and just sends you to a downward spiral of depression.
So gambling, got it, got it.
Yeah, that's bad. But that's not the whole thing, although it's a big part of it in certain New South Wales clubs. When I say certain, I mean all of them.
You know, a select few as in all. Yeah.
Yeah but these clubs essentially are just places where you can go in for a meal or socialise with friends it's kind of just bar/pub/family venue/small digitalised gambling area/bistro.
But it's literally a club it's not like a nightclub it is literally like a club where you become a member of the club so you become a member of the bowls club or you become a member of the-
And you must sign in when you enter and if you're not a member you should become a member or you're a guest of a member and then you have this strange conversation about where exactly you live within the recommended radius of the clubs blah blah blah
So it's like a casino and a country club mixed together is what I'm hearing
Where you're allowed to wear shorts but as long as you don't wear thongs in certain contexts it'll look sloppy. Singlets are not generally allowed
Okay so it's a country club that's in Las Vegas, that's what this is, I got it
Yes, but with none of the neon. Very, very, you know, not drab, but, you know, the every man's club.
Okay.
In the suburb.
Okay. But you have to sign in.
Which is the point of what I'm talking about.
Okay. So I will be Martin's guest at this club event that we go to.
Got it.
Okay.
You would be a guest of the member who is me, provided that I'm a member of said club.
Right.
Anyway, the reason I bring this up is because not having to carry a wallet around is totally fine,
because you enter a place like that and you've got the little vertical ellipsis in the Service
New South Wales app and you can go sign into venue, you scan the QR code, it passes your
digital license details through and it's great. Problem is that when you rely on that system and
like me, you don't like automatic app store updates, but then you forget to update and
renew your apps frequently, you go into a place like, there's a place called Hotel Oluwara,
which is not, let's say, a place that I would normally go to.
It's more of the, let's say, bar/pub/nightclub situation,
which has a volume of music that I would deem unacceptable
for civilised conversation with other people.
We had to go to the door to go through because these visiting family members
from Natasha's family from Germany wanted to go to the place.
And I've rocked up without my wallet and gone, "Oh, God,"
that's saying, if you want to use your license,
please update the Serve NSW app.
I'm in the queue madly trying to update
before I have this awkward moment with the bouncer.
Anyway, in the nick of time,
I have updated my driver's license
to be allowed to enter said building.
- Isn't technology great?
Isn't it just great?
It's so convenient. - It's ridiculous.
So my everyday carry is getting smaller and smaller.
I would just like to leave with my house key
and my watch on my wrist
and not have to worry about anything else.
But alas appointments, clubs, et cetera, et cetera.
That's more than you bargained for.
I would like my watch to be my house key.
Yeah. Those home keys are pretty cool.
I want to get one of those.
So Jason, my question for you with your everyday carry.
Yeah. Are you sponsored by anchor for this episode?
You're carrying like 10 different braided cables around for this.
What's happening? Funny you should ask.
A whittling knife.
My every single day things that I carry in my pocket,
which does not quite as hip as EDC, but that's what it is.
The first one is a little, well, I have it.
It's a little tool that has a little thing to open packages,
a knife, a little pair and a little pair of scissors so I can scissor things.
And then like a little,
American carries a knife okay a little like screwdriver thing so I can screw
fast together stab people it's a screwdriver chill out and then the other
one is a sharpie because everyone needs a sharpie you carry a shop not even a
pen but a sharpie sharpie no because pens don't always work sharpies always
work. Regardless of surface, you can sharpie that thing.
It's so low resolution.
Hey, at least you can see something. You can go right on some shiny surface with a ballpoint
pen. I don't think so. Sharpie. Always. So that's it. And my phone.
Wow. That is the most bizarre set of items.
What? Why? I can open stuff and I can write on stuff.
How often do you open stuff when you're out in the world?
Constantly.
Well, if you okay, I think I know where this is going, right?
So, Jason's out and about, he's bought a packet of chips/ crisps.
Exactly.
And he wants to cut the top of the bag straight.
That's why I have the one with the scissors, so I can open bags properly.
That's 100% correct.
He would starve to death if not for that item.
And you know it's beautiful about this moment it's actually looped perfectly into a promotion for one prime plus which.
One prime plus dot com.
Episodes 31 and 32 just out for those who haven't heard it yet or those who want to sign up and one of the topics that you will hear is Jason's bag opening.
And resealing philosophy so very good get on that.
It's absolutely ridiculous.
Can I ask a question as to why underneath this topic there is a stupid link to something that no one else can see.
Oh yes I can.
Before we do that thank you to Marco F for joining One Prime Plus we don't want to miss your shout out.
Marco.
Marco F can now listen to those episodes previously he could not now he can.
Is this the same Marco that was talking to us on Mastodon recently must be right surely there aren't two Marcos that would be wild.
Impossible. Let's see here. Let me go back. I don't know. I don't see an F in here, but
I will assume it's the same Marco. I don't know. Marco, let us know if you're the same
Marco. Polo. Fish out of water. Anyway, yes. Thank you, Marco F for joining us in the lovely
the area of one prime plus dot com.
All right, so Andrew, you've linked to something next to a basketball that we can't read.
What is it?
Yeah, so that was so we were talking about the everyday carry.
You'll see it's nested outliner style.
So that related to the everyday carry.
That was my notes because I didn't want to spoil the surprise.
I linked I linked out to another note. Okay in agenda the app agenda
Got it, which is linked to the calendar entry for our podcast recording. Okay, and I've written everyday carry notes, which I've now referred to
In that so now we we can close that section out then we can yes
And it's interesting that it links to agenda despite my transition back to Devon think which we may or may not talk about
so the rest of the agenda is
Is basketballs like all the way down so should we just step away from the microphone?
And is this become like a one-man?
Stage show or how do we want to do that?
I think you're totally right Jason because just to illustrate to listeners how extensive this basketball onslaught is the only thing that I added to
The show notes was please do a shout out for Marco F. And I've done that that that has happened
The only reason it's such a comprehensive set of show notes is because I looked at the other day and it was empty.
Empty it was empty.
I felt guilty I thought no we're gonna have nothing to talk about and quite often I'm pretty bad with adding to show notes so I thought I'm gonna step up to the plate and add a couple of items.
I'm gonna overcompensate the hell out of this thing and put in.
15 I am sure the guys will do the same they'll they'll do this I don't put their entries.
No cuz I saw it full and went okay we're not gonna be able to do this we're gonna step back so Jason I reckon this is actually gonna become.
The rapid fire Andrew monologue and he's just gonna blitz this whole thing super efficiently will be done on time.
Well we have only gone through two and a half topics in 40 minutes.
What if I what if I prompt you with a topic out of this pool to get things going instead of just going top to bottom cuz I feel like you've already rehearsed and I want to throw you off your game a little bit.
Oh, okay.
Is that sound good?
Sure.
That's okay.
And please.
It's dangerous.
Okay.
With it doesn't need it can be a discussion a conversation doesn't need to be a monologue.
If you have questions or feedback or thoughts of your own, please feel free to interrupt not interrupt.
Respond.
Okay, I'm glad we clarified that because I was just gonna just steamroll right in there. Okay.
How about we talk a little bit about LogSec?
You're a big LogSec user, you like that app quite a bit.
Can you tell us what's happening in that world?
I believe it's pronounced LogSeek.
So Andrew, just to be clear, you don't like interruptions, right?
I knew it.
I knew that was gonna happen.
It was like a hundred and thirteen percent possibility.
Shit.
Okay, go.
Such a dad.
That joke is still costing him $15.30 a week.
LogSeek, I've used that for a good six months.
It's probably been one of the...
That's longer than my computer.
It's probably one of the longest lived apps, notes apps that I've used in quite some time.
And then I suddenly looked at it the other day and thought, what am I doing here?
I'm managing plugins. I'm dealing with an electron app.
I'm spending so much time like trying to cross link to notes that I never refer
back to. I'm fiddling around for no good purpose.
And the kicker was when I tried to find something and I couldn't.
Oh, isn't that the worst? You're like thinking of this great system.
And then you're like, Oh, I'll just go search. Uh-oh.
And what's worse, not only that, that happened to me, I had a little Martin voice in my head, sort of saying like,
"Oh, information management. Oh, what about your knowledge base?" I was just like, "Oh, Martin's in my head."
It was horrible.
Was I castrated recently?
I think so.
So I realised that Logseek, it's just not going to work, it's overwrought.
And the Electron thing is just so ugly.
I get sad when I look at it.
I was like, this isn't for me.
So I thought, I loaded Obsidian again and I looked at it and I was like, same problems.
It's not for me.
It's ugly.
I don't understand anything.
It's just, it just depresses me looking at it.
I don't want any piece of this app.
I know everybody raves about it, but it just doesn't work for me.
You actually gave it a full try and used it.
So that totally makes sense.
You didn't just say electron and then quit.
So that's good.
So, and then I realized I still, I bought Devon Think.
Many, you know, and I've always had a Devon Think sort of in my life.
And it's mainly been sort of like a filing cabinet,
but I've paid a lot of money for Devon Think.
And I was like, it can do everything.
It can do notes, it can store stuff.
And when you add PDFs to it or something, the thing I found, you can add a PDF to LogSeq,
but it kind of just goes into the ether.
And there's no way to actually visibly see it.
Whereas with Devon Think, everything is quite visible, you know, it's like files and folders.
And there's your PDF file right next to your number spreadsheet, if you want it to be and so
on. And you can really visually grok it. And you can also take daily notes and cross link
and do your wiki stuff if you want to. I was like, why am I not just using Dev and Think?
And so I did a whole bunch of reorganization, set myself up. It's a native app, native Mac
experience has scripting services. You can get things in and out of it. It's quite amazing.
And it's just a reminder that it's such a good app and it's so powerful and you don't
have to use all of it.
Just use what you want.
And I'm using what I want and I am just really, really loving Dev & Think again.
So you just literally described Obsidian, but okay.
I probably did.
And that's the thing is, it's not to say Obsidian is bad because I look at like Jason, you're
right into Obsidian.
I look at it and go, man, that looks cool.
It looks, you obviously get it and understand it and make good use of it.
I'm not, I don't think Obsidian is terrible. I think it's great,
but it's just not, it just doesn't resonate with me.
And so I just, I, I just,
I feel like I'm fighting the interface cause I don't have to think too hard.
Whereas with Devon Think, I feel like I know what's going on.
I understand it and it flows. So I think they're both great apps.
That's why it's so great that we have so many options.
Cause I think that's absolutely true.
Like if, if one app truly did, if the case were that one app fit everybody, but
it's just like, you didn't do it right to make it work, then we'd have one
app in every single category and like, that would be super lame and boring.
So as much shit as we give each other for like what app you're using or what,
whatever, like the fact is that we have options and I think that's frigging great.
So I don't want to just make it like shit on you.
Cause you don't use my app. Like I don't care.
Oh, sorry.
I was just at the ultimate kicker is I'm actually found a place for obsidian in
the workflow because I'm using it to synchronize,
read what my read wise highlights,
which is then saved into a folder in my, on my computer,
which Devon think then indexes.
So I have access to my read wise highlights from within Devon think,
because there isn't a native sync for Devon think to read from read wise to
Devon think. So Obsidian is my intermediary.
Have you just tried writing all of this down with a Sharpie somewhere?
That's what I'm saying. Right on your forearm. Just,
okay. So log seek is out. Devon think is in.
Obsidian is doing some kind of weird background task for free.
You just like ignore, ignore them.
Okay.
That's same.
I've still got agenda, as I mentioned earlier.
So sometimes when there's this, well, cause I can't like it.
And sometimes when there's a specific meeting linked to a diary event, it's very good at tracking that.
And I can.
And then once you've done that does Obsidian index that through to Devon think or something.
No, but what you can do is you can get an agenda link.
That's silly Martin, why would you think that was a thing?
You can paste the agenda link into Devon think or you can paste a Devon think link into
agenda and get connections back and forth.
OK. And then.
Or you can use hook mark to connect them.
I've never like not understood English, but I feel like that right now.
Yeah. So then how did, and then OmniFocus I'm sure is in there for you somehow.
OmniFocus is still task management central.
And yeah, that's, that's not the only way.
And then you flirted with Zavala and then went back. Is that right?
Yeah, that's right. And now I'm into bike.
If I was going to use an outliner, bike would be my outliner of choice.
Wait, what? What is that?
I was just kidding, but he actually had an answer.
I thought he was making something up and you were like, no, yeah, I'm into bike now.
What is bike?
Bike is an outliner.
It's a very simple outliner written by the Hogg-based software guy, Jesse Grosjean.
I don't know how you pronounce it.
He did folding text and task paper.
And now he's doing an outliner.
It's Mac OS only at the moment, but he's putting his mind to an iOS version now.
It's very lovely.
Very lovely outliner.
less overwrought than on the Outliner.
Show notes and transcripts all in one place. Jason, what have you been doing?
I've been channeling my positivity into Devonthink, no, into Obsidian. And I keep all the notes
there anyway. I write the show notes every other week. They're always in there anyway.
There's this thing called publish, which is supposed to just take all my files that already
exist, poof, makes them into a website.
That sounds pretty great.
I don't really want to make another website.
So I tried it out and I put all of the show notes for this show in there as well as transcripts
of each episode.
They're not great.
They're machine transcripts.
So take it for what you will, but if the option is a machine transcript that's like pretty
okay versus me doing it manually, which is not going to happen for 82 episodes, I'll
go the machine route.
So I've done that and I've put them all in one place and now you can search each document
right now.
You can't search globally yet.
I'm hoping that will be a thing soon to where you could just go to this place, type
Andrew is mad.
And that would work for Martin is correct as well, right?
I think that'll just throw an error.
I was going to say too many results.
Thank you, Andrew. Very good.
Yeah, so I'll put it in the notes.
I haven't hooked up all the like DNS crap, so it's a nice URL.
It's still like a really long, ugly URL, but it'll be in the notes.
You can take a look at it if you're curious,
if you want to see, or if you ever, I don't know,
wanted to look for something in the notes,
they're all there, but just seemed like a cool,
there's not that, there is no good archive for podcasts,
audio wise, like you can't go to,
you can go to where we host our podcast,
you can go to each episode, it'll show the notes,
you could command F the page, I guess,
but it's not great.
And there's really nothing like that for podcasts,
which is surprising that you should be able to just go,
oh, also this is indexable too.
So theoretically, if you go to your search engine of choice
and search for something and it's in our notes
or in our transcript, it should come up in web searches too.
So it seems like we've been doing podcasting for so long now
why can we not search for this crap? So now you can at least for this show.
That's excellent. Well done, Jason. And you've actually just given me an idea as well,
because Devonthink can actually import entire websites. So I could give it the URL of your
obsidian creation, download it in its entirety to my Devonthink database, and then I've got a local
archive. That's true. Amazing. Yep. And they're all just Markdown files. So it's just a crap
ton of text files in folders. It works really well. I have a question. Why did you not do
this in craft, which is where we use, uh, where we have our kind of working show notes.
Yeah, I didn't do it there. Well, one, cause I already do everything in obsidian already
and that's just sort of where I'm at. And it's so easy to just edit Markdown files versus
like the kind of, it's not rich text in craft.
It's like a, I don't even know what I would call it.
It's like a weird hybrid, like, yeah, it's Markdown,
but it's sort of not, but.
- And it works in blocks like WordPress or whatever,
which is another thing.
- Yeah, it's just easier, I guess, at the end of the day.
That's a good point, Martin.
So like, instead of using WordPress blocks for my website,
I just use text files.
- Yep.
- It's just what I'm used to and it makes sense.
So, and it all transfers over to when we publish the show,
it's really about only doing it once.
I write it once, it becomes that webpage,
it goes to the show notes for the site,
it goes into the feed, it's one file for everything.
- Well, I think this is awesome because as you know,
you would have seen with really specific stories,
I do all of the accessible transcription stuff,
but I go to the lengths of manually editing the whole thing
down to the point of correcting punctuation
so it matches what people said.
And that, you know, obviously is done
for certain academic purposes,
but to do that for over 80 episodes of this show,
and then also One Prime Plus stuff
is just not really feasible within our working lives.
So the fact that you can do this,
have it searchable, work it out,
maybe we can go back and fix things,
it's just so much more powerful to have it rather than not.
And if there are mistakes, then we can fix it,
because it's live in that sense.
I think of it as a starting point.
Exactly.
It's like, I would rather have something than nothing.
And there's nothing that says you can't just go
replace this file.
If the tools that we use to do these automatically
increase in accuracy by 50% every year or whatever,
I'll just go run them again.
I've got a million cores now on my laptop.
Like it's no big deal.
Just throw a bunch of files at it and let it go.
So yeah, it's a starting point,
But I'm hoping if nothing else, this is a long shot,
but I'm hoping that something like this
would make other shows be like,
oh, we should do something like that.
Or the vast majority of shows like,
we should just do show notes, period.
Just put something in there so that it's searchable
to at least know which episode to go to.
'Cause at this point, there's just no way to know
other than going and listening to every single episode
to find that one thing.
So, Soapbox ended.
I think that's great. And I think to wrap up the episode, I think Andrew has dropped something into our craft note.
Andrew, what is it?
Yeah, I'm just hoping that actually, Martin, I was hoping you would read this because you have a lovely voice for reading.
Oh, thank you.
This is created in craft with its assistant, its AI powered assistant.
So I just thought it'd be interesting to see how well AI is working in response to.
I asked her the question, tell me about the Hemispheric Views podcast.
No, I get the most wild answers when I ask various AI things about this show.
So you want me to read this now?
Well, at least at least some of it, at least read the whole thing
and don't even prove it. Just go.
OK, here we go.
Hemispheric Views is a podcast that covers various topics
such as technology, personal productivity and life in general.
The podcast features hosts Andrew Canyon, Martin Feldman, and Jason Burke, who discuss
their perspectives on different issues based on their hemisphere.
Andrew is in Australia, Martin is in Europe, and Jason is in North America.
You're in Wales.
Bloody hell.
Okay.
The podcast also includes a segment called Story Time with Scotty, where Scotty shares
his insights on various topics.
In addition, the podcast occasionally features guests
such as Vincent and Manton Rees.
Now hold up.
(laughing)
I don't think either of these guys
have ever been on the show.
Apologies for that.
We weren't trying to exclude you.
And the way that it wrote this
suggests that Vincent and Manton
are either siblings or married.
Do they share the same surname?
- I don't know.
- Well, Vincent has.
Anyway, for those who don't know,
Vincent Ritter, attached to Gluon for micro.blog.
Manton Rees from micro.blog.
We've got Scotty.
assume Scotty J who anyway.
One prime plus members can suggest topics
and have their suggestions featured on the podcast.
The podcast also has an app corner segment
where the hosts recommend useful apps
such as a book track, a book management app.
Recently, the podcast discussed the different kinds
of sausages and how they are eaten
based on a suggestion by a one prime plus member.
The podcast is available on super cast
and features show notes and transcripts in one place.
You know what I find kind of disturbing about this? The way not only the AI got things wrong, but also kind of threw people in like,
"Oh, yeah, I know who they are." Clearly, I don't think it really knows who they are.
I've been thinking about where it got this.
And because this is the, specifically the craft AI service.
So I think it's a combination of chat GPT going out to the web, but also maybe analysing our notes.
It is looking at our notes and going, "What can I pull out of here?"
Well just the fact that it says show notes and transcripts in one place that's literally the sentence right above this.
I just want to know why it thinks I'm Martin Feldman from Europe.
That's amazing.
At one time when I did this it said that it was a show that was hosted by Jason Burke and or an American named Jason Burke and an Australian named James.
(laughing)
Just one of you.
I was like, what?
- You put Andrew and Martin together, you get James.
- You get James, yeah.
So, yeah.
Wow, that's amazing.
I mean, it was mostly wrong.
It had a few things that were correct, I guess.
It got the corners.
I'm glad I talked about the corners.
And man, the number of times we've talked about Book Track.
- Oh, we can't shut up about that.
Can we get a sponsor already with these people?
Geez.
Almost on par with sausages, actually.
Almost.
That was actually a One Prime Plus suggestion, though, wasn't it?
The sausage one?
I think so.
So that actually might be correct.
I think book tracking too, actually, by David H.
Yes.
So he's excited.
I think.
Oh, did we actually talk about book track?
I don't know if we ever did.
But this is why, Jason, we need your tool so that we can actually see what the hell
we've spoken about and know not to trust the AI that places me in Europe.
I'm disappointed it didn't call you Martin the foot Feldman.
I think that's implied.
Isn't it nice to have a computer that will talk to you?
