Does everybody have the new document?
- No, we do.
- I do, it's great.
- I do, it's adequate.
There's one thing that it's missing.
All text creation document apps,
probably 99.9 repeating percent of the time.
You're not gonna print this.
So can we get rid of the little fake page lines?
Would that be too much to ask, do you think?
- Yeah, I don't find the value.
I'm not printing this.
I will never print this.
No one will ever print any of this.
Why do I need the stupid little line?
- I know, especially when it's set up as US custom,
whatever page size.
- Oh yeah, I did that on purpose just to (beep) with you.
I wanted it to be-
- I changed it to A4.
I don't know whether that change has stuck.
- Given that we're using pages now though,
would it actually be against the entire name
Branding of the app if they were to remove the concept of pages.
Good point.
What would they call it then?
Infinite scroller?
I don't know.
It doesn't roll off the tongue.
Just page.
Just page.
It's just a page.
It's just a view option.
One page.
Yeah, that's all I need.
One page.
Keeps going.
Do you know the other thing?
I'm in using pages.
The other thing I found highly annoying and I didn't realize how embedded it had become is the lack of markdown.
Wow trying to do any sort of formatting with a wissy wig stuff
It's just so painful. I don't know why cuz it's still the same keyboard controls, but it's just something about it. It doesn't I
Just don't like it. It's a word processor. Have you sought help for this Andrew?
Are you feeling okay?
Cuz I mean there are people with
Issues out there things that need to be dealt with and then there's this which is a an order of magnitude worse than anything
I've ever heard. Well, it's pretty you're saying the markdown thing is worse, right? Yes. Yeah, okay
I agree. All right. I don't I just love markdown and I don't like the way it's sort of I'm just teasing
I don't know. Maybe I'm in my own head. I think anywhere. There's a little blinky cursor thing. There should be markdown support
That's my platform. I can see where somebody's cursor is just a little triangle
Who are we all the same color or a different color? Who's yellow? How do you know? How do you know?
Yeah, this is good podcasting to kick off. Oh Andrews yellow
okay, somebody's in photography corner, I don't know who and
I think every guy. Oh, hold on. This is great. Martin is blue
Okay, Martin's blue Andrew is yellow and I don't know what I am because it doesn't show me myself orange
Am I oh, I don't know. I'm just making that. Oh, you got me so excited
Are you in photography corner because I think that is orange. I am yeah. Yeah, you are actually yes
[Music]
Speaking of Orange, Jason, can you lead off the show with something a bit Black Friday-ish
that we've been doing for our listeners?
Black Friday?
Yeah, I can, actually.
We recently, worldwide, celebrated, well, celebrated is a strong word, there was this
little thing called Black Friday that happens around this time, this year, every year, actually.
So we decided, you know what, we like the idea of savings, we like people getting a
little something special during the holidays.
So what did we do?
We did Yellow Friday, obviously, because we're not part of the standard or the status quo.
We're all about the Yellow Friday here.
So we said, "Everybody who is part of oneprimeplus.com..."
It's in the long game.
You know what?
November fees, don't worry about it.
I'm kicking that right back to you, right back into your piggy bank.
It's all yours.
And you're just like, "Oh man, what if...
Oh, but I didn't join yet.
Shoot.
What am I to do?
Wait till next year?
No, of course not.
We got you covered.
Join now at oneprimeplus.com and what happens?
Boom, refunded immediately.
And by immediately, I mean when I actually go do it because it's a completely manual
process so it will not be immediate and/or quick, but it will happen.
So go join oneprimeplus.com now and get your fees back at some point.
Little star next to that.
Well, what a month for two people to join as well.
I'd like to acknowledge Pete M and Eli H. What a month to join.
Now part of oneprimeplus.com in the discord special new room has opened the door, the
- Golden door, no, golden arches,
'cause no one's using that.
The golden arches have opened.
- The orange arches.
- And you have been invited in.
The little velvet cord has been pushed aside.
Come on in, the water's fine.
- I think our doors, when they open,
I hope they make the Star Trek noise,
the sort of (imitates explosion)
- Hmm.
- Now I would like that.
- Can I go crazy here for a second?
Is that okay?
Do you mind?
- Thank you, I already,
just continue. Yeah. Tell you what, it's now Yellow Friday all month of November
and December. What the heck? You didn't run this past the Finance Committee?
November and December. Join oneprimeplus.com. Fees returned for that month. Okay, okay.
I'm just checking in with the shit. Andrew just had a heart attack. He is now,
you're actually hearing an AI version of him. We've had to replace him because
Do you know what though Andrew can I it's okay though can I tell you why it's going to be.
I got to talk me through this it's one month you know what you know you know why one month doesn't matter why it's in the long game.
Who and that just avoided a shareholder revolt.
We have shareholders.
We have one share in there and it's his.
When is our annual general meeting Andrew I was not aware of the shareholders.
It's just after Eofi.
Did I miss this?
It's between Eofi and performance reviews.
Did I have a proxy or something?
What's going on here?
You can nominate a proxy.
Absolutely.
I don't recall nominating one.
I would like to put forward a motion that Andrew is removed immediately from any business decisions for I was not involved in the annual general meeting.
Oh man.
It's an uprising.
This is terrible.
This is the biggest controversy since which note-taking app we should use for which I had zero care.
(both laughing)
- That was quite the escalation
from don't care to getting ejected.
(Martin laughing)
- Well, you know, it's about an annual general meeting.
Can we just settle this once and for all?
Like the number of times,
and this is a bit of an insight behind the scenes
for our listeners about the private Discord
that we use to run the show.
Martin just wants a pages document.
Martin just wants a dot text file.
Martin doesn't, all of the animosity about note-taking apps
and budgeting decisions was coming from Western Australia.
Couldn't care less what rectangle we type notes into.
- Martin, you know how you have like a,
I have like a little voodoo doll thing, right?
And it's kind of like, that's of you.
And I just, it's pins, right?
I don't know, somehow it's all your fault.
I don't know if that analogy holds up, but.
- Nah, not a note in the slightest.
If the voodoo was attempted, it wasn't really working.
It was more amusement than anger.
- So the key takeaway is go to oneprimeplus.com
and sign up today.
- That's what we were talking about.
That's right.
- Yeah, okay.
I thought so.
I figured that was all related.
- I'm a little hung up on performance reviews
'cause we did one of those a while ago,
but we're probably well overdue for another one.
- Yeah.
- Wasn't Jason the HR representative we put forward?
- Yeah.
- Do we have to performance review him
for having not done this year's performance review?
- That would be a 360 review.
- Jeez, it's getting out of control.
- Yeah.
Jason, if you could just submit your code, an example of your code to us for assessment
will determine whether your performance has been adequate.
If we decide yes, you can stay.
If not, we'll send you an email and remove access to the Discord at midnight.
Okay.
And as I'm uttering this sentence about how you've just been fired, Jason, you are already
rehired.
So congratulations.
Oh, it's good to be here.
I really appreciate the opportunity and I promise I will perform.
I do should know that this is now Hemisphere views hardcore.
Oh I'm out.
It's an adult version what is that.
I think that's the next topic that's what I'm hearing photography corner.
No I'm elevating a topic I don't know how to move it in pages but I'm going to move it up.
I misread that I thought Jason was going to tell us about his hardcore photography.
Please elevate a very quickly this won't take long because we've all been following the shenanigans at social media I just want to say I have exited.
From the Twitter platform I put a final post up and see that.
At still at Twitter at Andrew Canyon because I haven't totally deactivated because I'm just don't want somebody else to take my name not because I want somebody else I just I feel like I'm just sticking it to them by not freeing up that namespace.
The quivering as a result no doubt go Jason.
Can I ask a legitimate question.
Yeah sure.
So you said you didn't fully deactivate. I don't know what the Twitter situation is right now.
I mean I know what's happening but I don't know. What does it mean to not fully deactivate?
Are there different levels of deactivation? Or is this... What did you do? I guess is my question.
All I did is I deleted all the apps and logged out of the site.
But all my accounts still exist.
If you deactivate, it takes away your feed, and you have 30 days to recover it.
Otherwise it's deleted, and your name is then put back into the pool for other people to
grab.
Okay, got it.
So if you deactivate, and then in 30 days do nothing, I could then go sign up and become
you with no repercussions whatsoever.
Correct.
Yep.
That sounds nice.
Okay.
incur the storage price of some of my tweets.
Most of the old stuff I've deleted.
I used a service to delete all my old stuff.
So it's just recent.
I left one farewell tweet and I'm gone, gone, gone.
Congratulations.
I have replaced it with Mastodon and I just went, I love Mastodon.
It's opened me up to a whole new world of different people and it's quite refreshing
just to see a whole bunch of different, interesting people.
It has a lot of the same benefits as Twitter, kind of like an interesting feed of conversation
scrolling bar that you can dip in and out of.
But I think what I am enjoying is that it's not quite as performative.
People are just sharing interesting things, they're putting comments on.
It's a lot like the early days of Twitter when it wasn't being gamified.
So I'm enjoying it and I'm finding new people that I didn't know on Twitter.
It's interesting.
And just the technology platform is curious.
I don't know.
I just like it.
Is that, is that enough?
Can I just say, I just like it.
Haven't figured out quite why yet.
It's not a test.
That's perfectly fine.
Yeah.
Plus there's NBL polls that I can vote on.
Don't tell Nick.
Oh no.
Cause I feel like I'm messing up the results.
I just picked the team that I think has the best name.
Well, that's probably the biggest downside is there is no effective NBL community on Mastodon. The crossover between-
Because you haven't built it yet. Step up.
The crossover between basketball people and slightly more confusing tech platforms is not strong. So-
I would like to just stop you and say that it is literally no more difficult than Twitter. It's 100% the same.
Yeah, you're right.
There is this weird online narrative of like, "Oh my God, it's so difficult!" Like you have to go
write Perl code in a freaking terminal or something. Like, no, you type in a name that
you want and you're done. It's so easy. - I get hung up on, "Oh, which instance
do I join?" Like, "Oh, they've got Perls." It's like, "Oh, really?"
- It doesn't matter. Get on there if you want. Don't get on there if you don't want.
- Yeah. - Easy.
- I want to say something about Mastodon just quickly, because I've been using it more as well.
since, you know, we had Adam on, we discussed omg.lol, his instance there.
It's been good fun following more people.
I think what I've been enjoying about it, even though I had tried it before,
now that you are seeing more people shift there,
you're actually able to kind of find and follow people who you know.
I had less of a positive experience with it when I started that first time
because it was a bit of a desert, at least of people I knew.
So that's a good thing.
But for all of the positivity and the similar kind of function to Twitter,
One thing that I've realized in using Mastodon fresh again, while still on Twitter, the thing
that's kind of annoyed me for the longest time, and I never really thought about it when it comes
to using these platforms, is the reply situation. Now, you know, GlueOn for micro.blog by a good
friend, Vincent Ritter? Yes.
How he has that function in the micro.blog GlueOn app, where you can hide replies in the feed?
Yes. Yes.
Do you use a feature like that on micro.blog, for example?
I do not. I do not. I keep replies.
See, I love having replies hidden on that because you see the source or the original
idea of each person you follow, and then you can go into replies. When it comes to Twitter
or even micro.blog without that feature, and by extension, Mastodon, this kind of fragmentation
in the way that we think or bits and pieces of information lacking context, it's so nice
to see things on a network like micro.blog with replies hidden where you can see those original
ideas. Mastodon are now using this fresh I'm going through and I'm like that's boosted I don't know
what that is. Someone's replied to that but I have no idea what they're talking about. Who is that?
What is this? And so to me it's like I'm enjoying Mastodon but at the same time I'm seeing all these
bits and pieces of things that I didn't really want to see and it's just mess that I don't like.
So if anyone knows a feature or an app out there for Mastodon
that copies that micro.blog/Gluon functionality,
I'd love to know about it.
- The web app does.
The web app lets you hide boosts and replies.
- Okay, well, that's a good thing.
That might be the way to go, but--
- Independently, you can pick one or both
to hide in the timeline.
- Well, hopefully other people have learned
in listening to this mini rant,
if that annoys them, how to turn it off,
because in using Mastodon,
that's reinforced my love for glue on for micro dot blog
in its cleanness.
- Yeah, well, and no, absolutely.
I totally get that.
I think I'm less of a completionist these days.
So sometimes I actually cheat and I use the replies
because I missed the original thing.
So I'll be like, oh, that's interesting.
But yeah, I could see that.
But I know it's doable on the website or the web app.
I would imagine it's probably doable in the apps as well.
People just need to actually put that functionality
into the clients, but--
- I just find it reduces your scrolling
'cause you go, oh, here are all the people I follow
and what they've actually said.
And then that's it rather than what am I looking at?
- Thanks for the hot tip
'cause I've just made that change in Gluon.
And there we go.
- It's a lovely feature.
- There you go, looking forward to that.
So yeah, that is probably the other point.
Yes, Martin, I wanna pick that up
and I wanna make it very clear.
If you're not liking Twitter and you think,
oh, we have to go to Mastodon
because that's the immediate equivalent.
No, check out Micro.blog because it is amazing.
And in many ways, it is better.
It probably doesn't have that same power of the word getting
out on the street.
But it's wonderful.
And it is a proper blog.
And they're interoperable.
So again, it kind of doesn't matter where you are
because the stuff can flow back and forth pretty nicely.
But I'm still a happy customer of Micro.blog.
And I've been using it more.
That's the other good thing about Twitter going away.
I've suddenly become a blogging fiend.
- Oh, you are, yeah.
- Going crazy.
- A lot of blogs coming out of you.
- I'm enjoying it.
It's reinvigorated by love for the blog.
- You are a web logger.
(laughing)
For sure.
- So Jason, you've been taking some photos.
- No, actually why I added Photography Corner
was I wanted to, A, I wanted a bit of an update from you
because you have been photographing
with your new camera setup.
And you had spoken previously
about how you had your old camera
and you were still gonna use it.
So I was curious if that actually happened, first of all,
and where you have found the sort of
what pulls you towards one or the other.
And then I wanted to bring up the fact that
the camera on the iPhone 14 Pro is wild.
is wild.
It's blowing my mind in a way I wasn't expecting,
having upgraded just from the 13 Pro.
And then also, I bought a Polaroid camera,
which I'm pointing to right now that no one can see.
And it has been an absolute blast.
I bought it just because it was small
and I thought it was adorable, but I've been using it a little bit
And it's just like, it's so fun.
And it's more fun than I ever would have imagined.
So it was just like a lot of photo stuff all at once that I wanted to do a quick check-in.
So I'll start with you with your new mirrorless and your old SLR.
Are you still using both?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Okay.
And what brings you in one direction versus the other?
In answer to your question, Jason, yes, I have been using both cameras.
I have shifted the majority of my photography.
Like the one I'm carrying around now
is the Olympus OM-D E-M10 mirrorless.
I love the size and the weight of it.
It's fantastic for anyone who didn't hear
my initial report about it.
It's just a beautiful kind of pocketable camera,
at least with the 14 to 42 millimeter kit lens.
So I've been using that with the kit lens
and a 40, what is it?
40 to 150 millimeter telephoto around the place.
And a recent example of when I actually used both cameras
at the same time, kind of doing a bit of a,
I suppose, wanky wedding photographer,
shoulder sling kind of situation, was actually for work.
I've started using that Olympus camera
for certain photography or events at work where required.
So we had a bit of a community event that I was involved in
that had people from the local area
and other kind of employees
and board members and stuff in town.
And I thought, you know what?
We're actually doing this
in a really cool kind of aviation venue.
I'm gonna try using both cameras at the same time
with different lenses.
So I used the telephoto on the Olympus
and I used my 10 to 18 millimeter wide lens on the Canon
so that I could get both up close portrait shots
of people in the crowd and up presenting on the stage
while using the wide lens to capture the cool kind
of museum venue we were in.
'cause it was this big open space.
And it was a lot of fun alternating,
between different settings and lenses
to get the shot that I needed.
And I think it led to a better kind of overall impression
of the event 'cause you can get a better idea of the space.
So yes, I've been using them on and off differently
and at the same time.
And I've used the Olympus like twice since
for other work events.
And just this morning, I actually said to you guys
before we started recording,
I was doing peach picking with Natasha and Mac
and some friends of ours, like a 20, 30 minute drive away.
And I took the Olympus to that as well.
And it was beautiful for capturing the peach orchard
and the lines of apple trees and stuff that were there.
So yeah, I'm using it a lot more
and a lot more enthusiastically
than I have been my phone camera recently.
That's still a good thing to keep around by default,
but the Olympus is more fun.
- So we're still big thumbs up on the mirrorless for you.
- Love it.
The Canon's just a great thing to have as an extra option for when I need it.
Is there anywhere that we can see any of these photographs?
Is there a central source of truth for the Martin photography experience?
Well, the thing that I've been uploading is my dedicated photo area is the resurrected
account on Glass.
So there's that.
Some good demos of the Olympus shots there.
But I can try to rustle up some photos to put in the show notes to give you an idea.
Is anybody still using Flickr?
I still have it there I don't populate it very much though.
No I closed my Flickr account.
Did you?
Yeah.
Okay it's the one thing that continues to survive my payment subscription purge.
I keep paying for Flickr and I don't really use it except for uploading backups.
I want to try and get back into Flickr I still see it as a wonderful home for photography.
Yeah it's kind of hard I think you end up signing up for all these different things to share photos because something like glass for example.
is really nice because you just want to share that image or two, throw it up, it has the metadata
there, you can have a caption, kind of like that original idea of Instagram before it was completely
ruined. Flickr, on the other hand, it's like, oh, you want to have somewhere to put on more photos,
and that's really appealing. But then suddenly you don't use it as much because of that kind of
hassle or friction of having to upload a bunch of photos and make sure they're all thematically
consistent or well presented. And then you've got things like Sunlit for micro.blog. But then
As nicely done as that is it's like I might just want to use my credit or blog on its own to get the full experience not just photos so you end up signing up for everything and not using.
Anything as much as you should yeah I think I've been too precious about my flicker like I feel like all it needs to be the ultimate archive and it needs to I can't just upload one random photo because it needs to represent the entire.
History of me and i think i get to wind up in that just i just check random photos on it like it as if it were a glass or.
Instagram approach and i just have more fun with it.
I feel like i should clarify that flicker i love flicker i only closed it because i use smug mug who owns flicker and instead of paying flicker.
To just remove ads simply i would much prefer to pay smug mug to be able to fully customise and build.
The whole thing the way I want it to look so that's why I went the smug mug route is that I really wanted the full control and customization
Of the look and feel of all the pages and the layout. Wow. So if i'm going to pay for one i'd rather pay for that one
Then just pay flickr to have no ads
Yeah, and I get all the and their own but I mean smug mug owns both so
You know, either way, I'm paying them. And I understand that. But that was why I closed my Flickr account was because I wanted to move everything to this new
portal type thing that I wanted to build. So they're both great. I think Flickr is phenomenal. It's a great community. If you want that community aspect of photos, you're not going to get that in SmugMug. Like this is more about presentation than anything.
It'll be interesting to see a flicker with all this upheaval in social media with a and simply a tumbler is making a return
All the web 2.0 properties are sort of maybe coming back is flicker gonna have a big return
It might could be fun to watch out for
I don't think it would be bad. I mean, I think the more options we have the better
It's it sucks when we get into that scenario where there's only
If you want photos, there's one thing if you want blogging. There's one thing if you want micro blogging
There's one thing and now we're finally
hopefully at least getting options now, because everything went to Twitter and Instagram and like,
that was sort of it. So now we're hopefully maybe able to get back to something else.
Speaking of old things, making a return.
Well, I have my own Segway. Let's see who's better actually.
Double Segway. Oh, I just see Martin and Andrew driving in Segways down the street together.
I had my own Segway like boiling away as you were just finishing that sentence.
Oh, boil it up.
So let's see who's better. Andrew, you go first. You started speaking first.
Andrew, Segway. Segway A.
Segway showdown.
Wow. All right. Segway number one. In this corner, we have Andrew Segway. Go.
Speaking of old things making a return, Jason, I understand you have got an
old keyboard that might also be making a return.
And pause. That was Segway one. Flipping the tape. Segway B. Play. Martin, go.
Jason, Andrew, in all of this talk about Tumblr, Flickr, there's a theme. E's are missing,
right? It goes straight from that first syllable to the R. You know what I'm talking about, right?
Yeah, of course.
And that made me think, who else was unable to type E's on their keyboard when writing
a very, very angry letter about Ned Flanders? It was Homer Simpson. He had a whole letter
without E's. He needed a keyboard for that. Jason, you've got a new keyboard. Tell us about it.
Wow.
- Okay, look at this.
That was like, that was a Segway showdown.
And coincidentally, they both went to the same place.
I was expecting them to go to different places,
which was gonna help with the decision.
So, I think the only way to answer,
this is like choose your own adventure.
So I think if all of the listeners can hit pause
and then think about where they want it to go.
And then when they hit play again,
it will go in the direction that they chose.
I think we can do that now, right?
With modern technology, is that true?
- At Bono? - No.
- Yeah.
- We can do it. - No, we can do it.
- We can do it. - We can do it.
- We can do it. - That's to dump all.
- There we go.
Now, Jason, you will pick up recording
the rest of the show in a week.
(laughing)
Jason, you have to choose a winner, okay?
You cannot sit on the fence here.
- I would never sit on the fence.
It's very uncomfortable.
I'm gonna go with the segue that leads
to talking about my new keyboard.
So my new keyboard that is brand new to me
is a Apple keyboard.
So not straying too far out of the way,
but it's an Apple keyboard from 2003.
It is literally called the Apple keyboard.
So really easy to search for online.
It is, I think, model A1048, if I remember correctly.
It's the big, giant, full keyboard with the clear housing, the giant keys that are real
mushy that I think most people would probably hate.
I think people will remember it.
We'll put a picture, you'll go, "Oh yeah, I remember that when it came with like the
G3 iMac or something."
Is it the one that has a lot of like a plastic polycarbonate coating or something around
it?
Yeah, fully clear all the way around.
It's huge.
It's heavy.
like USB point two ports on the back
that are useless at this point.
F1 through 16.
- Wow, that's a lot of F and keys.
- A lot of F and keys on this thing, let me tell you.
It's got a button that's called help.
It literally has a button that's labeled help.
- Have you ever pushed it?
- I haven't, I'm afraid to push it at this point.
I'll probably close the Zoom call.
But let's just pretend that it does something really helpful.
It has the CD eject key.
- Oh yes.
I have a dedicated key to eject something that doesn't exist on any computer that I have.
So I've remapped that.
You haven't pushed that.
Okay.
No, I remapped that to be the globe key for emoji.
Oh, that's a good use.
So yeah, so I think it works out.
But I just, yeah, I don't know what to do with the help key.
I'll figure that out at some point.
But I remembered loving this keyboard.
I was hoarding these keyboards way back in that time period.
And I thought, you know what?
I just sold a couple of keyboards to the lovely people in the Hemispheric Views Discord.
I keep buying keyboards, I don't like any of them, and then I just have a pile of keyboards
in my house. So I thought, "Does anybody want these?" because they're just sitting in my house
doing nothing. They're basically brand new because I used them for 10 minutes. And a couple of folks
in the Discord said, "Yeah, I'll take it." So in the mail they went, and now we've got
Keyboards out of the house people are using them and I've got this thing and so far. It's been great. I really like it
It's exactly how I remember it where when you hit the caps lock key, it has the little green light
Mm-hmm, but if you're anywhere but directly looking down through the hole can't see the green light love that. It's a really good feature
And I'm gonna attempt to use this for a week or two
And if it sticks I am then going to get a touch ID keyboard
rip it apart so that I can make my own little touch ID button to sit on my desk
because that is obviously not a feature of a keyboard from 2003 and
something that is absolutely critical at this point. So that is my new old
keyboard. It's awesome to open something that's new in box from 2003 also because
the packaging from then to now is insane because now everything is actually just
paper, very minimal, super thin, like as small as it can be and as recyclable as it can be.
Now it's like, let's wrap this thing in plastic and foam and like all this extra crap that will
never biodegrade as long as we live. So that is my new old keyboard from 2003.
Jason, I have two questions.
Two questions.
Question number one.
Do the keys, when you push them, do they squish or do they click?
Squish.
Okay.
Yeah, I don't think anyone else in the world likes this keyboard but me, probably.
No, I like it. I have a couple in the cupboard, just not new.
Oh, sweet.
My second question. Oh, this actually, this build, this is good. Okay.
Actually, now I've got, now I'm building in a third question, but also adding on a feature
question. Okay, so.
Have you listened to this show before? I think you know the limits.
My 1.5 question is, what is the connector on it?
Is it just a USB?
Is it still USB or is it one of those weird A2?
What are they?
- No, no, this is USB, USB-A.
Yeah, it's not, I didn't go back far enough to the--
- It's ADC or whatever it was.
- It's not the ADB connector or whatever.
No, no, no, it's just USB.
- Okay, now, this is no longer a question
because it is now a challenge.
This was gonna be my second question.
People, long-term listeners will recall
that we once did a typing test where we tested our speed on as we typed.
A more recent podcast I was listening to ripped off our idea, just incidentally.
That was actually our idea first.
Well, we did invent, we did invent typing tests.
Yes.
So I was going to ask you, have you done a typing test on...
You're Mavis Beacon?
I am.
I teach typing.
Yeah.
Geez.
Sorry, continue.
So I was going to ask you Jason, have you given yourself a typing test on this new keyboard and compared it to a more typical keyboard?
However, I have not.
Well, that's perfect.
Now, Martin, you've just disclosed that you also have this keyboard.
Yes.
I think what we need you to do is we need you to get out that keyboard and we need a typing playoff, a type off between the two of you and to see exactly how fast or slow you are on these amazing keyboards from 20 years ago.
I'm open to that. I do need a few more days.
This is something to look forward to. I'm not saying we do this now. This is like an event.
Okay, good.
We're going to have the hemisphere use type off.
This will be like a Twitch live stream kind of situation.
In the next episode. In the next episode, we'll do it live.
Live.
And we'll do the same thing where, because I think last time we did a live typing tournament and the scores were a bit lower then because we were under pressure.
Yes.
And then we did one afterwards as the actual truth.
So we'll do it that way. How about that?
This is great. I'm happy to participate, but I will of course be using my modern,
you know, Apple keyboard.
Magic keyboard.
It's not quite the modern one because it doesn't have the touch ID.
It's just the magic keyboard.
Yeah. Yeah. I will use that.
I do wish I could take this thing to the bandsaw and chop off everything to the right of like
the return key because I just don't care about any of that crap over there.
I would prefer it to be the shorter keyboard, but that doesn't exist.
So we're making do.
I miss a numpad.
Hannah's got the full keyboard over there.
I wish I could chop this off with an axe and send it to you.
Because I just don't like how far my arm is mousing away, way over to the right.
That's what I don't like.
But I'm going to make it work and we'll see how it goes.
Other than that, I really enjoy basically everything about this keyboard.
It's just, it really is a joy to type on.
And if this works out,
if I get the Touch ID button thing figured out,
it's gonna be great.
I'm really excited.
- Would you consider becoming a left-handed mouser?
Develop your ambidextrous ability?
- That's crazy talk.
You can't do that.
- So usually I'll do my mouse on my right
and I'll do my track pad on my left.
- Yeah, as nature intended.
- As nature intended, okay.
- So that could work, yeah.
I could see that.
So that was my 15 minute segment on a keyboard from 2003
that no one gives any number of shits about.
(upbeat music)
- This was prompted by me throwing into the show notes
the following question.
What is something wrong that you cannot help noting
or correcting if you spot it in public
or at someone else's place?
Now, Andrew threw one in very quickly.
I don't think Jason did and I didn't make one obvious.
And Andrew's was the one that I thought maybe would come up.
So Andrew, do you want to explore that first?
What is this thing that is wrong?
It's very obviously toilet paper.
That is the thing that needs to be corrected if it's incorrect.
And by incorrect, I mean, it's-
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I just have to say, I am so incredibly excited to hear if you, if you both do this
Correctly or incorrectly
This could be like the topic for the ages of this could shut this show down
I'll just say that okay, this could end on episode whatever this is
72 based on this single
topic
So I am on pins and needles over here. All right wondering about how this works. Well in both
Western and Eastern Australia.
Bombshell.
Andrew does not use toilet paper.
It's bidet all the way.
It's all eucalyptus, baby.
We have to factor in the Coriolis effect.
What?
Okay, here we go.
We're setting up with with prior.
Okay, the Coriolis effect.
As a loyal Simpsons watcher, I thought you'd know this, Martin.
No, no, I know what it is.
I'm just wondering why it should affect which way your toilet paper goes.
Well, it's all about the rotation.
I'm worried now.
I am so nervous.
I have never been more.
There's been some really like nerve wracking points in the show where I'm like, Oh, what are they going to say?
This one is this takes the cake.
Okay.
So if I go into somebody else's house and I happen to use the loo and I see their toilet paper with the roll, it's going over the top.
Okay.
So I look at it and I say, ah,
I don't have to do anything.
It's perfect.
I was really, really, really concerned for a second.
Oh my God.
I just had three heart attacks.
If it's rolled the other way, if it's rolling under, I got to flip that baby around.
Oh, thank goodness.
He really worded it to kill us there.
Well done.
That was well played.
That really hurt me badly.
Thank you.
It sounds like we're all in agreement that the appropriate way for toilet paper to sit is over the top.
Over the top.
It's not ergonomic if you do it the other way. It's not just a matter of aesthetics. It's actually the wrong way around. You may as well put your left shoe on your right foot and vice versa. It's actually just uncomfortable.
You may as well throw your shoes into the toilet.
Yeah, exactly.
It's like if you ever gone to one like a public toilet public restroom Jason and they sometimes have those like
have that industrial size bog roll and it's in one of that.
Wait, so he defines public restroom and toilet, but then says bog roll as though that one is just totally.
Yeah, you didn't know what a toilet was, but a bog roll surely, you know.
Super politely starting I'm off to the restroom to have a bog.
And they've got the bog roll, but you have to get it from the, from underneath and you have to pull it out.
And then it's got that weird tearing mechanism and you've got to kind of tear it.
That is basically what an under roll dispenser situation is in your home lavatory.
Yeah.
Also one ply without effective perforation.
So who knows what's going on?
Then you just end up with torn bits of tissue everywhere.
Or like airports where there's one ply with no perforation.
Just one continuous like 4 million foot slash 90,000 meter.
You just end up like a mummy by the end of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're like, when is this movie going to end?
My flight is happening.
So that's a prime example of why it's just ergonomically broken.
So yes, over.
Oh man.
So much better.
But that's not, that's just one element of this question.
So, you know, it's like.
I know, but this was the most important question of ever.
For the entire show think how many people are going to hear this and will know when the show goes out because probably half the discord will leave.
Will get angry mastodon posts about saying the truth.
Will lose subscribers.
We probably will but it's worth it.
One prime plus is in the toilet because everybody will leave.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's in the Bob game.
That's where it is.
It's in the... Oh man, I thought for sure there would be an outlier here and somebody was going
to be flopped or something and there was going to be an intervention.
This is why this show is gone for 72 episodes because on the important issues we have
simpatico, you know, we are together.
There's a lot of controversy on this show but when the really hard-hitting topics come up,
we are aligned. That's good.
So what else? So Jason, what is something that you can't help to correct when you're in somebody
else's home or in public? - I didn't have a ton of like really specific things, but for me,
just alignment of things in general. - Yeah, that was my other point. Yes, say it again.
- Yeah, it's just like if there's some things on a coffee table and they're not aligned correctly
to my liking, they need to be fixed. If there's a bunch of books on a shelf, let's say, and they're
in various degrees of pushed backedness, they need to be brought up and flattened out and presented
correctly. - Well, on that topic of alignment,
here's one for you that I noticed. When I'm out of the supermarket, right? Let's say,
Woolies or Coles, as you would generally visit in Australia. I don't like it when people leave
the shelves messy.
Oh, yeah.
Or empty, right? Or like you take the front one and then the other one's way in the back
and they don't pull it forward.
Yeah. See, to me, I've had to resist doing this sometimes, but sometimes like you might,
let's say you're reaching for, I don't know, you're reaching for taco shells, right? And
all the other taco shell boxes or neighboring Mexican paraphernalia have been knocked over.
Now, I don't want to present it beautifully and straighten it for the sake of the shop,
Like, "Oh, they're not going to make the money if it's not presented properly."
Like, I don't care about the shop. But what annoys me is that,
if this is obscured or knocked over and people don't see it and they don't tidy it,
are people then not buying it and you result in some slight increase in food waste? I know that's
the most ridiculous thought ever, but people don't buy things.
Or they don't buy it. They don't stock that anymore because they think no one wants it.
And now you've lost your favorite taco shells.
But then the risk of standing there straightening things is that people start to think that you're
You're a staff member and I don't want curly questions about where's the tiger bread. I don't know. Maybe it's sold out
That's true. The fronting up thing is something that I I don't usually do it in supermarkets
But when I was a young lad and I worked at liquor land
Front fronting up as we would call it was something very important to the store. Jason's laughing liquor
And so when people would one of my jobs just constantly roam the store and make sure everything was fronted up
And I always got a unique weird satisfaction from having
long fingers and being able to get two wine bottles at the time and just
grab them around the neck with my long fingers and front up to
to the depth of two with one hand and I continue to do this to this day as a simple little act of
unique enjoyment when I go to the show
I'll take my my wine bottle that I want from the front and then I'll just reach and I'll get the two next bottles and
I'll just pull them forward on the shelf and there's something extremely
Pleasurable about doing that in fingering wine bottles it's the best.
It's helping someone else and I think there's nothing wrong with that.
Can I actually have a winch about liquor liquor land for a second because I don't drink so I couldn't give to who it's about.
The place in general but they changed as far as I can tell their logo recently and I think it's the greatest mistake in a bomb and I should horrible so for anyone who's unfamiliar with liquor land being outside of Australia right.
2L's liquor land and the logo for the longest time was red and yellow and you have these two lines which were kind of like the half silhouettes of wine bottles that made 2L's.
Now it's not often that you get a logo or an icon that represents both the lettering and the physical product or the service that they sell.
Fantastic bit of design and what have they done? They've reduced it to a word with no iconography whatsoever.
So I would like to shout out directly to Coles and anyone who's doing liquor land marketing and say Martin Feld non drinker couldn't care less please fix and revert to your old logo really annoyed about it.
And that's like an example of something in public that's pissed me off but I want fixed.
I'm aging myself and that logo because I was working at liquor land during the brand transition when they went from their old.
It was it was an old to basically word word thing back then just a word and they went to that that stylized bottles when I was there and I got a brand new t-shirt out of it.
And so that was like gosh 120 years ago right and it was amazing and we all loved it and it's beautiful and it stood the test of time and when I've just seen recently them changing that branding.
I've been hurt.
It's boring.
It sucks.
And it's also, it's weird because if you see most logos that have kind of been flattened or changed in recent years to suit tiny Instagram or social media icons or avatars, they had 100% something before, like ahead of their time.
Square.
I'm like, what are you doing?
It was a perfect shot.
You're right.
Any, Jason, are you like, what the hell's wrong with these Australians carrying on?
I'm actually just trying to find the logo right now.
I'm trying to understand what the new one looks like and the old one.
I'm sure it's liquorland.com.au.
That's what I'm looking at, but they don't even have a logo.
It's just a broader complaint for the fact that everyone's trying to simplify these days and a brand, regardless of whether you care about them or not, did a perfect example of it.
And now they've undone it.
There's the brand. There's the logo.
Now, if you go to liquorland.com.au, top left, and it says Liquorland.
Yeah, it's just the white letters.
And that's it.
It's terrible.
Boring.
Wow, that is.
But let's see if we can find the old one.
Oh yeah, if you Google Liquorland, or DuckDuckGo at Liquorland logo, you'll get a much better, the images that pop up, you'll get a sense of.
So the old one is the two little yellow line thingies with the word after it in yellow.
That's it.
Hmm, okay.
It's not the world's most unbelievably perfect logo, it just actually communicates, like if you had that by itself, people know what it is.
Yeah, I think the probably the most annoying part is that they paid somebody, you know
$50,000 to go into word and type in liquor land in times new Roman. Yeah, we got it. I'm putting something in the chat
This is the perfectly and it isn't it's I think it's a it's a liquor land
It's a logopedia wiki and they've they've basically got the whole timeline and what I can tell you I can probably add
This I can tell you 1990. It's when I started there
They've got a 1990 question mark over the liquor land that that Instagram perfect square logo
So that yeah, and then that that was my era but 2008 to 2013 to me like if you look in that timeline
That is the refined
Final perfect version of that logo and I'm so glad that you found this because it makes me feel less weird
Talking about this because someone's actually collected all of them and
I'm a more of a fan of the 1990 question mark which I believe would be 1990.
Seven 1997 to 2008 that is to me that's perfect not only is it like square and modern perfect for this age but it was the first representation of the.
the out the bottles it also did this thing with it when it was help it switched into helvetica right but this was perfect for the time because you saw italicized and then bold,
everywhere on logos that was so of its time transfer in western australia continues i think to use that to this day they had a similar transition with trans,
Was italicised then Perth was the bold that was everywhere on logos and also they use the burgundy and the burgundy is representative of a wine.
Okay so it's it's refined has a refined colour palette just like you want a refined palette on your for your wine.
They moved to 2008 and they went back to this bright red which I didn't go back there just went to I don't like it it's too cheap.
Slight sidestep here I want to go into a very very small wine corner with Andrew and hear a little bit more about this Andrew can you can you tell us what's important about cannons.
Nothing important about them they're horrible they give you a headache the next day you want to avoid them.
10 tons I do have a thought.
I don't know if that's right or not actually I'm being I'm being I'm not I'm not a wine expert never was.
Are you more of a Shiraz or Syrah kind of guy?
Sirah, Sirah, Sirah, K-Sirah, Sirah. I'm actually more a Tempranillo or Pinot guy myself these days. I prefer the lighter reds.
Cabernets.
I was hoping you were going to say one or the other because they're the same thing. Damn, you ruined that.
Yeah, sorry. Cabernets are quite, yeah, yeah. Cabernets are too heavy. Just can't do the heavy reds anymore. Getting too old. But a light Pinot. Beautiful.
Jason, Jason's partial to a rosé.
Wine corner.
Yeah I'm pretty much good with all of it.
Was that part of was on the run down.
Well I don't care about alcohol other than liquor land this website is amazing by the way logopedia.
Doesn't have our logo.
I'm a while and she keeps looking like a pity it Jason there any other things that you try to correct in public.
The only thing that came to mind was the little screws in like wall plate covers so like you have a light switch or like a power.
Powered thing, you know with the little rectangle plates that go over them and there's the two little well here
There's the two little screws. Maybe you you all have different. I don't know
Do you have one screw in the middle or two screws to hold the little plate covers on that clip-on?
Okay, so we have look generally there's like two little screws that'll hold that on or one in the middle and they're usually flathead screws
Instead of Phillips and so I prefer when the little flat of the screw is all facing the same direction
Which is you like verticality not horizontal north-south
Not worse against the way because generally everything else in the plug line or the switch line is vertical
So to have the screws being vertical everything has a nice
Solid flow all the way down from top to bottom or as if they're horizontal
It's like this weird abrupt stop and then some vertical and then a stop and it's just it's disorienting
You screws would catch dust over time and then it would ruin the efficacy of the screw when you try straight through
Just straight through no problem. Yeah. Yeah, I have something to bring up which sorry isn't really hardware related or
Physical it's something that I've kind of gotten out of the feeling of needing to fix it
But it still does bother me if I say it and I feel like it's a classic one that some people
At least in the English-speaking world will relate to and that is people who write on signs
Without understanding how to effectively or properly use an apostrophe. No
Who do you mean write on signs like graffiti on signs or like sometimes when you see a cafe chalkboard or something out on the street
Something that you could actually and I would some or even like a if it's written in pen on a sign
Just like something that stuck up on a window and I think do I need to be that guy who carries around a pen or a chalk to fix this?
Yes.
No.
And.
You should always have a sharpie in your pocket at all times.
Sounds like a leak risk.
Never leave home without a sharpie.
And don't feel bad about that.
Look I know it sounds elitist.
No.
It sounds correct.
It's not elitist at all.
I just think look no one's perfect.
I make typos or you accidentally like when writing a message on your phone you write down the wrong there because you're in a hurry.
it happens, but if you're going to put up signage,
particularly, I'm going to question the signage companies,
so getting out of handwritten stuff,
if you're given a design to make a shop sign on an awning,
right, for example, and you can clearly see that there are
two or three errors on this thing, how can you,
with a clear and ethical and satisfied mind,
go and produce this thing, take their money,
and then put it up for it to be wrong for all time?
I just can't understand how people do that.
- The customer is always right, Martin.
- That must be it, capitalism.
All right, well, I'm gonna put a challenge out
to the hemispherians, particularly those people
who are on our Discord,
'cause you know I like to set homework.
- He does.
- In the ShowTalk channel.
- Oh.
- That's where I'm prescribing that this happens.
- Feel the foot, feel that foot.
- Yeah, it could go in photos,
but I don't want people to feel the pressure
of having to upload a photo if they don't want to.
I would love people to share in the show talk channel
of the Hemispheric Discord,
certain examples of things that annoy them
or things that they like to correct in public.
And if they wanna include a photo, they can do that.
Could be anything from the apostrophe thing
that we mentioned to light switches,
toilet paper and beyond.
- And can I say, there's a lot of people in our Discord,
but there are more listeners than there are Discordians.
And I would encourage people,
if you are listening to this show and you think,
Discord, not really my thing. It's a bit too... Discord isn't like...
It's not the young kids hanging out Discord.
Ours is a refined Discord experience, and I think you'll enjoy it.
So give it a try. You know, test it out.
It's pretty easy to set up an account, get going.
It's a lot of fun. - It's easier than Mastodon.
Well, look, if people want to share it on Mastodon or Twitter or Micro.blog, whatever, go for it.
But yeah, Discord's the refined hub, as Andrew would put it.
- Correct.
Like a fine Merlot that you would purchase from Liquorland.
- Look at you.
- Can we talk about the death thing
in One Prime Plus for December?
- Yep. - Sure.
- Cool.
Not like now, but just like later.
- Yeah.
- That's a great way to end the show, Jason, actually.
So for anyone who wants super fun listening
on One Prime Plus and wants to sign up
during this Yellow Friday extravaganza,
In December, you're going to hear about death.
So do you fear death?
Question mark.
Skull emoji.
Beep, bop, boop, boop, beep.
Do we want to stop there?
I think so.
