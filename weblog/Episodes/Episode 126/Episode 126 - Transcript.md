How is your M4 treating you?

How's that going?

Pretty good?

Do you know, ironically, I've hardly used it.

Oh, that's a good investment.

And how much is that, I guess, costing you to not use per week?

I do not look.

It's been a bit of an adventure because the migration assistant didn't migrate.

I don't know.

They talk about Macs being so easy to set up.

You just plug them in and go.

And it seems like every normal person in the world has no problems.

Mine didn't work.

I left it for like...

I've never used migration assistant, so I'm not sure.

36 hours and it just sat there and did nothing.

Died.

Had to restart it.

And then the restart had to totally reset it.

It was nerve wracking.

I have a theory, Andrew, because I used migration assistant when I got my M1 Mac Mini that I'm using right now.

And I thought, you know, it took a while, but it was a pretty flawless process.

I think your knowledge is in so many areas that even your Mac had trouble collecting all of it.

It was probably a circular reference in my knowledge somewhere.

You probably didn't backlink properly.

So that's probably what it was.

It was like, what about all these notes that aren't backlinked?

What am I supposed to do with these?

It was really weird.

It just sat there and churned.

And then when I set it up as a new computer after having to reset it, it seemed like it didn't really set up properly.

There was lots of bits where toggles weren't turned on that I thought would toggle.

iCloud bits and pieces.

And I was just manually realizing, oh, that's not syncing.

And you have to go in and turn it on.

Whereas I would have thought all that would happen automatically.

So something went quite haywire.

Yeah.

And then I've decided to quarantine this M4 from any work-based stuff.

But it turns out that I use my Mac a lot for work-based stuff.

So I'm still using the M1 daily.

Seems good.

Do you have a different collection of interconnected notes apps on each of those devices?

Yes.

Absolutely.

Right.

Yeah.

So I'm going to have a work-based note system and now a personal-based note system.

Heaven help me if I need to access any personal information on the work system.

It's going to be chaotic.

Air-gapped.

Can't do it.

Exactly.

Everything on the work machine has to be SAML SSO.

And it's just not going to work on your personal machine.

No, no.

So look, and this is why this is such a chaotic situation trying to get this recording set up.

Because I suddenly realized I hadn't given Zoom permissions.

And I didn't have my audio hijack set up going.

It's been a bit of a, I don't have any of my setup.

I don't have a setup subscription set up on this thing yet.

Oh my gosh.

Can you even go to Slash Save if you don't have that installed?

I'm not sure that's even possible.

It's a good.

I don't know.

What do I do?

Do I take the setup off the work computer and save myself some money?

Or do I upgrade my setup plan so I can have it on more computers?

Just get rid of setup.

But I need it, Martin.

I think I need it.

Just get rid of it.

This is my challenge.

I'm trying to see how default.

I can be now.

Wow.

Well, it has been a year.

So it is time for everyone to be re blogging their blog posts from a year ago,

which has been happening.

Surprisingly.

I'm still shocked to be hearing about episode 97 as we record.

What is this?

126.

That's just wild to me.

Yeah, we really peaked there.

And yeah, like.

Thanks to Rob for helping with that.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That was.

That's just.

That's nuts.

I can't believe it.

So I guess if you did one, do another one.

If you did one last year and just do one every year.

It's a year.

It's a holiday now.

I did one.

Speaking.

Oh, you did.

Sorry, Martin.

All right.

You're thrown off the order.

Let's do it.

The foot.

The notes are moving.

The notes are shifting.

Here we go.

Insert.

Off you go.

I'll just scribble what I had here.

Doing the edits.

Yep.

Off we go.

Yep.

You wrote a blog post, Andrew.

Let's hear about it.

Yep.

Off you go.

Well, as the only one of the three of us who has actually done the follow-up work.

I don't remember homework.

Should be noted.

I've updated my defaults post for 2024.

At the end of 2024.

Other people, valued listeners, one prime plusians, they've all been doing it.

It's not fair that they should do it and we shouldn't.

Correct, boys.

Well, I'm a little bit concerned that you labeled them valued.

Do we have under or unvalued listeners?

Are you creating a caste system within our listeners?

Oh, totally.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

There's um.

Oh, okay.

Proceed.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Jim Mitchell is towards the bottom.

Ramiz.

I'm liking Ramiz because he's new.

So he's up the top.

Wow.

He's just going to rank every single person one to N.

Furstenberg.

We do have a number of.

I love Fursty because he's like, he's basically me.

So he's a bloody legend.

Of course.

Yeah.

We do have a number of, if you look at the analytics, a number of people listening via

other.

So what's that about?

That's questionable.

So I don't know what that is.

I don't know if that's our analytics or what, but we'll have Andrew go through that and rank

those people accordingly as well.

Totally.

I think that's the capital O other as in like social sciences or social studies.

So it's really just fitting Andrew's caste system of marginalizing lesser groups.

So anyone who doesn't fit into those main categories is labeled as other.

That's an Andrew thing.

That makes sense.

Okay.

I was wondering if it was a new podcast player that was super hip that I just was like a

test flight that I didn't have access to.

But.

Turns out.

No, no.

It's a social issue.

I'm trying to address it with Andrew.

Okay.

Good.

Good.

We'll, we'll be better in 2025.

Yeah.

So is that it?

Did we just, were you just going to say he did one and that we'll move on?

So I did my default post.

Well, I'll just give the summary.

Not too much has changed.

Six out of 23 changes, which is, uh, turns out that's 26%.

So that sounds like a lot, but I don't think it is really.

I did just a, I did a quick scan.

Uh, mine was 26 out of 26 have changed.

So.

I think that's a hundred percent.

If I'm not mistaken.

Ooh.

Quick math.

That's a lot.

The two most impactful.

Okay.

So I just give you a, the two, a couple of the highlights.

So what I, so obviously budgeting and personal finance.

Ooh, you guys, you guys, you know how much I loved YNAB.

What's more important than that?

But I've said goodbye to YNAB and I'm still.

Why who?

Exactly.

Why use them?

So that's, uh, that's an actual budget running on a peeker pod, which is so

much fun to say.

Peeker pod.

And then the other one, the other one, Jason, um, just as a little, uh,

perhaps a little sabbatical warning here.

This is potentially going to be our sabbatical.

Look notes.

No, I have to say the word like multiple times in the same episode.

Uh, I've switched to, um, to, uh, obsidian.

I'm really all in on city and I was wishy washy on obsidian last year, but I'm

all in on it.

Yeah.

Obsidian.

Well, at least for work, all in at least for work this year, at least you have

the little star there of this year because next year I bet it'll be a different

story.

Look, obsidian is wonderful except I'm only using it for work and I don't want

to, I don't want to, I'm too much of a tight word to pay for the, um, obsidian

sink with multiple vaults.

So I'm just paying for the obsidian sink with a single vault, which is the work

one.

You could put two things.

Nevermind.

I'm not.

Nope.

I'm not gonna.

That sounds like a really good way to go.

I don't want to cross those streams, Jason.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

See, I just looked at my defaults post from back then and I can say, I think I

can say pretty safely that nothing has changed.

That I think that's obvious.

Yeah.

At all.

That's what I would have guessed.

This will be the default.

So there's my homework done.

Thank you.

This will be 2032 and Martin will say, yep, still the same.

At the very, at the very most he could say I was using mail.

Dot app version 12.

I am now using mail.

Dot app version 13.

Yep.

Yeah, absolutely.

So that'll be it.

There's that.

Yeah.

I can't say anything.

That's it.

I'm done.

There we go.

So get onto it.

If you haven't written your annual defaults, blog post people, you know what to do.

Get on it.

And then we can give Rob a whole nother challenge of like updating his tracking

website to have the version two defaults.

He's going to have to create some kind of diff system.

Now that can now compare 2023 to 2024 and show like percentage changes over time

and ups and downs and gains and profits and losses and all that stuff.

Yep.

Right.

Yeah.

I want some animated charts.

It's all about the P and L.

Yeah.

I want it to be like a, almost like a power BI dashboard and we can click the

different years and then just see what what's happened.

Man.

I think I'm starting to lose interest in our own show here at this point.

Was it power BI that did it?

Cause I think that has never been linked to.

So, all right, I'm going to, I'm going to end power BI corner.

I'm just giving you crap Andrew.

Honestly, I reckon if you want to do some spinoff member episodes about power BI,

power to you, but you're editing them, right?

Absolutely.

I'll just get power BI to do the editing.

Surely it's clever enough to do that.

There's no way it doesn't have AI in it at this point.

I'm just going to do it.

I'm just going to do it.

I'm just going to do it.

I'm just going to do it.

I'm just going to do it.

I felt like they could have done a third, but we don't get it.

We get two.

That's it.

So Arcane season two, I think give that a go.

If you haven't seen season one, obviously watch that first.

But I think Arcane is really well done.

I think the storytelling is really good.

The art style is super engaging.

It's so different from anything else that is on right now because it is animated, but

it's not cel-shaded.

I don't even know how to describe the art style, but go look at it and watch like a

trailer or something.

It's super cool.

It's super cool.

And very.

But what sort of show is it?

Like what's the, what's the deal?

So it's based off of a video game, which then, which is like a top down, like, I think it's

like an MMO type game, but this is a kind of just normal day in the life, but it is

this good versus bad.

And then you have sort of, ah, God, I'm so bad at describing because I don't want to

give things away.

There's the, the character arc of the almost bad becomes good.

In a way, but they're still bad.

If that makes sense.

Um, yeah, it's hard to, it's hard to explain, but I would say it's like an anti-hero.

There you go.

That's right.

Yeah.

You could say that.

Yeah.

I'll go with that for sure.

Oh, wow.

That's a loud cat.

Um, yes.

So very cool.

Very cool.

Art style, especially in just a good, good, good story.

And it's almost kind of nice that it's only two seasons because you get a nice beginning

and end.

And then you have this, oh, it could have gone forever or it's going to go forever.

Like so many things do now where they're like season 42, let's just keep this thing going.

As long as it's making money.

Yeah.

Good one.

So that is TV corner.

And I think, oh, we've got some, do you, okay.

I'm going to flip to you both to do the rest of your TVs or movies, and then I'll come

back for, for game corner.

So given the title of what Andrew just added, should we make him not last?

So he's next.

I think he should be next.

Oh boy.

Oh boy.

You guys have both gone robot.

The next of you.

Is that what this is?

The next of the next of Andrew.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Oh boy.

Which is weird.

Cause he specifically is calling out like, Oh no.

And episode specific episode.

I'm very confused.

And it's not the first episode.

Oh no.

I think Andrew is talking to himself.

He's like, Oh, he's just gone.

He's gone.

Okay.

So I'll continue.

Yeah.

He just left the podcast.

We're not joking.

This is his, his window.

He's gone.

He's gone.

Okay.

So I'll continue.

Yeah.

So the window has disappeared.

It's just Jason and Martin.

And it's like now it's three by two.

So Jason, my first photo is actually from glass.

And I think if you just check the link now.

Oh, I'm looking.

Yeah.

Oh wow.

It was taken by Jeffrey.

Oh, I don't know.

Jeffrey.

I've just made him up until Andrew comes back on the show.

And um, yeah, Jeffrey has taken a photo of what is essentially a landscape.

Oh, Andrew's back.

Yeah.

Okay.

Three by two.

Yeah.

Sorry.

Yeah.

This M4, I'm not sure.

You just guys both just went into robot mode.

It was just like when you talked.

That doesn't seem good.

Sorry.

Sorry.

Well, you're back now.

Back.

You're back.

Would you like to tell us about a single in the middle of a season episode of a television

show?

Did you finish all yours?

We just swapped everything around.

It's your turn.

Oh, okay.

No, we're going to you now.

We're going, we're keeping it in TV Corner and then we're going to switch back to Game

Corner.

Oh, okay.

Game Corner.

Oh, okay.

Game Corner after.

The Last of Us.

You may be aware of it.

It's a PlayStation game that was made into a TV series probably about three years ago.

Yeah.

I'm still trying to work my way through it.

Last night I got to episode three and episode three, amazing.

Just an incredible tour de force of television.

It was like a miniature movie.

What are you laughing at, Jason?

Okay.

It's got...

Tour de force?

Probably.

It's got Nick Offerman in it.

It was Le Petit Fromage of television.

There was a strawberry.

I don't know how to say that in the episode.

It was really good.

Really good.

Really, totally a variation from what I was expecting from episode three.

And I loved it.

Loved the whole thing.

Very well filmed, directed, produced, acted.

Yeah.

There you go.

So you're going to watch episode four?

Was that good?

Probably in about six months, judging by my pace.

Okay.

I'm confused though.

Wait a second.

I thought a few shows back you said you finally finished like season 11 of this.

Wasn't it The Walking Dead?

Oh, Walking Dead.

Okay.

Yeah, these are the other zombies.

Okay.

I was like, I swear you've watched this already.

Did you just start over?

I think that's why I haven't been able to watch it because I've just been too zombied out.

Okay.

I'm still trying to find the courage to work through the Daring to Kill.

I'm still trying to find the courage to work through the Daring to Kill.

to work through the Daryl Dixon extension shows and all that from Walking Dead.

I just can't bring myself to do it.

Well, you can switch to The Last of Us for a little while and then go back.

Just zombie ping pong, basically.

Just as long as there's some zombie in my life.

Yeah, there always will be.

All right, that's it.

Back to you, Martin.

Since I was a kid, I have been a massive fan of Wallace and Gromit.

Love it.

I think it's the best.

And specifically-

Wensleydale.

Yes, Wensleydale.

We've forgotten the crackers, Gromit.

Anyway, of all of the stuff that's been made, I think it's great.

My favorite, personally, is 1993's The Wrong Trousers.

Have either of you seen this?

Oh, absolutely.

I have a stuffed toy of Gromit.

Beautiful.

Jason, you haven't seen it?

I don't think so, but that doesn't mean that I haven't.

Right.

Well, that's not my entry, although I would add it as like an extra entry

preceding the entry I'm about to tell you about.

Anyway, in The Wrong Trousers, the whole premise is Wallace and Gromit are short on money.

Look, for listeners, Andrew's just walked away again.

He's leaving calls.

He's walking beyond the frame.

It's very weird.

So, Jason-

Oh, and here he comes back.

Oh, okay.

He's got his Gromit toy.

Fantastic.

Thank you.

So, the premise here of The Wrong Trousers is Wallace and Gromit are struggling for money

and they let out one of their rooms, right?

They sublet and this very mysterious penguin arrives who we learn may be a bit of a criminal

and they kind of get embroiled in everything.

Anyway, Vengeance Most Foul is brilliantly-

Now, we're talking like 30 years later, the direct movie length sequel continuation of

that short film.

Fantastic.

Super excited.

And we thought, you know what?

What better opportunity would there be to take Mac to his first movie at the cinema?

So, we got in the car, drove to Sydney, New Palace Cinema up there and it was part of

the British Film Festival because this chain of cinemas runs these festivals that we go

to sometimes and it was a pre-release kind of festival entry.

And we went to the first.

First session of the day at 10am because that's what lined up best with other stuff we had

to do afterwards driving around from Sydney.

And we got there and the cinema was shut.

That's how, like, how first session it was.

So, we waited and we got, like, the first popcorn coming out of the machine.

Mac loved it.

It was like, wow, look at this gigantic screen.

More ads than I would care for than usual.

Like, multiple of the same brand.

Like, do we need to see the same lady dancing around in this red cloth to, you know, support

some Scottish whiskey brand?

I'm not sure.

But anyway.

Once we got past that advertisement hurdle at the beginning.

Fantastic movie.

Beautiful animation.

If anyone hasn't watched anything from Wallace and Gromit, I'd encourage you to do that.

But at the very least, watch The Wrong Trousers.

Watch Vengeance Most Vowel once it's out properly in cinemas.

Great recommendation.

Great fun for the whole family.

Three questions.

Yes.

Question number one.

Did you see The Big Potato on the way there?

No, that's in the opposite direction.

But thank you for asking.

Damn it.

Okay.

Is there any chance to see The Big Potato?

And I'm hoping you do.

Can you take it?

Is this your second question?

Or is this a follow on from the first one?

No, this is a follow on.

Question two.

Is popcorn.

What's the popcorn, I guess, in your household?

What's your popcorn preference amongst everyone?

When you say popcorn preference, do you mean like salty versus sweet or what sort of mixes

in it?

Do you like salt, butter?

Do you put anything else on it?

Do you have things at your cinema where there are like other little things?

Do you have little things to sprinkle on there?

What does that look?

What's a popcorn adventure look like in Sydney?

Look, if you go to any kind of standard cinema chain in Australia, so thinking about like

event cinemas or points, not sponsors, they'll generally have salty buttered popcorn as the

default.

There might be some other ones that are thrown in depending on the chain or add ons and stuff.

This was a bit of an argument when I used to work in Sydney with the German office there.

I knew it.

I knew the Germans were entering.

I saw them peeking in from the left of your frame.

I saw it.

Seriously.

It was this whole thing like, why is salty the default?

It should be sweet.

Like they, for them culturally, or at least the people I met, it was like, you get sweet

popcorn.

They found it odd that it was savoury in Australia.

So I don't want to speak for all Germans, but the ones I met who were from multiple

different states and regions were like, no, we have it sweet.

So that's what they told me.

What I particularly like about the one, the kind of mix that you get at palace cinemas

is they have olive oil popcorn.

So it has that kind of savoury butteriness, but I wouldn't say it's as kind of, you know,

full on or makes you feel disgusting.

If you have a gigantic epic box, as they call it, we've got the small one that we weren't

going to have to do it at 10 in the morning.

But yeah, that's good.

And occasionally we might get stuff that you kind of put in a packet and we're having a

packet and put in the microwave and that's just the general salty thing.

But yeah, as long as it's savoury, generally, that's my preference at the movies.

Okay.

Is that the same in WA or are you sweet popcorn people over there?

No, it's definitely salty.

Yep.

Yep.

Okay.

All the way.

Good.

Good.

And then I guess tangential question.

When you get your popcorn, do you basically get through like half of it before the movie

even starts or are you good?

And you sit there and like, wait for the film to actually begin before you dive in.

If you had like the lights are down and they've even just started playing the ads.

If you had like one of those night vision, David Attenborough, BBC planet stuff, like

those cameras on me, you would just see what looks like this wild animal inhaling.

Gigantic things.

It's remarkable.

I'm not choking.

Right.

Okay.

Okay.

Good.

Cause I was going to ask, are you like, like I get a grip of popcorn and shove it in my

face or am I delicately picking out one at a time?

I take a trowel or a spade.

We're like scooping in.

You bring like the sand shovel from the beach and you're just like scooping it in there.

Okay.

It's like outdoor garden couplery basically.

Yeah.

Andrew say for you or are you a delicate picker?

No, I definitely chuck my hand in and try and then I lose some on my shirt.

And you're like, oh, it's good.

And then you're trying to try to hold a handful.

Cause you walk out afterwards.

You think it's finished.

You think it's finished and you walk out and you pick it off your shirt.

Yeah.

Yeah.

You got a bonus popcorn.

I do find it's a bit like a marshmallow challenge.

I do like to hold my, my treats until we're into the movie proper.

Very difficult.

And then, then if usually because the popcorn is so salty, it makes you really thirsty.

You've probably got some drink of a kind and you're then you're trying to manage the ratio

of consumption to ensure that you don't.

Right.

Yeah.

You're in the world of fluid before you still got popcorn.

You're in the world of pain for the rest of the movie.

But you also don't want to drink all of it too soon.

Cause now it's bathroom time and you're midway through.

Now, what do I do?

Like it's a whole, it's a management crisis.

There's an app for that.

It's called Run P.

Oh, when you should run during the movie.

Is that it?

It tells you, you can set it up beforehand.

You tell it what movie you're watching and then it will notify.

They analyze each movie and they tell you the best bathroom break times.

Like, so you don't miss a quick, you know, like a couple of times.

You don't miss a crucial scene or anything.

It's like, okay, there's just a bit of background dialogue, boring stuff.

This is the time to go to the toilet.

Oh, I don't, I don't think I could do it.

I find that mildly disturbing and offensive about movies that someone is like kind of quantifiably put.

I can't do it.

Just moderate your drinking.

I risk like hospital visit, like to not have to leave the theater before.

Yeah.

You know what?

It should be, you know how you have like add-ons?

You're like back in the day, you know, back in the day I said like I was there, like when we're talking Shakespeare.

Shakespeare in Globe theater and you'd pay your extra shilling or something for like a seat cushion.

You know, back in the day.

Because you were at a higher class, you know, back in the day.

I'm off to see Macbeth and I'm going to pay my shilling for a cushion.

They should have some sort of, you know, upgrade with the online ticket purchase and you get like a chamber pot under the seat.

There you go.

That'd be great.

Yeah.

Have you seen the state of the cinemas as they are now?

I think some people are doing that already.

Well, at least it's contained in a vessel.

I think most cinemas are chamber pots.

Really?

Not the palace ones.

They're really nice.

What was your third question?

Couldn't, could not tell you.

It doesn't matter.

Popcorn Corner was too enticing.

Yeah.

Don't know.

If I remember, I'll come back to it, but I won't remember.

So next topic.

Oh no, we're still in Media Corner.

I still have two more Media Corners.

Oh my goodness.

There's just been so much good media that I've been engaging with.

Do it quick.

You don't have long.

30 seconds.

Two games.

First one on the Switch.

The remake of Super Mario RPG.

Never played the original.

Sounds very weird to play an RPG with Mario characters.

How does that work?

It works really well and it's a really fun game.

So check it out.

Second one just came out on Steam and it works on the Mac.

So that's good.

Mac game, you know, Mac where everybody plays games.

Most people play games on the Mac, I think, is from what I can tell.

Mind Over Magnet.

Kind of hard to say.

It is a side-scrolling puzzle game.

It's a puzzle-y type thing where you have to go over here to do the thing to trigger the other things so you can get through that to move up to the next thing and you kind of work your way through it.

It's got a little story.

It's cute.

Very cute art.

Very fun puzzles.

Very approachable.

I think if you're like a kid, adult, if you're a hardcore gamer versus just kind of casual, want to play a little bit of a game, I think it works for everybody.

It's nice that way.

It's probably not great for people that are like super try-hards because, sorry, this is a game for everybody.

But good little puzzle game where you can just pick it up, play a level or two, set it down, come back whenever.

So really fun.

And if you look at, I don't remember their name, I think Game Maker's Toolkit might be it.

But they have a YouTube channel where they did like a whole from beginning when they first started developing it through like all of that.

And then they just released an episode about basically it's out now.

Now what?

Like how much do we make?

Where does the money go?

What does the whole process look like?

And it's kind of a tutorial of if you wanted to make a game and release it on Steam, like here's what you can expect.

And I really appreciate that they give the caveats of like I have a pretty big YouTube channel.

So like this part was easier for me.

It won't be for you and that kind of stuff.

They very much acknowledge like I have an audience already in this other arena and that helped me in these ways.

For example, they're like if I have something wrong with my code, I can go into my Discord with thousands of people and say, well, I'm going to do this.

I'm going to say what the hell is going on here.

And like somebody will probably help me.

Whereas like that's not normal.

But they're very just down to earth about it.

So yeah, double double pick there.

The game and the YouTube channel of them making it.

So there you go.

Media Corner.

I'm going to have to make a new theme for like Mega Media Corner at this right?

I think we just this is just Media Corner now.

I think we changed the show.

Oh, it's just the normal Media Corner.

Yeah.

The show is just called Media Corner now.

Fair enough.

All right.

So people signed up for change.

I'm trying to do the most here.

Change name of show to Media Corner.

Contact contact patent office in copyright office should be should be easy with all the links.

Yeah.

This is news that I've been waiting for for quite some time.

Oh, really?

Like I've just been quivering to get an update from you.

You have a new cable.

I do.

I have a new favorite cable.

Do you want to hear about it?

Yes.

I think I made that pretty clear.

I've been waiting for this.

So everyone needs a USB-C cable, right?

And you think, well, I'll just use this piece of crap that came with whatever device.

That's probably fine.

It's bent in like six different places.

Doesn't lay nicely.

Who even knows if it does data power?

I don't know what it does.

Who could know?

It's USB-C, the most convoluted, stupid standard ever.

But we have it.

So here we are.

So my new favorite cable.

My new favorite cable is, and I know Martin's just excited because he wants to hear about

the company who makes this, who coincidentally is our sponsor, Anker.

Their USB-C to USB-C cable, parens, 3 foot comma, 240 W comma, upcycle braided, parens.

What does that all mean?

Well, it means it is the nicest, most flexible cable ever.

It folds up nicely in a nice little way.

Nice little loop.

Put it in your bag.

It's three feet long.

Instead of these 72 million feet cables that people give you.

Why do I need one that long?

I don't.

240 watts of power delivery.

Woo.

It's a lot of watts.

Is that enough for you?

I feel like that's still not enough for you.

It gets me by, I'll say.

Okay.

Right.

You know, on a rainy day when I have no watts, 240 will do it.

And then finally, the thing that I love about this cable is that it's a little bit more

flexible.

It's a little bit more flexible.

It's a little bit more flexible.

It's a little bit more flexible.

It's a little bit more flexible.

It's a little bit more flexible.

It's a little bit more flexible.

And then finally, the thing that pisses me off to no end is I grab a USBC cable and I

plug it in to transfer whatever.

Oh, sorry.

This is like a power only cable.

Like what?

Why would there be a power only cable?

It doesn't make any sense.

So this one is, does power and data, not like 20 gigabits a second.

It's like 480 megabits or whatever, but it's fine.

It'll do what you need it to do.

But that makes it not like super thick and unwieldy when you're trying to package it.

So it's a great cable.

I recommend it to everybody and I will be buying more of them.

Thank you for that.

You're welcome.

Very detailed explanation.

And thank you, Anchor, for sending me 700 cables for talking about them on this show.

No, they didn't send me anything.

I bought it myself.

So we're just making clear you don't have an exclusive cable deal.

All right.

We do not.

No, there is no sponsor involved here.

So, Martin, do you feel satisfied now?

I know you've been holding out for that update.

Did you get...

You look satisfied.

Yeah, I think so.

I think the thing that was getting me most excited was his invention of the hyphenated

compound modifier upcycled braided in our notes.

And the explanation did not disappoint.

The fact that it's upcycled and braided and it was hyphenated.

How do you feel about the capital B as well on that braided?

Not great.

Yeah.

Also, not unnecessary capital U, but it looks official.

And it's a product name.

So I'll accept it.

You see, I'm not...

I'm not that.

Is that better?

I'm a Nazi.

I'm a grammar enthusiast.

I fixed it.

Is that better?

I can't see it because you're...

Oh, is that because your JB thing in the notes is over?

Oh, you made it an M-dash.

So I couldn't see it because your little avatar is over.

Okay.

So this is more dramatic.

Pause now, is it?

It's like three feet, three foot, 240 watts, upcycled, braided.

Whenever I use an M-dash at work, which is more often than...

I imagine most people do.

I think I call it like the Martin dash.

That's what I think the M is for.

I'm incredibly flattered by that, Andrew.

Thank you.

I do think about you whenever I use it.

Oh, Martin would be so happy.

And then you got to make sure you don't put spaces either side of it or anything.

Yeah.

It's not space, M-dash, space.

Now, look, I jest.

Jason, the capital B doesn't really bother me.

I just like consistency.

I would say I'm more of a grammar enthusiast than a Nazi because, look, language changes.

Things only develop and we only have...

A variety because mistakes or creative things are done, right?

And if people are consistent, then that's clear understanding.

I'm not going to...

Now, see, Jason, you've covered your fun changes again with your little avatar.

Oh, wow.

Okay, we've gone for capital U and capital C for Pascal case within upcycled.

We've got spaces around the M-dash.

And now we've got a lowercase B with an uppercase R.

So it's upcycled, dramatic pause, braided.

It's like an iPod.

You got to get the braided in there.

Yeah.

Wow.

This is great podcast material.

I have to say.

It is a really good cable, though.

Describing letter changes in a note.

It is a really good cable.

It's a 10 out of 10 cable.

You want apps?

We got apps.

It's Hemispheric Apps.

Something that does have a capital letter as a brand name.

Jason, you've been using Darkroom.

I am using it.

I paid for it.

And we all know, at least Andrew does.

Once you pay...

You pay for something, you use it no matter what.

Absolutely.

You can hate it, but you will keep using it.

All right.

If anybody's all about sunk cost, it's our friend Andrew.

Darkroom is an app for the Mac for...

Well, it's for everything.

It's Mac.

It's iPad.

It's iOS.

It's the whole little family.

I guess not Apple Watch, because that would be very weird and cumbersome, probably.

But Darkroom is...

I would consider it basically like a layer on top of photos.

So you still use photos as your sort of bucket of stuff.

But Darkroom uses that as its source to pull from to do your edits.

So it's a photo editing program, again, for all the platforms, that pulls from your photos

library, which is nice.

You don't have to...

Like with Lightroom, where you would have to sort of have this separate library that

you have to now manage between photos and Lightroom.

This all just pulls from your photos library.

This all just pulls from the same place.

So I really like that.

Like Photomator does as well, where it's just sort of a layer on top.

Not in the sense that it is a plugin.

That's a little bit different, where if you're in photos and then you go to plugins and kind

of pull and edit in that way, this is a standalone thing.

But I just really appreciate the way that they have set up the application from an editing

workflow.

I think it's a lot more photographer focused, I guess I would say, than maybe photos is.

Photos feels more about just managing the photos.

The photos themselves and maybe putting them into some folders and so forth and then kind

of walking away, where this is more of a, I want to go through some photos, mark things

as favorites of ones I want to come back to, to edit.

So you can do your curation.

You can come back from, say, a vacation, do your curation, do your edits, and then do

your exports.

And the biggest thing that I like about it is if you shoot any camera that has a raw

functionality and you do raw and JPEG, in photos, it'll pull both in.

And merge them together perfectly fine.

That's great.

But it always defaults to JPEG.

And every time you want to start with your raw, you have to right click the image, say

use raw as default, and then wait for it to do whatever it's doing.

And then it's just very slow and cumbersome to do.

Whereas this one, you can say in the settings, I want either JPEG or raw to be the default.

So I think that's great.

If that's something you've ever kind of come up against, look at dark room.

If you're into filters.

They have a lot of cool filters.

And they also have like a filter community where you can download other people's filters

into your dark room and use those as well.

Or create your own and shove them the other way and submit them kind of into a community

of filters.

So it's just really cool.

I think it's a really nicely built app.

The workflow is very good.

And I'm very much enjoying it.

And I use that now.

It has replaced photos in my dock.

So there you go.

Dark room.

Really cool app.

That's a big development.

That's like the biggest news of this show.

It could be.

But photos was moved off your dock.

It moved.

Yeah, it's gone.

Goodbye.

So it doesn't do the integration thing.

You know how photos can support the, you can, almost like a plugin architecture.

So you can still use photos, but then you send it to dark room.

Yeah, this is not like that.

This is not the plugin piece.

This is a separate app that effectively just uses photos library as like your backend.

Okay.

So it's like a new front end for photos, I guess I would say.

Maybe that's the simplest way to describe it.

So photos is off the defaults list then?

Been replaced?

Yes.

Yeah.

Wow.

Wow.

You heard it here first.

Well, I mean, it would make sense if you hear it first.

But you still have all the nice syncing.

Well, I guess, hold on.

I said, nice syncing.

You still have the quote unquote syncing of photos across your devices, which is.

I think it's nice.

I've, I've never had issues with that.

It's great when it's not, um, paused for system optimization.

Whatever the that is.

But don't you appreciate that?

Like you're at the bat with your phone and it's going to just chill out for a second.

No, I never want photos to not upload.

The second I take a photo, I want it uploaded immediately because when my phone falls in

the ocean, I want my photos more than I want my stupid system optimized.

It's infuriating.

My Mac is plugged in with a billion gigabytes of Ram and we're, we're optimizing our system.

It's it's crazy.

I'm making so no, I don't like it.

All right.

Well, pretty clear on that one.

People get bent out of shape about like things that don't matter.

Like the settings app.

This actually matters.

I'll say.

So there you go.

I'll keep that as a note for next time.

Do not do not mention that in future.

I'm done being mad at photos.

Okay.

I have one more quick update before we get to Andrew's last update yearly.

Check in for the show.

Um, we will have one.

I'm working on it and it will be, I guess, surprisingly at the end of the year, given,

it seems every other surface on the planet is doing urine wrap ups like the first week of

December.

Yeah.

I don't understand how you have a year in wrap up on December 5th, but

is it because people tune out of podcasts and other shows by their Christmas period.

So they're trying to make sure they.

Get it in before people maybe don't listen to watch things as much, but it's not the whole year.

It is a, it is a year.

If you do it since the last year from that also earlier period, but they don't, I think they just, I don't know.

Anyway, ours will be on December 31st as intended by the calendar of it being a yearly wrap up.

So the, the year would be wrapped at the end.

So that's what makes sense to me.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Okay.

I just want to, I mean, I know, I know we run a weird fiscal year, but you know, our fiscal

wrap up will be different.

Of course it will be, it will end in June.

Correct.

Uh, for EOFI, but you know.

Are we doing like an earnings call starting for that to people have a chance to tune in

and submit questions and.

Well, it's, it's, it's like any other publicly traded company where if you're one prime plus

member, which means you're, you know, a shareholder, then you get to tune into the, the call and

voice.

You have an AGM.

You know, vote.

Where were you, you know, we reelected as the three directors and the show goes on.

So far four years running, we've been reelected.

So we'll see what happens next year.

I know I've got Ramiz's vote.

That's what you're doing.

You're juicing the vote.

I see now.

Okay.

I was going to say on the topic of interesting business initialisms like AGM, Andrew, what

on earth is this one that you've put in the notes?

I didn't even put that in there.

That was Jason's.

But I can tell you what it is.

Why is there a basketball there?

I can tell you what it is.

I can't tell you our results, but I can tell you what the acronym stands for.

EBITDA.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.

Oh, I knew the first four letters, but I wasn't sure about the last two.

Yeah, the DAB is.

Righto.

Usually you just go with the EBIT.

The EBITDA is really like, I mean, they're non-cash elements that are being incorporated

there.

So.

Okay.

So it is an acronym.

You actually say it like a fake word.

You don't spell out the letters.

No.

EBITDA.

It's fun.

Say it, man.

I don't want to.

If we stop right now, that is all I wanted from this.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.
