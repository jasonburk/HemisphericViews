Now to jump in, I think we should introduce our special guest pretty early.
If you don't know who the guest is, if you don't know Gene, then you've been hanging
out in the complete wrong part of the internet.
It's usually two verse one in this realm, and I'm always outnumbered, but now I've brought
backup.
So now I've got not only someone in the same hemisphere, but the same time zone and the
same town.
So I'm like really pushing all the buttons here.
Jean MacDonald is here with us today and I could not be more proud to have her here.
She is truly like no other.
Jean, I think probably everyone knows you already, but if they don't, feel free to give
them the long, short or medium version of what you're all about.
The way I know you all is through micro.blog, which we have all been active on for quite
while and I have been working with Manton Rees, the founder, since the launch, more
or less the beginning, very beginning of the launch with, as the community manager, which
was a position that Manton committed to creating when he did the Kickstarter for micro.blog
if he hit a certain stretch goal. So when I told some friends that I got this job, my
friend James Dempsey said, "Oh, you're the stretch goal." I'm like, "Yes, that's me."
That's a nice way of putting it. I would like that on a t-shirt with like me
stretching or something. But yes, I've been around the Mac and Apple nerd for
quite a while since my first Macworld in 2004 when I volunteered or was
volunteered to work at the booth of my good friends at Smile Software and I had
such a good time at Macworld I thought I could see how it might be fun to work in
this you know industry and well here we are 16 years later it is still fun. I
I don't consider myself so much in the Mac and Apple industry anymore as the
Internet at large, but of course there are a lot of
Folks that I know from those Apple days and I'm still quite
You know laden with many Apple products. I
Think actually Jean I remember
Hearing about you probably at around that time actually with smile software
And that was probably a similar time that I was getting into the the Mac as well
the Mac world was the kind of place that I
Longed to go to at some point in my future and they had that you know
I only know this from internet reports and that sort of thing
but the whole idea of they had
tiny town where all the little miniature booths would go versus the the big the big expensive areas where
Big budget companies would put themselves
But it seemed like such a cool thing. But being in Australia, it's such a
distant far removed thing you think I'm just not gonna happen so the fact that 16 years on I'm now
Talking to you on a podcast. It's it's kind of crazy
Yeah, it's true it was
It was a fun
little group of those those
What I forget what they called them kiosks that you could rent
still for quite a lot of money considering the amount of space and
You couldn't do too much with your kiosk it just had like your name
printed above and you could put up some artwork and stuff but
after about I
Don't know four or five years of that
we decided to go in with some other developer friends and share a booth at a
10 by 20 space
So it's the big the big time the big time and that was like you made it to the big time
Oh my god, you had to I've never worked trade shows like, you know
like from that side of it before and basically all you get for your like gazillion dollars is
10 by 20 space of polished concrete and
Everything else is extra
Yeah carpets. Oh you want a power board?
Yeah, so you
Including like, you know
Electrical drops and internet drops and you have to figure out where you want those in your booth
like nothing is standard like that, you know, and
So the planning level went just to a quantum
leap higher and
It was very stressful because Mac world used to be in January and sometimes pretty early in January
So basically Christmas, New Year's was just off the calendar.
And we actually took a year off Macworld.
One year they moved from the big hall to the smaller hall at Moscone Center.
And that's not why we took the year off, but we were, I don't know, we started thinking
There's some developers like our friends at Rogamiba,
they just had it like as a plan every other year,
and we were thinking that's not a bad plan.
But on the other hand, I wouldn't discourage people
from spending money to meet your customers
and meet your fellow developers
or whatever business you're in.
It really did, I think, make a big difference
for the growth of Smile.
And so we had a lot of fun.
I have to imagine, because I've been to those Mac Worlds,
and I've been to those small Smile booths and the large,
that at some point, I'm sure we did cross paths much earlier
than when we actually met in person, which
is kind of fun to think about.
And also, I'm curious now with--
obviously, we're not going to any trade shows now.
And I think trade shows as a whole is drastically going to change in the future.
But something like micro.blog, I wonder how that would fit into that kind of world nowadays,
where if you're walking around the halls of XYZ conference, I don't know which one you'd
be at.
And would there be a micro.blog booth or not?
I just don't know how much that even makes sense anymore for a lot of companies being
online.
and having the reach that they have.
I think it would be cool, obviously, you'd pick up some people, but I just, I don't know
how much that's really needed in this kind of environment nowadays.
It's a really good question.
I mean, off the top of my head, I don't know.
Like I used to go to Blog World, which, you know, was a blog, Blog World and New Media
Expo to, to hang out with podcasters back when Smile, I mean, Smile is still a sponsor
of podcasts and that was where I, you know, wanted to be getting to know the podcasters
in our space and it was, we were such Mac nerds, you know, they're like, I don't know,
5,000 people there and then 10 or 12 of us just hung out together the whole time anyway,
it was like mini Mac world.
But blog, blogging in that sense, it was more about people making money from their blogs,
You know, and we're kind of not about that.
We're totally not about that.
We're about actually writing and engaging with the community.
If we, I mean, if budget were no object, I think we would enjoy and also get something
out of going to something like an event apart, you know, something where there's people who
blog a lot, you know, who might want something really simple and straightforward to host
their ideas on the internet.
Yeah, or like those smaller alt conference type situations where there's the giant mega
conference and then the little kind of specialized sub conferences off to the side.
Just on Jason's point, I'm interested, sorry to pick up on the idea of managing a community
or talking to people online rather than physically.
I know that since I joined micro.blog you've been a real presence there Jean and very very helpful
constantly
Guiding people in the right direction to know how to use the service and genuinely meet people you are you know engaging in community management
How difficult is that on an online basis with people you haven't met or is that something that you've just fallen into easily?
Well, you know I was on Twitter since 2007 and so I have some notion of how people
at least back then, you know, could find and engage with other like-minded people,
seeing people become friends even if they never meet or, you know, there was, of
course, people would have tweet-ups, you know, they'd be like, "Hey, I'm gonna be, you
know, in Austin, let's meet, like, at a bar with people you don't know, you know,
from Twitter personally," and then you become friends with them or you meet
them at a conference, you say, "Oh yeah, I've been following you," that kind of stuff.
I knew the potential, you know, of having something that would help people have one-to-one
connections even though it feels, certainly feels like a mass media now.
And I don't remember the last time I felt like I made a friend on Twitter.
I don't think it's too difficult.
I mean, we're, we are an online community, so it's got to work online.
I think that's one of the great things that I've enjoyed about micro, I say micro blog,
I can't get the micro dot blog.
I think because it is a smaller community, people are more willing to engage and be kind.
And look, you and Manton both set the tone with that as well.
But the fact that you can, I feel like I've made more genuine relationships as this podcast
attests to in the short period of time that I've been on microblog
Compared with all the years that I've been on the other social networks
Where you would really only follow the people you knew or there'd be some famous people
But it was always seemed superficial. I think microblog has gotten past that
Superficiality at least in my experience of it. I don't know if is that a common thing that you're noticing when you when you deal with people
people? I do think I notice people, you know, finding each other and, you know, carrying
on conversations and then following each other, you know, along. So I definitely see it, you
know, everybody's experience is going to be different. And some people are there just
to blog and they really aren't there to chit chat, or, you know, respond to other people.
that's totally okay, that's a blog, however you want to use it as your choice. And I think we
see this pretty frequently that people come on in little waves, mostly like leaving Twitter or
Facebook in disgust. And when they first get to micro.blog, they have this notion of how it should
work, you know, because they have an experience elsewhere. And,
you know, it takes a little while to get adjusted to a
different kind of, you know, mechanics of getting, you know,
following people, there's no liking of people's posts. And,
you know, even I find that frustrating sometimes, but then,
you know, because I want that person to know, yes, I like your
post. But so often, I just write that and say, hey, I like your
post or nice photo or even once in a great while just reply with an emoji. It's okay,
you can do that on micro.blog/timeline. And you know that you don't know who's following you
seems, if you're used to that, it seems like a limitation. But once you get used to the micro.blog
way of using it, you realize it's quite liberating. You don't have to stress about is somebody
going to unfollow me. I mean, they probably will, but you won't know. So it's better that
way.
It feels like the business model, at least from my perspective, has a lot to do with
that where when your business is built on people giving you cash, it's inherently more
of an active scenario where you're going to actively participate versus when you're building
your business upon ads. You almost prefer people to be passive because them interacting
could potentially be negative towards your advertising.
Whereas if they're just blindly looking at things
going through a feed and maybe they click it,
that's a better scenario for you to be in.
So I think the fact that you're putting that money forward,
and I think we've said that even in the past shows,
is that that $5 is kind of a goodwill to say,
like I'm here because I want to be here,
versus I just sort of stumbled in here
and yeah I guess I'll just hang out because I have nothing to lose.
I really relate or agree with what Gene said about the idea of using it differently from the way that you originally envisaged or intended.
Like you said Jason, when I signed up I thought okay I'm giving money I'm going to be actively involved in this thing
but I really personally focused on the word blog and I thought this is going to be where I'm going to write from now on
but I didn't foresee the conversational aspect, the actual ping-ponging backwards and forwards,
which leads to, as Andrew said, a conversational setup in a podcast like this.
And the other thing that I didn't realize, the second major use that I get out of it
personally, is it became kind of like the dream version of Instagram that I had back
in 2010 when it launched.
The fact that now you've got an app like Sunlit and this beautiful way of simply sharing photos
with people in this community and even sending a URL to family or friends out of this lockdown
network I had no idea how much I would use it personally just for sharing photos of pets
or special moments or something.
That is a good point too.
I once did a talk about, you know, why you want your own domain and one of the things
that I spent some time doing was getting screenshots of Facebook and Twitter when you're not logged
in. So like, it like the link you might send to a friend and then, you know, the, the screen just
fills up with like, sign up now or log in now and like, you could say no, but it just comes back
every page and I said, Is this what you want your content? You know, is this where you want your
content to live? Where your photos, your things that you want to share with family, especially
people who don't use those platforms and never will. So at least a micro.blog. Yeah, I mean,
if I could convince certain family members to use RSS, for example, that would be awesome. But
RSS seems to be like some kind of magical concept to people who, you know, it's hard to get across
like what why it could be really helpful and it probably it probably matters how many blogs
you want to follow if you only want to follow one blog like your kids blog or your you know
your friends blog you I do have friends told me oh I saw whatever picture and I said oh
and they said yeah I just go visit your website every couple days I'm like okay and that and
that's lovely too they get to see the full expression of your website I'm guilty of reading
RSSs and sometimes not bothering to go through the website.
You read the feed and you never actually see the presentation.
So every website suddenly looks exactly the same.
So there is something to be said for visiting a website.
So we've all been on the service for over a year now, I believe.
Well, Gene excluded, obviously, but we've all been there for over a year now and we
just crossed the launch of Microblog 2.0, as it's been named.
I think that was on the 30th of September.
Um, so obviously a lot has changed in just a short time, a year.
Um, I'm, I'm curious, obviously there's, you know, there's a roadmap, there's
things to come, um, what now?
Cause I feel like 2.0 is kind of that situation where your 2.0 is what you
always envisioned your 1.0 was going to be.
And that's just the nature of building things.
So now that we're kind of at that stage where things feel very, at least from a user perspective,
they're very mature, things feel solid now, everything, you know, it's quick, it's snappy,
all the features seem to be there. Is it more about community building now? Or is it still
a pretty solid balance of, and I don't want to like, put Matt in a box here and say he's not,
innovating or anything.
It's just, what do you kind of see as being priority one now, if you had to pick?
Is it really more people-focused now that the technology is kind of pretty solid and
the technology will kind of go on and on in the background?
>>KAJA: Well, you know, Manton is always going to want to improve the platform.
I mean, he has still plenty of things he would like to improve or maybe add at some point.
And he's constantly surprising me.
I refrain sometimes when he posts,
like, oh, I added the following things.
Sometimes I don't even know when they're coming out,
because he works on them.
And then I want to say, yes, people,
you might be forgiven if you wonder if Manton ever sleeps,
because it's really quite an extensive platform now.
And certainly John Hayes has put in a lot of work on Sunlit,
the photo blogging app, but it's mostly Manton.
And it's certainly none of it is me,
because that's not my area of expertise
other than to report bugs or request features.
And so I do think that having a blogging app
Having this 2.0 out does sort of free us up to renew our efforts or find new places where
we want to make sure people are aware that micro.blog is an option.
In particular, now when you go to the web, it's really clear, I think, that it's a blogging
platform, not just a social media opportunity.
And ultimately that's the thing that people are paying for.
It's a very reasonably priced way to have a blog that also is fairly straightforward
and easy to use.
Right.
Which I think is great too, because then you have less of people coming thinking it's Twitter
clone, and it's actually something different.
Because at some point I feel like that, I think early on, even I'm guilty of this too,
it was the easiest way to describe it.
It was, "Oh, what is that?"
It's a...
And you start going through all these things and they're like, "What are you saying?"
And you say, "Well, okay, you know Twitter?"
And then minus the garbage, it's that.
And then they go, "Oh, okay, great.
That makes sense."
But now I've...
At least I try to kind of shy away from that aspect of it.
Because as soon as you say it's like Twitter, you lose a certain percentage of people because
they're already on Twitter, so they don't care and they tune out.
You lose the rest of the people because they're like, "I'm already on Twitter.
I don't want more of that."
So I think being able to have a way to describe it now that is, you know, that can come up
maybe later in the conversation.
So I think it's much more clear now up front.
And also having different, for me, one thing about the platform is I love the different
community kind of challenge aspect to it, where it's very, you can be in it if you want
to, or you can passively observe it or something in between.
So we've had many photo challenges in the past, and I think we've got another one coming
up soon.
And that is just yet another way that it lends itself to be just something that's different.
And there's no pressure to be involved, but it's very accessible if you want to be involved.
If you had another platform, pick one of them, and there was a big photo challenge thing,
you would probably just scroll right past it and not even think that that was for you.
Because I think when you're going through other platforms, nothing on there really feels
like it's for you.
Whereas this comes across as somebody that is, you know, if it's Gene as a community
manager and you see it in the discover section, you go, "Oh, I'm here.
I'm part of this.
I can do that too."
So I think the different community events, I'll call them, has been a fun part of the
platform that I don't really think you get anywhere else.
You know, if you go to wordpress.com, there's not going to be a community photo challenge.
It's just not what it's for.
So again, I think just building on that community aspect.
Yeah, yeah, I'm really looking forward to that photo challenge.
I think it's only less than a week away when you publish this podcast, October 13th and
14th.
I'm calling it a global photo challenge because we wanted to do instead of the challenges
we've done before, which have been really incredible. Like I've been very impressed
with people's output and some people do like their month long challenges. And those are
a lot of photos to take. I didn't I didn't I kind of washed out myself personally on
the one that we did in August. I got partially just because of staying at home pretty much
hardly going like, you know, less than a half a mile outside of my house. Maybe once a week.
I wasn't creative enough to keep coming up with new pictures.
I got through that month and it was hard work.
It was really hard work.
I was drained by the end of it.
And I've totally bailed out on Inktober this year.
It was like, no, I can't do more drawing.
That was hard enough last year.
I think drawing just isn't my thing.
Although the cool thing about this upcoming photo challenge is it's for 24 hours only
and it's one photo only.
So I'm going to be reminding people of this as I follow up on the plans for next week
is that I don't want you to post four or five photos.
I don't want to curate your photo collection.
I want you to tell me which is the photo, you know, everybody pick one.
Not that you can't post the other ones.
But for that day, one person, one photo within a 24 hour period.
And I got inspired by the idea of that series of books called A Day in the Life of, which
actually started in Australia, or the first one was done in Australia.
One of the main organizers of it, a guy named Rick Smolin, he is a National Geographic photographer,
he was and he was assigned to do something in Australia.
And I think that's when he came up with the idea of hiring, I mean, they got professional
photographers, 100 photographers for one day all over Australia.
And that was so popular that I don't know how many sequels they made, but I know
that they have made day in the life of Hawaii.
I used to have day in the life of the Soviet union.
I may still have that in my basement.
I should remember that's a historical art artifact.
A lot of track to photos.
Have you guys seen, have you guys had heard of that previously before?
I had not heard of this the day in the life thing.
Yeah, I remember being a kid and we had a copy of that book.
It was a big coffee table book, hardcover, beautiful book.
And being a kid, you know, and flipping through that, you know, it's just fun to look at and
feel like this is my country being represented.
It was a big thing for our nation as well, which is much smaller and there wasn't the
internet back then.
So you felt very, it was an isolated country.
And this was kind of putting Australia on the globe.
And even as a kid, I could sort of get a sense of that.
And even now, I still remember flipping through it and there were photos of people in a place
in South Australia called Cooper Pedy.
Oh, I know.
And they lived, yeah, and they lived basically underground in caves because of the climatic
conditions and the, it's opal mining I think they do there.
I think that's right.
And they'll basically live in the caves that were from opal mines, I think is my memory
of it.
And yeah, it was just these amazing photos of people in their homes underground.
And as a kid in Perth, Western Australia, thinking that just a few thousand kilometers
away other Australians were living like that.
It was pretty cool.
It was an amazing book.
Maybe we will get a book out of this, potentially.
Yeah, I mean, my mind jumped right to that result when I after I thought like, I mean,
it sort of evolved, I thought, well, I don't want to do it if we don't get at least 100
people to do it, like, because I don't want it to feel like, oh, do it or don't do it.
I want people to feel like I'm contributing to a project.
So the photo challenge coming up the worldwide photo challenge, I guess we're calling it
is October 13th. It's going to be one photo in a 24 hour period. And how I
guess my only question is, how do people, how do you mark if I upload 10
photos during that time? What do I say? This is my pick. Is there something
special that I need to do?
Yeah, I think, you know, dare I say it, there be a hashtag,
some kind of unique identifier.
So when people upload them, I want them to say where the photos taken. I mean,
it doesn't have to be the exact GPS coordinates, but just like, you know, Perth, Australia,
you know, or Wollongong, Wollongong? Correct. Very good. Yeah, so we'll have to, we'll have
to think of something specific. And so I don't, I can't say that right now, but I will have
it figured out. I'll be also curating things into a special Discover feed on that during
that 24 hours. And it's really October 13th to the 14th because nobody has the same time
zone. We have 14 different time zones.
Oh, we know all too well about time zones and how great they are.
We've discovered this is why nobody else does an Australian-US podcast combo, because the
time zones just don't work. Somebody's going to be upset.
We're maintaining the international relationship just by doing this really.
So we were talking about photos, you're talking about the Soviet Union and that kind of in
a roundabout way brings actually back to I think it was last episode where we were talking
about I was looking at an old thing in my house.
What is the oldest thing?
So that was kind of a challenge I threw out speaking of challenges.
So I'm curious what everyone has and I don't know if you want me to start.
Go for it.
oldest thing that I found, which I feel like I must have something older, but it looks
like the date is 1926. Wow. Pretty old, pretty decent in terms of age. It is a Kodak Hawkeye
number two model C box camera. Wow. It's almost like LG TV naming. Yeah, I know. That's kind
of what I was thinking actually. Cause yeah, everything now is a terrible, horrible name.
You get like Sony headphones and it's WH1000X Mark II.
Yeah, that's apparently we were doing that back in 1926 as well.
Says he who has the Shure SM7B microphone.
Very true.
Not the SM7A or the SM7, the SM7B, which now I think this thing has been out for 30 years.
So that means there'll be a C model probably next week now.
So you're all welcome for that.
But it's a, it's a one 20 format camera.
Uh, it's like, I don't know, I'd say it's roughly, we'll go eight
centimeters by 11 centimeters by 15 centimeters.
Thank you for the metrics.
You're you're welcome.
You're welcome.
And it's just the craziest thing.
It's literally a cardboard box with fake leather on it.
It's, I wouldn't even call it fake leather.
It's it's like cardboard leather.
You put one 20 film in it and you get to turn it to the next.
Speaking of photos, like imagine having to do a, uh, your one photo on this and
then figure out how to get out of there.
I actually put one 20 film in this about a year ago, and I believe
I'm halfway through the role.
I don't know.
There's no way to tell.
There's no window telling you what photo you're on.
You have to actually just write it down.
I lost the note.
So I'm not really sure.
I think I'm about halfway, but it's going to be really
interesting to develop this.
It's almost like my own little mini time capsule.
And it's literally just a shutter button.
There's no focus.
There's no viewfinder.
There's nothing.
It's just push the little thing down and it takes a photo and
you hope that you got something.
So 1926 is my oldest thing that I have found so far.
So do you think you could take a photo of this podcast right here and now, and
that would be something that you could later upload to the web as a memento of
this time?
I could try.
It might be too dark.
It needs more light.
Worth a shot.
Oh, right.
It'll end up as some impressionist masterpiece as a result.
It's worth a shot.
Okay.
Why don't we move into the shower?
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
I've got a sunburned face.
Here we go.
Three, two, one.
That was it.
Click.
It made a noise.
That was it.
That was a very interesting sound.
I think it worked.
Now do you have to wind the film on?
I do.
Yeah.
I don't, but I'm going to do, well, should I do that now?
He's going to turn his, his entire room red for us.
That one could have been a double exposure actually.
So it may not have actually wound up to the next one.
So yeah, that was the thing with this.
Yeah.
Cameras as you, you had to have a workflow that would prevent that.
And I think that part of it would be always winding the film after a
photo versus doing it before, but one or the other, you have to, you have
to be very diligent. Yep. So that may be actually a picture of a podcast overlaid over a cat,
which actually is pretty appropriate. It's very internet. Yeah. I think my object is
from around the same time as yours, Jason, but it's quite a bit different to give you
some context. It's, I suppose you could call it a family heirloom. So it was given to me
by my now deceased grandfather whose name was John. He grew up in the rural
New South Wales town of Cowra and his father was called Martin so we shared
the same name and he was a teacher but given the fact that it was a rural town
he also had this very unusual item which has now as I explained has been passed
down to me I'm just gonna reach for it now. What you are looking at is a
a branding iron with my initials.
Oh, that is cool.
Wow.
Wow.
So, yes, it's quite terrifying.
Yeah, I was going to say, cool.
If anyone does break into the house.
And also, please don't ever use that money.
Look, I justify keeping it nearby as a weapon if someone decides to break into the house.
But if someone does displease me and there is a fireplace nearby, who knows what's going
to happen.
I feel very inadequate with my label maker now. That's just, that pales in comparison.
I've never tested it, but you never know.
I'm just waiting to see Martin's MacBook with a giant MS burned into the back of it.
Try stealing that.
And next week we'll be bringing a cow in to the podcast.
That is so cool.
You heard Jason's camera click, you'll hear a sizzle next week.
Wow, that's super cool. How long have you had that?
Oh, he gave it to me, it must have been about a decade ago or something. So yeah, I was a bit
younger, but he personally didn't have much of a use for it when he was alive. It was more of a
decorative piece because of all the times I visited him, I never saw any cattle, even cow
or any more. So yeah, here it is. I think I actually need to dip it in some Coca-Cola or
something to sort of give it a new lease on life because it does have that little bit of a
rusty finish to it. I'm not sure if you can see it.
It's so cool. It's so handmade looking - I love it. I think for the listeners who are we will take photos of these and put
Them in the show. Yes, I'll be in there for sure. Yeah
Yeah, this is not something you leave around children, so thank you
So that goes over to me I guess now I had a little look around I do have
In and I asked my wife what do we have that's old and we sort of thought about it and I do have an indigenous
Artwork that's on my wall currently covered by a towel for audio acoustic
Reasons, but I decided professional audio treatment, correct? Correct? Yes, but unfortunately
I'm not going to do that one because I don't actually know the date whereas this one I do know at least
How old it is and it's a book that I have with published is from my mother
published in
1951 and the book is called a race for bill and it's that lovely old sort of
publication that sort of has the
nice binding and you smell it and
It has that lovely musty old book smell and I remember this race for bill. It's about a kid who goes Billy cart racing
In him in somewhere in America because it's an American book. My mother
Was essentially American my dad definitely was yes, so and I can tell you here it has on the imprint
What while the all-american soapbox derby is a national institution and this story?
Conforms to the 1950 rules all the people in incidents in the book are fictitious
So you had this interesting balance between you know, the billy cart racing that was done properly
But this story of a boy what woven through it and I just love it
But capitalist America is was was and he is strong because chapter 5
Bill gets a sponsor
Can we there you go who's the sponsor is it's some cigarette company surely
Let me have a flute. It's been a long time since I read this probably about 20 years since I read it
It's like kids soapbox racing brought to you by Fatima cigarettes
Totally normal. Yeah, I'm flipping through a don't see quickly.
Australia, perhaps fosters, you know, get fosters onto the kids while they're young.
I shall have to take that under advisement. The one thing about this book though, I know that I made my mother very angry because it was her book, which I sort of somewhat inherited.
But as a child, I decided that it would be a fun idea to put a peanut sticker on the cover.
cover. I was gonna ask about that. It didn't seem like it really fit the the
book but yeah yeah and then you can see there's there's a slightly peeled off
area of the sticker where I think I realized I've made a big mistake here I
need to get the sticker back off again and I failed but it adds a nice little
good color green cover a race for Bill with a bit of lioness and his blanket
I'm stuck on the front. I love it. Speaking of sponsors thing. I'm kidding. We don't have a sponsor
Yeah, Billy had sponsors on the way down
We're brought to you by no, we're not brought to you by a cigarette company
Gene do you by chance randomly have something with you that is old from your house?
Not to put you on the spot. I do have
No, no, you did you I listened to the last podcast. I knew this. Oh
That must be that one download
There it is. Found it.
And then, you know, when I was coming on, I'm like, well, I do have this very old thing.
And I don't have the exact date, but this I'm holding it up. But this is a music box.
Oh, oh, wow. It was my grandmother's, who was German. And so it says Elfenbein Zigaretten
Dose. Speaking of cigarettes, it's a cigarette.
Wow.
So I know.
And it has this little English hunting party
like miniature on the front.
And it's all carved ivory box.
It's definitely yellowed over the year.
But it's a music box.
And I used to play with this like crazy
when I was a little kid.
And so do you want to hear the music?
Yes, please.
Oh, absolutely.
Please.
Yes.
Here we go.
See if you recognize it.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
I'm putting it into Shazam.
I was gonna ask if that's what you were doing, I saw you reaching for it.
So are we gonna get a copyright strike now?
Is that how this works?
Some of maybe your older audience listeners will know this. I didn't know what the tune
was when I was a kid. But one day when I was in college, I was sitting in the movie theater
for classic film, you know, series, and it was The Third Man, which is a famous Orson
Welles movie from, I guess, the 40s, like right after World War Two, set in Vienna.
all spy. I think it's a Graham Greene story, The Third Man. And it opens with somebody
playing the zither. And that is the tune. And I heard the tune. I'm like, Oh my god,
it's the music box tune. And, and that music was written for the third man. So that my
way of dating this box is this music box cigarette box because it does if you open it up, there's
like a little space to store your cigarettes.
It has a typewritten label on the back, and it's apparently number 50 out of 59.
So 59 of them were made.
I thought it would be older.
I knew it was older than me.
I figured my grandmother bought it in Germany when she went back in the '50s for a visit.
The movie came out in the late '40s, and the music was written for the movie.
So I think it can't be older than 1940 something,
unless that was already a tune, like a folk tune.
I don't know.
Unfortunately, like a few years ago,
the public television show, Antiques Roadshow,
came to Portland.
And when I saw they were coming, I'm like,
I'm totally applying.
I'm going to totally bring the music box.
I'm finally going to find out something more about this box.
And I didn't get picked.
They just didn't, you know, it was like, I guess, a lottery.
And I just, you ever have that feeling where you're like, oh, this is how it's going to
happen and I'm, you know, I'm meant to do this finally.
And I didn't get to go.
Dang.
I'm just amazed that it still works so well.
Yeah.
Well, there are very little mechanics to it.
You know, there's a spring, you wind it up, and then I have seen the insides of these
boxes, although not this one, I don't think.
You know, it has just like a little cylinder.
It has little pricks and then there's like keys that the pricks play.
And it says it has 28 notes on it.
Or the tune is 28 notes.
I don't think the thing has 28 different notes.
And being from the 40s and 50s, they found a way to put cigarettes in everything.
That's what I was just trying to reconcile.
The fact that, to me, a music box is something for little kids.
You give it to your little girl or something, she puts it on a dressing table.
But you also put the pack of windfields inside it or whatever.
It's portable entertainment for your smoke-out break, that's what it is.
I mean, if you think about it, maybe it was like a...
It never had cigarettes in it, ever, since I've seen it.
Even though my grandmother did smoke, I don't think she kept cigarettes in there.
But every time you would go for a cigarette, the third man would play.
And you think of Orson Welles, like, you know, his dissolute, you know, spy self out there
in Vienna, like, causing, you know, problems.
I don't think I've ever seen the movie The Third Man.
I don't, I maybe I have, but I don't recall.
But it's, I'm definitely going to search for it now in, uh, one of the 57 different video
services that I pay for every month, whether I know it or not.
Um, and I would say that everybody should look, but it seems like that's one of the
issues we have with all these stupid services is that whatever I have doesn't necessarily
mean that you have it or that you'll have it next week, which is why I have every single
one because it's becomes a matter of, is it on Netflix?
No.
on Hulu? No. Disney plus? No. Uh, what else is there? Prime video? No. Apple TV plus?
No. It's there's 57 different services now. And I'm, I, I have every single one I think
at this point. And I, I couldn't tell you why, but I'm curious how that, how that differs
for you guys in Australia too, because I know obviously the content's going to be different,
but do we even have the same services at this point or are we still trying to play catch
up on who has what?
Well, I just want to say firstly that was meant to be the whole point of the Apple TV universal search which has been
Destroyed bit by bit, you know that it was you meant to talk into the Siri remote and it would just find you the program
Irrespective of service. Do we blame Netflix for that? That was like the first domino, wasn't it?
And then they all just followed after that
In Australia, we have much the same in terms of the big
International brands so we have Netflix
Disney Plus Apple TV
What else we got Martin?
Well the other big presence here is actually Stan, which wouldn't exist in the US and that's
owned I think by the Nine Network?
Yeah.
Is that right?
I think they bought it.
But otherwise, yeah, we miss out on things like Hulu and now the new Peacock service
I think.
So we really just have the major ones.
I read the other day that we're soon to get, what is it going to be, Viacom Plus or Paramount
Plus?
Paramount Plus, who owns one of our commercial TV channels over here.
So we're rebranding it.
It's called 10 All Access at the moment, which is an Australian sort of thing.
They're rebranding that to take on, I guess, the international product next year.
That's what we call CBS All Access.
I was going to ask you, where do you get your Star Trek?
In Australia, because that's where all the Star Trek is now on CBS, soon to be Paramount,
whatever.
We get the Star Trek on Netflix, actually.
That's where it turns up here.
It's in a different service.
It's the one thing we get, that's it.
You can have Star Trek in the common area, and nothing else.
Do you guys have, I mean, what do you generally...
I'm guessing you probably have Prime Video as well, which is...
I don't know, Prime Video always seems like the one that every once in a while you'll
hear about it, but it seems like the least discussed service, and I don't know if that's
just because most people don't even know they have it if they have Prime already, or it's
just the lack of content, I'm not sure.
The interface offended me so much when I tried it that I had to leave.
I couldn't explain the disgust that I felt in navigating it and some of the content was good there
That's why I wanted to try it, but I just had to leave
In fact, that's why I forgot about it didn't even think to mention it
It has the boys though, which is a great show great show with watching
Many times as I need to close my eyes or sometimes cover my ears
it is a great show, but
it's funny you say that about the interface because I watch most things on my iPad and I
I started regularly just using Amazon Prime versus Apple because I didn't like the Apple interface.
Oh, it's not good either for different reasons.
Yes, at least like it's much easier to navigate through something in Prime than Apple.
That whole idea of like, you know, move your finger up and down for half speed, this speed,
scrubbing through the timeline.
I find that very annoying.
I just want to go to a spot on the timeline or I want to go backwards by 10 seconds. Would you mind?
What about when Hulu puts the underline on the wrong side when they put the underline on top?
Have you noticed that on the Hulu interface?
The lot so normally you'd go and select something the line would be under what you want. Oh, they put the line on top
So, I don't maybe that's just me
I look at the whole screen when you touch it. It's terrible
It's almost like when you go to an opera and the subtitles are surtiles at the top and you just go exactly. Yes. Yeah
Yeah, precisely. Yeah, so we all I know every single person on this podcast has bought some Apple thingy in the last year
Surely, so we all have Apple TV Plus for the free year, which is coming up. I think in
November is coming up
November, which is coincidentally lined up with the Apple one service.
I'm sure.
So that once that year runs out, you'll one way or another, you're
probably going to keep it, whether we get another year for free for buying
another thing, or it just comes bundled as part of Apple one service.
I don't know.
I was a little underwhelmed at first when I first saw it happen.
I thought, you know, of course a bundle makes sense.
I didn't think it made sense for us personally, but then I
actually added everything up.
It was actually a really good deal.
You know, generally you don't hear people saying that an Apple thing is a quote,
good deal, but after I added it up, it made sense.
I don't, is that the same for you all as well?
Yes, definitely.
When I first heard there was going to be a bundle, I thought, no, thank you, Apple.
I don't want all your services, but when you add the storage, um, the iCloud,
you know, storage, and if you want to try fitness plus you're practically
there to having everything else.
and the Apple music too for us.
That was the one I forgot about.
I forgot about Apple music that we are, we have the family account for that.
And that was the one that pushed it over.
So now I think if we do the bundle, we it's five or $10 cheaper than what we're
paying now, and we get the other stuff that, you know, arguably we weren't using,
but it's one of those, if, if it's there, maybe I'll use it every once in a while,
or maybe I'll never use it.
And I just saved five bucks either way.
It's kind of a win.
Not to mention if you're in this nerdy bracket, you're pretty much pulled over the line by
the storage, as Jane said, because I looked at it thinking, "Oh, there'll be options."
No, there are no options.
I can only get this one because that is my current storage tier.
So it looks like I'm going to have to become a gamer and a serious news enthusiast to enjoy
that package.
Yeah, that's like the last thing I want right now is more news.
Will you guys get the...
I'm blanking on what the...
There was different tiers.
was like beginner, medium and super ultra, whatever it was.
Do you have, are you going to get the top one premier?
I think it was called maybe.
Yeah, I will pretty much because of the storage.
Yeah.
I, I mean, I already, I was looking at it as we're doing the same sort of mental
mathematics.
So I'm already paying for two terabytes of storage.
I'm paying for Apple music family plan.
I'm paying, well, I've got a free Apple TV.
I wouldn't buy it again if I, if I had the option.
Um, and then I've got, what's the other thing I'm paying for?
The other Apple service?
Um, music, Apple arcade.
No, it's a music.
I, cloud arcade.
Maybe it's just the storage.
Fitness.
Well, you would get fitness.
I thought there was another one.
No, wait.
You said you wouldn't pay for the Apple TV again.
Did you mean the Apple TV hardware or Apple TV plus the service?
Apple, Apple TV plus the service.
I've enjoyed, I've really enjoyed the shows that it has.
So I probably have watched more of Apple TV plus shows than any other, to be
perfectly honest, but for some reason I still don't think it's worthwhile.
Although as soon as Ted Lasso came on again, I would be subscribing because that is one of the greatest shows of all time
But no this way with the the premier service. It just makes sense to do to do that
Yeah, it's just it adds up and it's like why not? It's it's fine
I think it's interesting that they kind of I think they really had to do that
I think if Apple TV was left to fend for itself, I think it would fall by the wayside
So this is a great way if you're a multi-billion dollar company
you can cross subsidize and make something that would otherwise fail be a success.
I find it really interesting too how we perceive the different services. We have Netflix that has
seemingly unlimited number of things on it.
So it has a billion different shows. Great. And yet we don't, you know, we watch
one or two shows on there. I would not be surprised if months go by where I don't even open Netflix
just because there's other stuff to watch. But there's this perception on the Apple TV side where on
On Apple TV plus there's.
I don't know.
I don't know how many of them either 10 shows, but maybe the, the, the
hit rate on them is, is, is higher, but yet it still seems like this.
Not not worth it kind of scenario where paying $15 for 10 shows that I really
like for some reason, doesn't mesh well with our brains compared to Netflix.
That has unlimited numbers of things that we never will watch, but yet we
feel like we're getting something, you know, like, Oh, for that 10 bucks, I've
got all these shows, but I never watch them.
So I don't know how much of this is actual content versus mental.
Netflix is trying to guilt you into falling for the illusion
that if you leave, you lose an entire world of content.
Whereas something like Disney is remember all that nostalgic stuff
that we locked away for years that you could never see.
Now you can pay and unlock it all.
So I feel like Disney plus and Netflix are almost the same thing
of pay for everything.
It's just one service.
You actually like what's on there or you know what it is because it has a legacy.
Netflix just feels like throw it at the wall
and something will stick.
Yeah, totally.
That's interesting.
So we basically all have all the services covered,
it sounds like.
I don't think there's anything that anyone doesn't have.
Maybe Peacock?
Or does somebody have Peacock?
I haven't done Peacock yet, but they
don't have Friends on it yet.
I would probably subscribe just to be
able to watch some old episodes of Friends.
And there was something else on NBC.
Oh, Law and Order.
Law and Order is actually a tricky thing to get streaming, like the entire run of the
original series is like 20 seasons and that's an NBC show and so I looked into it and I
said, "Oh, they don't have Law and Order," which is probably good because once Law and
Order is on and I can just binge it, I often do nothing else.
Does the passion for that show extend to the variants?
Yes.
Of Law & Order?
Right.
So do you rank S for your Criminal Intent high?
I'm very curious about this now.
I rank the original the highest just because it is the original and it's got a lot of,
I mean it's got some of the best actors in it originally.
Criminal Intent was my favorite because I love Vincent D'Onofrio so much and that's
really good. But I recently did have access to binge watch some Law & Order marathons,
and I thought, I don't re-watch those as often anymore, because they don't have the whole
the true Law & Order like dichotomy of here's the investigation, here's the trial on criminal
intent. They rarely have trials. And SVU, I avoid it forever because I was, it's very,
very disturbing content even more so than the other shows.
But I recently became,
I was watching one of the latest ones
and I decided I just love Mariska Hargitay so much.
And I do love that show,
but really only like the last 10 seasons,
not the originals.
So probably more law and order than you need to know,
but I've spent a lot of time watching it.
- I feel like anytime I have a conversation
with somebody about streaming media, it always seems to more focus on back
catalog versus what's coming or what's available now that is new content.
It's almost like the new flashy content is, is an afterthought versus what do
they have, you know, from the nineties, what do they have from the two thousands?
And it's like the back catalog still is, is kind of the, the thing that people
are looking for in these services.
And then, oh yeah, by the way, they have Ted Lasso and this and that,
and the Mandalorian and all those other ones.
At some point, I would imagine that will switch over.
And I don't know if that's just maybe internet generational kinds of things
where we've just, that's what we still want.
Or if we're in a weird, you know, we have that 2020 multiplier right now,
where we just want the past.
Maybe.
Look, I think you're totally right.
I was just going to say with, I unsubscribed recently from Disney plus
purely because all that I watched on it was The Simpsons.
And I thought this was my habit for 15 years as a kid
to watch The Simpsons at six o'clock after school,
just before dinner time.
And now I'm paying for it for, I don't know what,
I don't know why.
- Yeah, and that's the headline usually,
is like new XYZ service coming,
and they have this show from 25 years ago.
And everybody's like, oh, I'll pay $10 a month
to probably not actually watch it,
but at least I have it.
- Yeah. - Yeah.
I mean, I think that's one of the reasons that Apple TV Plus is, you know, sort of a
weird animal because it doesn't have a back catalog at all.
And for, you know, I've had it also for free the last year and I've only watched the morning
show.
I would watch these other shows.
I just, I don't know.
But it's like committing to a whole new show, you know, that I have to like learn all these
new characters and care about them.
And I don't know.
I still haven't watched Ted Lasso, but I will.
Watch Tiny World as well.
Oh, that's good.
Tiny World.
Yeah, it's like a nature documentary kind of thing with just the cinematography they
have in the show.
It doesn't feel like it's possible with the technology we have, but somehow they did it.
It's six episodes.
It's really short.
I would say definitely watch it.
Well, just an Australian fun fact for you.
So just to return to the Morning Show reference, in Australia, they couldn't call it the Morning
Show.
I'm not sure if you're aware of that.
the title to Morning Wars because we actually have, it's filmed on the East Coast of Australia,
a show called The Morning Show and it's dreadful.
And you can get up in the morning and it's after the earlier morning show, whatever that's
called, I can't remember.
That could be Sunrise or Today, I think, yeah.
Yeah, something like that.
So you can, you know, you can give them however many, you know, installments of payments to
get a fat blast or something or other and they will give it to you.
It's a real deal.
Yeah.
I was I was very impressed by that show, but when I first put it on I was like I'm gonna try something on the
Apple TV and of course, it's got Jennifer Aniston who I like and I thought I and Steve Carell who I like I thought oh
You know, let's check this out. I thought it was gonna be a comedy. I just hadn't read anything about it
It is not a comedy is very nice very heavy
I think a lot of people went into it thinking that which was definitely not helpful for the show because if you go into that
show with the wrong mindset you're just you're not gonna land I I mean that the
performances pulled me in and I couldn't stop watching it and it was really on
the nose in so many ways that though were uncomfortable I thought were very
well done do you guys purchased anything at all anymore absolutely I do I went for
those Friday iTunes discounts okay yeah but only digital right you're not
Are you buying physical media still?
Or do you have Blu-rays and all that?
I did.
No, no, no.
OK.
No, I-- oh, you did?
I did.
Criterion Collection added my favorite movie of all time,
which is Until the End of the World.
The director's cut, which is like five hours long instead
of three hours, released.
And I thought, I want that.
I mean, there's rarely a movie where I go like, no,
This movie to me is like one of my most important viewings.
It's super good.
If you haven't seen it, Australia people,
you should see it.
It's half filmed in Australia, including Cooper Pedy,
which is why I know where it is.
It's a fascinating, fascinating film.
And I wanted to get the director's cut,
which I had never seen.
And I'd seen it so many times.
I already owned it on Apple, but I hadn't seen, you know,
it's a rare director's cut where I can go,
this is new, that's new, this is new, you know?
and then see like the whole like why the director in this case I think was
absolutely right and a lot got cut out so and I also bought my second favorite
all-time film which was Room with a View because I wanted the extras and I wanted
to be able to watch that. I have a confession to make and I'd like to make
it here amongst my friends. I've never owned a blu-ray player.
Neither have I. I went from DVD, my DVD and it was sort of like
getting old and that was then it was sort of the battles between do you get
an HD DVD or Blu-ray. It was a bit like the VHS beta days. And so I just thought, I'll
just hang on to my DVD player and see how this plays out. DVD eventually died just the
time that... it wasn't really streaming, but it was accessibility for media online.
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me. I'll leave it at that.
That's a good way to say it. Thank you.
it became a thing. And so switch to that for a while. And now we've got streaming services
and I know that Blu-ray can still give a better quality, but I don't care that much. I think
Apple TV plus shows in particular are really high quality already and they're fine to watch.
I don't feel like I'm losing anything. And so Blu-ray was never alive to me and now it's
dead to me. Not to mention the cutting edge Blu-ray player
that's on its way out is the size of a television cabinet as the PS5 so yeah
maybe not the best investment if you're not into it already. I just found I think
three or four blu-rays when I was unpacking a box the other day and I
was surprised we even had them and immediately ripped them all put them on
storage and those are going out the door because I just don't want anything to do
with them. Yeah as well I'm just reflecting on the comment I made earlier
about Apple TV+ and saying I wouldn't resubscribe. I actually think I'm an idiot for saying that
because as I think back, I've watched all the shows, I've enjoyed most of them, I've
watched the full seasons which I don't do. I'm not a massive TV guy but I have watched
Sea and I watched Morning Wars and I watched Defending Jacob and Ted Lasso. It's hit rate
for me is off the charts compared to anything else.
So shame on me, shame on me because Apple TV plus is actually a winner and
I've got the wrong perception.
I think we've kind of conditioned ourselves in this weird way that, like I
said, every show on that you maybe watched every single one of them, but for some
reason, because it doesn't have, again, you know, 37 seasons of friends on it.
It's it's we're perceiving it as, as less valuable.
And I think that's just because we streaming services historically
have only ever had old stuff.
So that kind of became, I think that's where we started in the timeline of
streaming, whereas now if you were to start in that timeline, you might maybe
more think of stuff as being new, but I don't, yeah, I think it's strange.
I think we immediately dismiss apple TV plus because, um, because it
only has original new stuff and maybe none of those shows are for you.
And that's totally cool too.
But I think there's this weird perception that if, if, if it doesn't have an
infinite back catalog, it's not quote worth it.
Yeah.
So I'm sorry, Tim cook.
Oh, I spoke, I spoke poorly of your service.
He was definitely checking his bank account when you were saying that he was worried.
Yeah.
We've just lost the Australian market or at least the West Australian market.
Perth is out.
No, but I'll do my three months of Apple fitness.
And how would you track that?
With with this new Apple watch that I just got
I'm probably gonna have to save that for next week because we're running along
But yeah, i've upgraded from my series one to my series six and oh, baby. It's a big upgrade
You've got your full review ready for next time
Yes, tune in in a fortnight's time to find out what does andrew think of his apple watch?
Is he still watching apple tv plus is he still apologizing to tim cook? What's going on?
Tune in.
We're going to need that as a formal apology as well in writing that we'll put in the show
notes.
And in terms of formalities, I think we should thank Jean for her time with us today.
It is an early hour in Portland, Oregon.
Absolutely.
Thank you, Jean, for joining us at the lovely hour of 6am Pacific.
If people want to find out more about you, where might they go?
They can find me on micro.blog and my handle there is Macgenie, which is a holdover from
my Twitter days.
I tried to change, but I left it.
But in any case, yeah, I'm there.
If anybody is on Twitter listening to this, you can find me at the same name.
And that, oh, I have a podcast.
I have a few podcasts.
One is called The Weekly Review, which is sort of an attempt to stay on track with GTD
with my friend James Dempsey.
And if you're just into Star Trek, I have a podcast on the Incomparable Network called
Voyager Revisited.
>>Brett Henrichs I highly recommend The Weekly Review because
it's a great chance for you to not only do your own review, but also see if you were
able to get it done before either of them did. It's a fun challenge each week to see
where you land with them. Speaking of challenges, don't anyone forget
the upcoming photo challenge 13th to 14th of October. That's right.
Yes. Yep. micro.blog one photo, 24 hour period
day in the life. I can't wait to see it. I think it's gonna be awesome.
Cool. Well, thank you so much. Yeah, thank you. Take care.

Yay!
Ugh, only one crash.
It's good, Jean, that's good news.
I think any crash is good news because it's further justification for a new computer.
