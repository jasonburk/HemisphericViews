So much change so much change this is we've got no backups.

This is standard standard show nothing's different today.

We might as well go into what's different you know in case everything falls over what are the listeners enjoying today what are we doing differently what are you doing differently.

Okay so I'm I'm recording out of ghetto studio I'm I'm in a basement area.

Next to a small kitchen sink using a USB road podcast a microphone my very first podcasting microphone ever.

Should have suspended on a iPhone joey be stand grippy stand.

Upside down the little feet that not the number number feet are wrapped around the microphone and then the bit that's meant to hold the iPhone is actually serving as the foot.

So it's completely upside down I'm leaning sideways into my microphone I have no idea if it's recording.

And I've got my laptop perched on a cardboard box.

How's that different than every other week is not usually how you do it.

It'll probably sound better probably get to the end of it like cheese can you say amazing.

I'm editing this week so I'll just take full credit for it nothing to do with your setup it's just my masterful.

Audio treatment.

Okay yeah we'll put in the notes like how much work he had to spend like chopping things and correcting timing and all of that.

No no I'm worried but the changes don't stop there we've got more changes Jason do you want to talk us through the software side of things.

Yeah well when like you know whenever you're doing anything that's quote unquote live you want to introduce as many variables as you can at the same time so you have no idea why it crashed and burned so we've got your situation over there cardboard box studio be.

Yeah I'm leaning into a microphone I'm getting a sore back.

Leaning you look like you're in pain he's wincing every time he speaks actually so also we have our generally we use zoom as the back end I guess you could say for how we speak to each other see each other hear each other etc.

The interface.

The interface between us three as it's like a Bermuda Triangle with zoom in the middle basically is what that is but zoom is like really pretty costly for the fact that we use it like twice a month so we have this big fancy discord server that we also pay for so why not just try to use the audio and video of the discord server as our you know little intermediary between the three of us.

So we're doing that now which changes entirely how we record entirely how we do backup recordings.

Yeah so we don't have backup recordings this week so if you're hearing this.

Congratulations to us and to you as well listeners of episode 118 and or maybe you'll be hearing 119 instead we'll see.

I was just I think we only ever needed the backups twice so what are the odds really one in fifty fifty one in fifty five.

One in yeah fifty five.

One in forty five.

Forty five.

I just actually put the clip in there if you could just take me out and yeah you got it.

And you know what I had this is a separate topic up second but it is pretty much merged with this topic is to add to that complication and I don't think there should be any issues I have had to make a massive infrastructural upgrade to gong net do you want to hear about that.

Oh my gosh this is the trifecta yes yes we want to hear about gong that are you kidding me.

What's going on.

Yeah it wasn't just you two I was just trying to blame you to are you two with your changes but it's me.

Gong on.

What hasn't been gone on let me tell you one day it's just you know.

Internet seems a bit strange what's the deal.

Oh wait the modem router is dead and not just kind of like dead dead but like kind of undead flashing lights turning itself on and off bit of a disco party it was like we actually have this disco light that we plug into the PowerPoint Mac loves it you know we just put some music on turn the lights off and you got disco lights everywhere this was a shit disco light.

It's just lighting up for no reason we didn't ask it to do that right so I've gone well you know I often work from home you know we have good flexible work arrangements and I need to be able to do stuff at home that's not going to work so yeah.

Oh also home pods no longer work because they kind of rely on this shit we have no audio oh wait actually we don't have a terrestrial TV aerial it's all digital wait the whole house doesn't work anymore.

Oh no.

I've gone to get a new one Natasha's done the check on choice the website to see what's best and everything's coming up where you need to spend at least $400 on this thing that looks like a Cylon had sex with an RGB gamers keyboard.

$400.

Australian.

I know what's going on here.

Oh that's like $16,000 US.

Really what I'm feel like we're confused now.

It's just anyway everything's fine now I just wanted to say but the reason I bring it up is because on the one hand I'm happy that this thing works really well and you got your stupid little lights and you can customize we currently have it just set to a nice static glowing purple.

It's Max favourite colour because he loves eggplants or so he tells us doesn't really want to eat them but loves the purple of eggplants so it's currently set to purple.

Yeah loves purple you know like that deep purple that an eggplant is but it kind of verges on black or grey.

I'm not questioning his favourite colour I'm more questioning what on earth does purple mean in the realm of a router that doesn't mean anything.

I'll include a look I'll include a photo in the show notes and maybe in the artwork or whatever if you check it out listeners but yeah it actually.

What's the model number what you get.

Oh it's this.

It's this a soos Battlestar Galactica Cylon grade killer robot thing with four antennas coming out of it that you can put in different directions like.

Oh one of the spider ones it looks like a spider.

Does it.

You turned it upside down.

Oh shit I can't look at it now I was fine until you mentioned that.

You got you got the huntsman model.

I can't go in the kitchen anymore that's where it's sitting.

It's got a hairy antenna.

Hairy antenna now we're getting personal.

Gong that huntsman model B.

Oh wow.

Anyway it's all working really well look it's set up now but the reason I wanted to bring it up and I don't think it'll be stuffing up this shit like other elements of a new setup but modem routers okay I went to JB Hi-Fi really helpful guy said yep this is the one to go for I said now look.

Every time I've ever got a new modem router the setup process has been less than excellent has that changed and he said you'll find it's really easy you've got the app blah blah blah.

I'm not sure that I trust this but let's let's go with that I found the app right and the app actually looks really good it looks like it's quite easy to set up all of course the more expensive model that you've purchased is not compatible with the app setup.

Thank you asus.

Of course.

Does that make any sense.

So now I go into the realm of the stupid type your code thing in.

192.168.1.1 admin admin.

Yeah all that crap and then we go through it and I get to the end and it says.

Now we'll find and set itself up and all that bizzare.

Oh sure that worked no it's not into your account details interesting that at no point during the setup procedure did it ask me to set up an account so when I tried to create credentials it said those are incorrect you don't have that that doesn't exist you are now locked out of your modem router until the timer is up.

You didn't allow me the luxury of setting this up in the first place so I start the whole procedure again and I get there I've almost like I would never actually punch anything anyone is this into the show or knows me personally we know I've never punch anything but.

Closest to that Martin Felders ever got in anger to wanting to think about maybe punching something.

So anyway gone it's going well we have a purple light I might change it to a desirable disco light in the near future and get listeners just know if a salesperson tells you that modem routers are now easy.

Quote unquote to set up they are lying to you or living in some bizarre dreamland.

Have you already written your forty thousand word blog post about why the airport extreme should come back or is that forthcoming.

Look I was I was considering that I feel like everyone just knows it to be the case and maybe it's a waste of time writing it but yeah you heard it here first forty thousand word article on the airport extreme coming soon.

So man we've talked about NBN before.

Oh yes.

I'm presuming you are on fibre to the node with copper running to your home.

So you're in the video as I said the video sell hell so you have this stupid janky modem that's converting.

Copper signals back to something useful if there is any way anyway you can get fiber to the home I did that six months ago.

And it was the best upgrade not because you get faster speeds cuz I plans are still rubbish but you just put that point.

You have a thing in your box in your home and you literally just plug a router into it.

Yeah.

And there's no modem there's no stuff like that it's just an I just plug my hero into it and it is wonderful just for that so I encourage you and all other Australians listening if there's any way you can get fiber to the home.

Push for that solution.

Well let me tell you I live on a shared lot so it's like a strata plan and I think I've told you both before that we've had some let's say leakage issues between bathrooms and on suites and their adjacent rooms.

We just had our second one of those mid bathroom renovation because the.

Very kind gentleman who constructed this building the year before my birth didn't think that waterproofing was necessary so once we finished with the deluge that's molding up our carpet I will look into the possibility of.

Bringing our home into the 21st century in another aspect.

Happy to hear that I think you just knock down the house and start again.

Waterproofing first I think and then fiber probably.

Yeah but you're right because the whole copper thing for anyone who's unfamiliar with this perhaps overseas I have this beautiful little panel maybe I'll take a photo of this as well for the show notes a beautiful panel.

With this dangly wire coming out of where an old telecom or Telstra home phone would have been so it would have been so it's this beautiful little diagonal it's almost like a little.

I'm no circus rope thing I don't know like something that'll someone would slide down or like a flying fox just imagine a miniature person going down to the motor.

And that's your entire internet running through that cable.

The whole house runs on this little copper piece of shit coming out of the wall sorry I've sworn a few times this episode already I don't think I'll buy it up.

I feel like he's amped up a little bit a little bit amped up today internet.

There's a lot of shit this time.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I was getting amped up over the internet today I like it.

Well I've got something that can be down I guess something that'll just chill you right out Martin calm you right down.

Bring him right back to earth.

I'm gonna bring you right back to you Andrew Barry White Canyon and then let's bring it down a notch but it is musical.

It is musical it's not quite Barry White smooth.

Is it media corner then or.

Yeah it's media corner yeah yeah lock it in.

Actually you know what it's turbo media corner we haven't had one of those for a while Q turbo media corner.

Turbo media corner go.

Turbo media corner so thanks to Johnny our friend Johnny decimal and also my partner Lisa I have discovered new music new music a new music genre and it's something that I'm surprised and kind of disappointed that I didn't find out about like 30 years ago when it was actually new and it was a new music genre.

And it was on the scene.

Dubstep.

Yeah and it's not EDM but it is a music genre called shoegaze.

And shoegaze is basically it's kind of I like that there's different versions of shoegaze because I'm not an absolute thrash head I don't like the ones where the guitars go totally out of control I like the more mellow slightly electronica.

Kind of chill version of shoegaze music but it's really cool to listen to just just use.

Close your eyes and float away is the quite long songs they can go in different directions and it's really cool so name shoegaze because they use a lot of guitar she's a lot of the pedals with the feet.

So I can't performers would always be looking down at their feet the whole time they performing because not just playing the instrument in the hands of having to concentrate on which pedals do they push when to create loops and synth effects and they can't the vocals overwhelmed the music and then the music loops around there's a lot of.

Software interactions with the music perhaps or hardware interactions.

But this music is really good and Johnny Johnny has not only he's gone one step further he's recorded a whole bunch of him I should be saying this but he's recorded some radio programs from many years ago and he shared them with me and they're like shoegaze radio programs.

So thank you Johnny for sharing them I don't know if I'm allowed to say that is that breaking copyright who knows you can edit it out if not.

But if you haven't listened to it before try it out new genre only 25 or 30 years old.

The first place that my brain went to when you said I've been listening to shoegaze music was on closer inspection these are lawfors.

Very good.

I am one of the things if you want if you like she get if you like me like what she goes on it now the band to look for is a good start is slow dive.

Try them they're good start a band apparently right I'm still new to this too so I'm no expert and there's like another one called the postal department or the postal depth I think they called.

Check that but they're good to.

Is all of this instrumental or the vocals.

No vocals but sometimes you can't work out what the singing so it's it's almost like harmonic.

So you don't need to know the lyrics I'm going to give you the opportunity to wrap up this turbo media corner before we move on can you give us a line like your own singing impression of the best thing you've heard in shoegaze so far Andrew go.

No I can't.

Okay let me try this.

Sounds sounds great.

Just imagining staring at my own shoes while I listen to that listeners try it if you didn't do that before just rewind a bit in your player time shift as they say in podcast world and just look at your shoes while you listen to Andrew sing.

It'll take you to a special place unless you're driving please don't look at your shoes.

Yeah but I'll put your own pedals isn't at the point now when you're driving.

Eyes for me autonomous off you go in on your Tesla bank or tenant tenant to.

Now I'm excited for the that that was turbo media corner but this is the one I'm really here for I am so excited for this next topic I've been.

Actively looking forward to it I hope it delivers.

It's a counter chat alright so I feel like I might be going into an area that we've discussed before because we've spoken about coffees and preferred beverages and.

Names all that stuff and anyone who didn't listen to the last episode that we had with Kate and Megan names came up then all Kate chaos see Megan or Megan or Megan or Megan it's not names are a.

Who had been a troublesome area for some people but.

I want to tell you about a counter chat that I had recently and it's unfortunately a counter chat that I've had to have many times over the years it is a first world problem but I wanted to bring it out.

Into the open in case people could relate to it or find some solace in what I'm gonna say.

My name.

Despite being a fairly standard or be it not the most common name Martin is often misunderstood and I don't know why.

Longest time whenever I would order coffee and I found this particularly at uni when I started ordering coffees when I kind of first got into it.

I'd say Martin and it was so often misunderstood I get Matthews Marcus's marks all the time I just stopped saying Martin for a while I go to uni and I just choose names that I found would never be misunderstood.

And the most frequently used one that I employed over the counter was Vladimir I kid you not do you think it was ever misunderstood.

No do you never do you think it's because you weren't saying it correctly.

Well I would like it had you been saying Martin they maybe would have understood you.

Never that's the point I over enunciate right I say my name Martin with a clear T now I know no.

Martin except for Americans it would be Martin or Martin.

The T is there there's we're not arguing about the T at this point it's it's the it's the art are the more.

No but for an American I know how I'm saying it might be strange but in Australia every day same city I grew up in Martin.

The only thing that people maybe say differently about it is that they tend to swallow the T and go Martin.

Which I'm not going to say it that way because I can say the sound of the letter T and I'm not going to drop it okay that's non-negotiable for me.

I don't think you're dropping the T I think you're dropping the I because you're still saying Martin.

That's because we use the schwa like when I used to work with the Germans in Sydney previous job long story for the people think that you work with the Germans German business chamber past life they would say Martin.

Okay they're very committed to the tin okay now I'm not going to say it that way because people might think that I'm strange if I'm not German so get that out of the way I'm Martin people say Martin that's it.

Hang on what if we.

Anyway.

What.

No I'm going to stop you here.

What if we bring together the nations and we take the we take them the the T of the Australian.

The in of the German and the R of the American.

What does that sound like.

Then you would be more tinned.

Well just looking at the face that you had to pull to say that properly I think I'm going to be in trouble at cafes are going to be like call the police this man has an issue.

Or or an ambulance because he's having a stroke.

Yeah or just both everyone's in danger.

Alright.

Yeah.

Anyway so I'm saying my name the way that I would normally say it which in everyday conversation otherwise is not misunderstood right.

And I would say Vladimir and people go you know where is Vlad and I'm like well what the hell.

Anyway then I wanted to stop saying that because then I'd be daydreaming and then forget that I was Vladimir and then not go and pick up the coffee in time.

That's an issue.

So I just went back to my normal name moved on and I have told this kind of story to numerous people over time including my team at work.

And just the other day we went to a cafe and they've heard me say it before but I think they just thought yeah whatever Martin's not that strange a name so that's fine.

They probably just went he's talking too much again and we got there and it was this new person at a cafe that we've been to many times and they said oh your name please.

And I said Martin and the person went I'm sorry.

And I thought here we go and I said Martin and they said Max.

I was like I don't know where you got that sound from that's what I thought I didn't say it to them and I said no no Martin M A R T I N.

And they said oh Marty.

Now I didn't say Marty you don't know me okay.

Marty I allow for people who know me but I said and you would have gone wow this is Feldfoot territory they said oh Marty and I said no Martin.

And they've kind of given this slight look of oh and I was like I'm not cranky but you asked me my name we've been through this four or five times now and we've reached the conclusion that my name is Martin.

Anyway.

Was this was this directly after the whole router modem situation or.

No no I mean it's within the same week that there's been leakages between rooms and actually yeah it's it's in the aftershock of the modem.

It's building it's building.

Everything's been very interesting.

You're having a bad week.

So I wasn't cranky with this person I was just kind of baffled again that Martin was so so difficult to understand.

Go ahead Marty.

Anyway one of the people on my team went wow actually you were you were right it's the thing and I said well let's see what happens let's see if they call your names out.

They called their names out for the others in my team but when it came to mine they just said double shot flat white.

No name was uttered and I was like clearly we have entered a very very complex name territory.

So yeah that's counter chat.

Wow that's passive aggressive chat where we just say your drink order now we don't even want to mention you anymore.

Thanks Max.

Yep.

Um can you please next time you order coffee can you please try being Jason.

Jason.

Try Jason see how that goes.

You can you can say all of those letters like perfectly fine so.

Yeah.

That should be no problem.

Thank you Jason.

And then there might be there might be a nerdy barista and they'll say do you mean Jason or do you mean Jason.

Oh.

That's a good one.

Just own.

Yes on could be a yes on.

Yes.

So why Martin it's just difficult Jason say say Martin one more time please.

Michael.

What I'm thinking you need to do you need to record Jason saying Martin Martin Martin.

Mar I say.

I say it like it's a said Martin.

Okay record that and just hold your phone up and just say I'm and Jason's voice comes out saying Martin.

Hello barista that's not a wrong that I want to enter.

No thank you Andrew.

I could just call ahead if that would be helpful I could call the I could call the coffee shop order it for you.

And then you just have to listen out for the name.

Perfect yeah.

I think this is what we should do.

I would love this would be a great counter chat future episode you think about it.

You want me to walk up to someone and seriously play audio pre-recorded by a podcast co-host they

don't know just to see if my coffee arrives and what happens when they tell me the price.

Do I have to have like custom buttons that are ready to go you know.

We'll design a shortcut.

What if we're on FaceTime and you just say you order yours and then I'll order one also.

But I will order it for you.

I feel like all of the burden is now on me and Jason by extension when other people could just

listen and say the name properly.

Well.

Well there is that.

Clearly that doesn't work so we need to work around it.

I think I just have to be Vladimir again.

I don't know why this is a topic but it is.

I've been using a remarkable tablet slash pen thingy pencil thingy whatever you want to call it.

E Ink tablet is probably the correct name.

And we've talked about them before.

We talked about one probably about 100 episodes ago maybe something like that.

It's nothing new.

Everybody knows about this.

It's not like I'm talking about the remarkable three which by the way should be out any day now

that I've purchased a remarkable two.

Well if you bought one.

Yeah.

They're a little long in the tooth at this point.

But just to say if you've been on the fence and you're still thinking about getting one

it's a great little device.

I love it for writing down notes with a pencil because I write on

notebooks and then I lose the notebook or I lose the piece of paper.

Don't know where it went.

This turns all my scratch into text so I can put it into regular notes that are searchable later.

And the biggest mind blown emoji that came out of this was it's an E Ink tablet.

You can just read like PDFs and e-books on it.

It's a giant e-book reader instead of those tiny little stupid Kindle screens.

It's a huge screen to read a full sized book.

So if you're into reading books on E Ink it's freaking great for that.

No it doesn't have backlight or any of that stuff but it's a phenomenal device.

It's as thin as a USB C cable.

It's great.

I love it.

I think it's really cool.

I think the writing action is yes I have an iPad with an Apple pencil.

I think writing on it absolutely sucks.

I just hate it.

I agree.

I don't think it's good.

It's passable.

It's fine but it is by no means a replacement for paper and just that feeling.

Yeah you could put a screen thingy on there I guess but now you've kind of like

compromised the other 99% that is the point of an iPad.

I don't know.

I'm just I'm not into the writing on an iPad thing.

It's great.

I know you both like do all the edits with the pencil like it's great for that but I

think for literally handwriting I don't think the iPad's good for me.

Maybe it's great for you.

That's fine.

But Remarkable 2 from a writing standpoint like purely writing I've yet to use

anything that's even close.

So Remarkable 2 you're welcome for when the Remarkable 3 comes out probably next week.

Awesome.

Jason.

Yeah.

There's an opportunity in the market for you as well.

So you will recall that yeah we talked about the Remarkable before and as a result I actually

had a coupon over at canyon.blog/save.

So I've just gone and checked that coupon and clicked it and it tells me this code

has expired.

The referral program ended May 3rd 2024.

So I don't know if your new purchase comes with a referral code but there is a clear

gap in the market for a /save opportunity on the tablet.

So you might want to get in there with your own grep Jason.

/save.

You gonna do that?

I'd have to set that up first but I'll look into it.

I'll tell you I'll tell you what I will I will give it I will give it a look.

And actually.

No promises.

It's remiss of me something speaking of savings and business corner.

Martin I forgot to ask you earlier when your modem died did you calculate how much it cost

you per week?

What do you think the answer to that question is?

I'm thinking no and I'm thinking you also just went out and bought a new one and didn't

record it in a spreadsheet at all.

Look here's how I view it having to go out and buy one in the first place was a waste

of my time so to do that more with the spreadsheet stuff although I appreciate and respect that

it's valuable to you.

That would have been more of a waste of my time so time is my currency and I don't need

to waste time in recording it.

Do you need me to set up another tab in my spreadsheet?

No no no I'd prefer that you didn't.

If you want to record it just out of your own personal interest on your end just so

you can track data for others that's fine go for it I think that would be wonderful

for you I don't want that.

You don't want a management report emailed to you monthly?

No no no it would go directly to spam.

When did you get the modem?

Last week I think I don't know I kind of blocked out my memory.

Easy it's $200 a week.

Perfect there you go.

Problem solved.

I think it's great that you do it Andrew and I'm grateful that you have it as a recurring

statement on this show because I feel like 70% of the listenership is here for updates

on that spreadsheet.

But it's the only reason I do the show.

Not for me.

Yeah it's your channel to air your depreciation facts that's it we're just the you know up

front audience.

I just got to get past all your boring shit so I can wear myrially cells in your spreadsheet.

You've been using me this whole time as a cell.

Bloody counter chat can we just talk depreciation?

Jeez Martin and his stupid social observations.

No one can pronounce my name.

When are we going to get to the spreadsheet?

And look we're back into it and we were talking about Remarkables and stuff but I just want

to say before we move on Jason.

Yeah.

I like the way you kind of talk about the fact that writing's not great on the iPad.

I think they have really done things to make it better as an artistic tool and I'm not

really artistic enough to use things like the pencil in that way and I don't really

want to handwrite with it and I do love the ferrite audio editing aspect but the fact

that you're using the Remarkable in that way and you're distinguishing it as a device I

think too much we hear people kind of trying to replace something like the iPad or insert

any other device from any other brand with something else.

I think what you're saying is the Remarkable has its strengths and you use it for what

it's good for the way that you do with the iPad.

It's not the same thing.

Yeah.

No, it's definitely a different device and if you were only going to have one device

then I think there's no question you would get an iPad.

Right.

Because it just does, you know, it's a computer.

It does everything.

But if you're in a position to where you want a specific like specialized device for

writing, handwriting specifically, I think that's the way to go.

It's just, you know, with things like palm rejection on the iPad are great but palm

rejection/hand rejection on something like the Remarkable is a hundred percent.

Your hand physically is incapable of making a mark on the E-ink.

It can't.

Like technically it's impossible.

The only thing that can do it is that pencil.

So like, you know, akin to paper where your hand is not, other than your hand smearing

your pencil across the paper, which can't happen with this.

So another benefit.

Your hand is not writing on the paper.

So it's just that kind of same one-to-one feeling.

It's the most one-to-one feeling I've ever seen in a device that is, you know, digital.

So yeah.

Cool.

Really good if you're looking for that kind of thing.

I think it's the way to go.

I had a lot of people ask me like, "Oh, well, why not the Kindle whatever theirs is

called, Scribe maybe, I think is what it's called, which does the pencil thing as well."

I think it's just a choice.

I don't use anything Amazon related, so I don't need the Kindle-y stuff.

If you're all in on Kindle stuff, then yeah, probably get the Kindle one.

That seems pretty obvious that that would make more sense for you.

Technology-wise, I don't know if there's a huge difference between them.

I haven't tried them both.

Again, I don't use Amazon, so I didn't even look at the Amazon one.

But I think more to the point, the e-ink is the key feature there that's really good.

All kinds of stores have them to try out.

So if you're curious, just go try one out and write on it for a while because it's a

very interesting and eye-opening experience when you write on something that is e-ink

and with that texture.

It's just very different.

So there you go.

Remarkable too.

Boom.

Slash save.

You were just talking about the type of screen.

Now you've been on another podcast talking about screens.

I don't remember you asking for permission to do this.

Man.

What's the deal?

Look at this.

Michael is remarkable at Segways today, I have to say.

I know.

It's not my...

It's Max.

I'm just hyped up on gong-net energy today and frustration.

Not actually, it's all for show on the podcast.

I'm actually really pretty chilled.

Jason, it's not for show.

It's not for show.

No, he's pissed.

He's so angry.

Nick is not happy about what's going on right now.

We've already made him install Discord.

Geez.

Yeah.

Can I do a quick...

Are we allowed to do cross promo?

Is that in our contract?

I think so.

Oneprimeplus.com.

Oh, well, yeah, I wasn't actually going to cross promo oneprimeplus.com, but now you've

said it.

Oneprimeplus.com is for all of your one prime plus needs.

By the way, episode 041 for one prime plus members only is in the feed.

You haven't heard it, probably because you don't have one prime plus.

So get over there to oneprimeplus.com and sign up today.

It's in the long game.

And it did take us a while to put that episode out.

Thank you very much, members, for waiting for that one.

That was from the vault.

So when we say it's in the long game, we really aren't kidding.

So thanks for waiting.

Everything, every bit of it is in the long game, and you don't know how long it's going

to be.

So surprise.

Great.

Um, I was actually going to cross promo something else, but thank you for the additional one

prime plus mention.

Never hurts.

We had a guest recently, a couple of episodes back, uh, Lee, I was talking to him about

the, one of those, one of those newfangled Android phones and he has re kickstarted,

uh, re kickstarted.

Does that even make sense?

Probably not.

He has rebooted.

Yeah.

Maybe is a better relaunched.

Refreshed.

Yeah.

Whatever.

Um, resurrection, uh, his podcast called home screens, which I think is a, is a fun,

fun idea.

It is since we've had these stupid phones in our pockets, we've always talked to each

other about different home screens, what apps are using, what wallpaper is that?

Like we're, it's kind of the constant among all these devices since the beginning of time.

So he's having people on the show to just literally talk through their home screens.

He did the first episode and now he's just done the second episode that I was on.

So I just wanted to share if anybody's interested in that kind of stuff, which I think everybody

probably is.

And you want to hear me ramble on about my home screen and what's going on with it and

why, uh, check it out.

It's the link will be in the show notes.

It's called home screens.

It's episode two.

I don't think he is like a cadence yet for releasing, but, um, yeah, add it to your podcast

player of choice and, uh, check it out.

So there you go.

Home screens.

Thanks for sharing.

And three, no, no.

Finish two.

Hey, Oh, are we still going?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

We got the next topic.

Uh, we got two topics.

Best things in life are free.

Yeah, I can't remember the rest of it, but you know where I'm going.

I, so I'm going to just say there was a non-zero hope and wish in my mind when I wrote out

the line item there that that was going to invoke a song and maybe dance.

We don't know.

Sometimes we get both and it delivered.

So I'm already 50% of the way there on this topic.

Um, yeah.

So I don't know.

This is a weird one.

I was curious.

I'm going to just, I'm going to deliver this.

And then I want to know if both of you have anything happening in your lives in this area.

So, uh, recently you will remember there was the panic garage sale, panic, the company

moving offices had a garage sale, which did not involve a garage.

It was more of an office.

So it was more of an office sale, but that's okay.

Where they sold a bunch of stuff, different people that work there had little tables set

up to sell stuff.

It was great overall.

I think it was phenomenal.

A little event.

It was really fun.

It was great to see everybody.

It was just a cool time to kind of hang out and buy random stuff.

One of the tables, the person was not there because they were, they were ill and they

had a little sign up that just said, every, everything on this table free, just take it.

It doesn't matter.

Like whatever, just have it.

And I was like, Oh, that's, that's interesting.

And there was a lot of things on this table.

There was like everything from like little knickknacks to like, do you remember the 17

inch studio display way back in the day, the like kind of clear with the lines going down,

there was one of those just sitting there.

There was all kinds of just random stuff.

And, um, one specific item caught my eye and that particular item was, I'm going to show

you, I'll take a picture of it and share it with everybody.

A tiny wooden radio that has selectable modes for Bluetooth.

So you can Bluetooth things to it.

It has an aux in, and it has an FM dial.

All three built into this little tiny USB plugin, little wood, it's made of wood, uh,

radio.

It looks like an old time radio from like the fifties.

I saw that.

I thought, Oh my gosh, I don't know what it is, but I want it.

It's adorable.

It's a tiny wooden radio.

I picked it up.

I kind of looked around for somebody that was there to be like, are these actually like,

can we just, like, these are free.

It just felt weird to just be like, yoink, this is mine.

Now, even though there was clearly a sign there that said like, this is all free, it

still felt like, I don't know.

And they were like, yeah, take it.

So I, I grabbed it.

I brought it home.

I got a few other things there while I was there, but this little wooden radio, I don't

know who makes it.

I don't know what it costs originally has brought me so much joy in the last few weeks,

just Bluetooth thing to it and having, I listened to a lot of like old time radio stuff.

So stuff from like thirties, forties, fifties, and Bluetooth thing that through this tiny

little one speaker, wooden radio gives it a level of authenticity that is just unremarkable

compared to listening through it, like a home pod or a big studio display.

It's just, it gives it the right amount of that little tinny-ness and kind of mononess.

It's like actual retro future that like the actual past brought to now, but futuristic,

kind of not real.

I don't know.

Wow.

Yeah.

I'm playing an MP3 of a recording of something from like 1940 through my phone, Bluetooth

to a tiny radio that's powered by batteries and made of wood.

Jeez.

It's just like, what?

But it has just been like, I would have paid for, if I had to like put a dollar value on

just the amount of happiness that has brought me over the weeks, it would just be so much

money yet.

It was just this little thing on a table that no one wanted.

And I picked, I just happened to pick it up.

So I don't know where this story is going, but it just was, it was one of those moments

of life where you're like, you know, sometimes the weirdest things happen that you just don't

expect.

So there's my tiny wood radio story for you.

And I'm curious if that has ever happened to you at like a, I don't know if you call

them garage sales or like estate sales or whatever they are referred to there.

But yeah, I don't, Andrew go.

No.

Hold on.

No, I have a.

I'll call you out.

No, I never go to such things.

Businesses here never have those sorts of things.

That's way too interesting and fun.

So we just don't have that kind of stuff happen here.

So my answer is very short, no, but I will add some value because I will say the next

thing I want you to Bluetooth through that little speaker is that song.

The best things in life are free.

Okay.

I can do that.

Thank you.

Yeah.

And while you're setting that up, Jason, I'm just going to say also I'm boring.

No, I do like going to like to secondhand bookshops or secondhand sections and bookshops

and finding things like that.

And there are some sort of knickknack shops around, but nothing that I could really say

that would match that.

And I feel like it would just bring the whole segment down.

So cue the music if we're actually allowed to do that.

Oh, that's a copyright strike.

There's no way we're allowed to play that.

Did you just say knickknack, Max?

Yeah, I did.

I did Aaron.

Yeah.

So can I just, something else that he might want to play through that little box.

Knickknack, paddywhack, give it all the bone.

This old man came rolling home.

Oh, shit.

I'm dying at all of the like not correct M names.

What was that, Jimmy?

Good one.

We've lost Jordan.

No, I'm here.

I'm here.

I'm here.

Okay.

Okay.

Oh, man.

Sorry.

Friend of the show.

I don't know if he's a friend of the show.

I don't know if he listens.

He's on Microblog, Jared Blundy.

He's written some really cool shortcuts.

He's a friend of the show.

Yeah.

I think he has been before.

Oh, yeah, he is, isn't he?

I had him on RSS.

That's right.

Hey, dingus.

So he has written some really cool shortcuts.

One of them is for putting GIFs, like your meme GIFs and stuff on.

Like presents?

What?

Or GIFs.

Oh, no, GIFs.

GIFs.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

So.

Oh, boy.

Now we're really cancelled.

Those things.

So being able to upload them to your Microblog storage and then get a markdown link to them.

And so you can recycle them over and over again in your blog posting.

And I thought that's really cool.

And the shortcut is really clever, the way it lets you select from ones you've already uploaded.

I'm right at the beginning of using it because I only found it this morning.

But one of the things it also, it allows the use of open AI to generate alt text of the meme as well.

So it kind of is helpful for people who don't have the ability to see the GIF or GIF.

Anyway, I tried it and then I realised that you needed credits to make the open AI function work.

Because it uses the GPT-4-0.

So I was like, ah, stuff it.

I'm going to do it.

I'm going to put five, I bought five bucks worth of open AI access.

Wow.

It's only open AI API.

So because if you want to use like normal chat GPT, it's like 20 bucks a month or something,

which is, I don't use it nearly enough to bother with that.

But now I have five dollars of open AI API.

And apparently using this shortcut uses like 0.1 cents of it or something.

So I could be posting GIF memes for the rest of my life and probably not get through five dollars.

So what can I do with five dollars worth of API credits?

I need ideas, please.

I have no idea.

That's my contribution.

You could generate a list of names that start with M to call Martin for the rest of the show.

And also, how do I like if I have API access, that's kind of implying that I'm a programmer,

right?

Aren't you?

And I would be calling it programmatically.

And I don't know how to do that.

Why don't you use it for every image that you do instead of just these GIFs?

I don't know how.

Then.

I reckon, no, actually, if you can find some way for open AI, if this is your jam,

right, if this is what you want to do to fuel your depreciation spreadsheet, formulas,

input, whatever, macros, there's an M word.

I don't even know if that has anything to do with what you're doing.

Hmm.

Make it happen.

That should be your next name at the coffee shop.

I'm macro.

Yeah, that sounds good.

Mason.

Mason.

Max.

Mock.

Go with Mocker.

Mateo.

Be Mocker.

I'm not going to call myself Mocker.

Yeah, yeah.

And then they'll think that you're ordering a Mocker.

And then you'll be like, no, no, no, no, I didn't order a Mocker.

I am Mocker.

Marcus.

I'm hanging up now.

Maximo.

God.

Mario.

It's a Mia.

All right, count us down.

Oh, man.

I'm trying to think of one more M word.

Morgan.

Moron.

How about Moron?

Oh, Morgan.

Not Moron.

Don't be so hard on yourself.

Do we do Matthew?

I've had Matthew.

Don't worry about that.

Oh, okay.

Maestro.

Yeah, well, let's go with Maestro.

I'll take that one.

Mitchell.

Mitchell.

Mitchie.

Mitch.

Ah, you're still here.

Thanks for sticking around.

You've stumbled upon a very special little listener corner at the end of this episode.

And you know what?

We're going to feature a pretty interesting piece of music that was submitted on our hemispheric

discord by listener Jacoby or quadruple X as he goes by his username.

And look, I'm not going to say anything else other than what Jacoby wrote in the discord,

which was Canyon was SingScat beatboxing on episode 29 of the One Prime Plus feed.

So I was inspired to make this.

Thanks very much for going to the effort, Jacoby.

This is great.

Take it away.

[Applause]

- Whoa!
