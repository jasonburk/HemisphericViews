Music.

How's your setup looks precarious still.

I'm back in Trash Studio.

Lean leaning over my microphone do you know it was ironic last week how I joked that I would probably sound better than I usually do and I don't know about anybody else but in playback I think I sounded better.

Does that door need to be shut or is that part of the acoustical treatment.

No that's part of the acoustic behind that door is a toilet.

Ok ok.

Oh how come we don't get any like toilet flushing that would have been great in the last episode.

This is the the an old sort of granny flat band room.

Gimp room.

So the situation.

Ok.

Can you promise me in like future episodes of I don't know keep practicing or in Bill pocket podcast Raven this one it's like Andrew Canyon coming to you from Trash Studios.

You can add a toilet flush.

What why do we all sound a bit croaky tonight I think today or whenever the time is why are we croaky.

I'm going to assume croaky is is tired is that what is croaky.

Well Martin you you inflicted this upon us so can you just explain to us and the listeners what is going on.

Well as far as I'm aware there are like Father's Day plans when we normally.

You know record so there's stuff in the way so here we are you know so it's now what midnight just after midnight my time on a Saturday morning.

It's late in the evening for you Andrew on a Friday and Jason you've woken up slightly early.

On a Friday morning to do this is that right.

I like how you think it's slightly earlier.

How much earlier.

You have no idea when I get up.

When do you get up.

I'm I'm like a good I'm like a 839 kind of person.

Wow.

Every day.

Sure yeah.

Do you have a job.

Why are you.

Okay well I am sorry.

Yeah it's a I like I like a good sleep.

I'm coming off asleep I actually just had a nap on the couch I wasn't meaning to but I was watching TV and you know that feeling when your eyes are just getting like heavy and you like raising your whole forehead up to try and keep your eyelids open.

And then eventually the way to do the camp.

I'm from you know the pigs on the back of the head.

But it's good I had just to keep the eyes open I had like a 30 minute power nap I am good to go like who got look guys I've even got my my beverage of late night choice a little bit of red wine keep me going keep it all set times.

I'll wake you right up.

Well I'm feeling fired up I just watched France beat the Netherlands in Paralympic wheelchair tennis it was spectacular and yeah fired up.

You know it gets people really fired up in the hemisphere you views universe.

What's that one for a plus dot com one prime plus.

Dot com where is it Vladimir is in long game it is in long game.

You've earned your flat white good job no problem thank you.

I just wish we had more of them like usually we have we have like one maybe two how many do we have to shout out today on this August 30th slash whatever day it is for you all can you count do you need like a spreadsheet like like a formula is there a formula that there is.

Add it up for us there is add add up all the fingers on one hand.

Does the answer this formula.

Oh cuz we were not counting a thumb as a finger.

No no no.

Oh ok just fingers not thumbs if you're going to count was a finger would be called a finger is called a thumb so it's clearly not a finger.

If you're going to count on those which one do you start with.

We've been through this haven't we.

I think the thumb would be a finger or a finger I didn't actually hear what you said.

No no no if the thumb was a finger it would be a finger but it's not a finger it's a thumb so therefore it's not a thing finger.

What's a big toe because I don't think the big toe gets this kind of you know.

You're right.

It's not a it's not.

No it says who the big toes not a toe it's called the big toe.

It's not a foot thumb you don't call it a foot thumb.

No that's a good point so we have so we have 10 toes but 8 fingers.

Well the thumb is special it it go you know your big toe is not you're not doing the same kind of motion with it it is more in line as a toe.

I've seen some family members with interesting dexterity with their big toes I can tell you it's not quite a possible but it may as well be.

Yeah if it.

Just imagine the Feld family foot situation just all trying to impress each other at the same time.

I know that's too scary to even think about.

Every family events just a lot of big toes converging on each other.

It's like a foot thumb convention.

Oh my goodness.

So 1 Prime Plus.

Anyway yeah why are we here again?

Yeah that's right 1 Prime Plus.

1 Prime Plus that's right.

How did we get down foot thumb alley?

1 Prime Plus members thank you for joining.

You said we had what was that 4?

4 to shout out?

Yes one hands with.

Woo Type 45 see you later.

All right let's get into our 1 Prime Plus appreciation corner.

There's a corner for this now.

Starting off with Stephen M.

Thank you Stephen M.

Much appreciated.

Standing next in line.

Lee P.

Thank you Lee.

Lee P.

Is he Lee P?

Next in line.

Josh W.

And finally.

Double F.

Francine F.

That's 4.

1 2 3 4 X.

1 Prime Plus.com members have joined the chat.

That's incredible.

Thank you all.

Don't forget stickers, benefits, you've got podcasts, you got extra show clips,

you've got so many great benefits.

But most of all you're now a 1 Prime Plus member.

The greatest benefit of all.

But now you can go to you can go to work.

You can go to the grocery store.

You can go to your local bookstore and say hi, I'm a 1 Prime Plus member.

And most likely they won't do anything with that.

But in your heart of hearts, you know that you are a 1 Prime Plus member.

So thank you.

And if you want to be a 1 Prime Plus member, simply load your favorite web browser of choice.

Entering www.1primeplus.com.

Follow the links, follow the prompts and you'll be on your way.

Do you think the www works?

I actually don't know.

I hope not because I found it annoying.

It wheelie wheelie works.

I was actually filling in a web form just the other day and I typed in a web address.

I had a URL I had to and I just put, you know, no W's.

And it actually complained.

It said not a valid website address and it wouldn't.

I was like, oh, I didn't put the HTTP in.

So I put the HTTP in, not a valid website address.

It's like, huh?

I was like, ah.

I hate to break it to you, www.

And then it worked.

1 Prime Plus, www.1primeplus.com actually does not work.

Oh, bloody hell.

I guess I'll have to go look at that.

Just think about how much money we've left on the table from people trying to go www.

Everybody go in there.

That's the real problem.

Okay, we've identified the core issue here of why there are not thousands of 1 Prime Plus members.

It's because the www.

Because we were never on the World Wide Web.

We were never there, ever.

Damn it.

All right, I'll have to look at that.

Good bug finding, Andrew.

Good job.

Thank you for joining.

Four members, all four fingers.

They are in the fold now.

So what is, I see a lot of basketball emojis here.

There's like a lot of them.

More, it looks like a high school gym in these notes.

Where do you want to start?

Except for where there aren't basketballs, where I feel like Andrew's gotten a bit lazy.

Oh, yeah.

There are some.

Let's see what happens.

Huh, okay.

Well, let's, first topic seemed very appropriate for right now.

So go ahead.

Okay, so this is, let this be a lesson to, I want to educate past Andrew.

So future Andrew can learn.

So when you write show notes, make them just a slightly bit more copious than three words.

Because I'm looking at this topic and it says basketball emoji.

I couldn't sleep.

Yeah, I don't know what I was talking about.

I don't know what that is in reference to.

Was that while you were struggling to fall asleep, but you were sleepy and you wrote it and now you've forgotten.

It must have been.

And now you're sleepy and you can't remember why you were saying that.

Oh, no, maybe it was this.

I know what it was.

It's a good, yes, I remember now.

This is a good podcast.

Yeah, go for it.

I need to write better notes.

So the other week I couldn't sleep and I woke up in the middle of the night.

And I sent a message out to the Hemispheric News chat.

I think it was on the chat.

I think it was just a chat between the three of us.

I don't think it was on Discord, but I think I just said like, I can't sleep and I was annoyed.

And Jason was around because obviously he's got the benefit of a 12 hour time difference or whatever it is.

And he said, get up.

I remember this now.

Yeah, I was asleep, I think.

Yeah, and he told me to walk to the couch and sit on the couch and stay on the couch sitting until you're so bored of the room and then go back to bed and fall asleep.

I think if we play it back, though, that's not exactly what I said.

That's what you did, which was in - which was a loose interpretation of what I actually told you to do.

Well, you told me to go and sit on the couch.

So I went and laid on the couch.

No, I fell asleep for three hours on the couch.

Here we go.

I'll read it to you.

So what do you guys do at 2.30 a.m.

When you've woken up and can't get back to sleep?

Jason responds, I get out of bed.

Use restroom if needed.

Go to another room in the house.

Sit on the floor doing nothing.

Wait until I am very bored of that room.

Then go back to bed and go back to sleep.

Andrew responds, thanks.

I'm on the couch now.

Jason responds, no, not couch.

It has to be floor.

The lack of comfort is a key component.

And then Andrew responds, I fell asleep on the couch.

Then went back to bed three hours later.

Jason, that is not what I told you to do, Andrew.

Andrew, I failed you.

Jason, you can make it up to me later.

And then I woke up and then I started talking.

Thank you.

Thank you for the court replay.

Now that we have the record straight.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that people, you don't need sleep music.

You don't need pussies.

You don't need anything to help you fall asleep at night.

You just need a couple of little motivational messages from Jason.

And you'll be well on your way to sleeping.

Thank you, Jason.

Disciplinary ones at that.

Pussies.

That is like a way throwback.

That is so old.

Oh my gosh.

That's like Macworld 2001 or whatever.

That was so long ago.

I still have that installed on my phone.

I didn't even know it was on the phone.

I thought that was like pre-phone.

Well, it was.

It had a little, it was a little device.

It was the best thing.

I fell asleep to Pussies like every night for about six years, I reckon.

That guy's voice was like amazing.

This is one for the show notes, definitely.

I remember meeting that guy.

I think it was Macworld, like whatever, Macworld 1.

And he was in the, I don't remember what it was called, but there was always

that little area of like tiny booths.

Tiny Town.

Yeah.

He was there.

And I think it, I assume maybe it was the first one.

And we were just kind of walking through and looking at all the different

little tiny apps and stuff.

And I remember sitting there talking to this guy for a while.

About Pussies.

I think it was the name.

Because I saw it.

I was like, what the hell is a Pussies?

First of all, like are all the domain names gone?

I guess so.

Because here we are with Pussies.

And yeah, it was, it was one of those, I, for whatever reason, I just very

vividly remember talking to him about Pussies for way longer than I feel

like I should have.

Well, if you have a bump into him again, tell him, tell him the address is

thanks.

I will do that.

I assume it's still going.

Is there, is it www.pussies?

Or it should be given its age.

Let's see.

HTTP.

Probably not S. Pussies is one up on OnePrime Plus because www.pussies

actually works.

So there you go.

Wow.

It's so modern looking now.

It's not as good.

I like the old one.

Look at this.

Yeah.

Jump the shark.

Got too fancy.

Tried to fit, tried to add too many features.

My sleep music app jumped the shark.

Is that a showtime?

Could be.

Yeah.

Well, thank you for the dramatic reenactment.

I wish we could, I wish we had like an animator or like an artist person

on our payroll so that they could kind of reenact that chat with little

stick figures or something.

I think that'd be really exciting.

We don't have that.

So when we do at some point, you know, if we keep getting four OnePrime

Plus members every show, I will hire an animator to animate little

scenes like that.

So there you go.

It could actually be a payroll.

Yeah, it could be.

There could be a need to put numbers into boxes and send payments via

electronic fund transfer.

We'll see.

Someday.

Someday.

This next basketball, we've discussed talking during haircuts before

and I'm really interested to see what Andrew has done given that history.

I have a concern just right out of the gate, just quickly.

I'm not going to spoil your title here, but I'm concerned that this

wasn't actually at a counter and now you're just kind of umbrellaing

everything under this title.

I don't know.

We'll see.

Go ahead.

Okay.

Okay.

So counter chat.

I was at the hairdresser.

Look at this dude.

It's lovely.

You look lovely.

Lovely lady was cutting.

Sorry.

Check that.

Lovely woman was cutting my hair.

I've been schooled recently.

You shouldn't say lady.

You should say woman.

But like old man Canyon struggle struggling to learn new things.

Lovely, lovely woman cutting my hair and I just was like chatting to

her and like having a good time and she said to me, it's so nice to

have somebody who's willing to have a little chat.

What life can get boring if I'm just sitting here cutting people's

hair and you're like a really happy guy and it's great to have you

here and then she asked me if I was a regular and I said no.

I just I've been here a couple of times but very sporadic very

sporadic.

I said, but yeah, we had a good chat and then there was an old bloke

and all blood came in.

He sat in the chair the other side.

He had a little he had lots of those old blokes sayings that were

really good, you know, like I'll go see what what news is in the

paper today.

See, you know, I can't even think I can't even speak like old bloke.

I'm just butchering it.

It's late at night.

I'm sorry.

It was a good chat.

Good chat.

Good chat.

And then it was like going so well and I went to pay and I tried to pay

and I tried to pay and like yeah, it was I used the wrong card by

accident and it wasn't so much that it was insufficient funds is that

it was a card that is connected to a whole salary packaging thing.

It work and it turns out and you're only allowed to use it for meals

and entertainment.

And I thought I found this counter chat to be very entertaining.

So therefore I justify this haircut as my entertainment like who can

judge whether I found it entertaining or not.

Other than me.

I think the finance department will so I used the meals and entertainment

card thinking yes, haha.

And I did it and then because the f-plus machines, I don't know if you

know this but f-plus machines have like merchant codes attached to them

that kind of identify what business type of business it is and because

that merchant code would have communicated to the bank and it would

have said no, this is a hairdresser place.

It's not entertaining.

Your card is declined.

And so after this one, but she didn't know that to her mind.

It just looked like I didn't have any money and it just sort of killed

the whole experience because we had a good laugh and a good time.

But then I look like a poverty stricken bozo and I had to say no,

I've got it.

I've got it and like quickly try and sort of Apple pay on a different

card and I was like, oh, so what a mix up how silly but I felt deep

shame thinking that she thought I had no money but it was just because

I thought the hairdresser was entertaining.

She's like, who's this polite but very poor man.

Did you not tell her this 45-minute story to explain it?

I didn't know how to how do you explain that I've got this card that is

for entertainment.

I mean, she doesn't like this is special benefit.

I have for working in an Australian cup organization.

That's a not-for-profit and there's special tax laws and they give

you this benefit.

If you apply for a solution, I've got a solution.

Okay, here you go.

You're going to go back.

To get another haircut, you have to wait because you don't want to go

back.

Now, you already have a haircut.

Yeah, go to eight weeks.

You're going to casually casually drop off a thumb drive with this

episode on it.

Okay, I just got to listen to it.

Get this whole hour-long conversation and to understand what happened

in the past right here about one prime plus and the benefits that it

has to you personally.

She'll think she's helping you out.

She'll become one prime plus member.

She will have the whole backstory of what happened last time.

Have a laugh.

Ha ha ha ha ha all is forgiven.

And we have a new one prime plus member.

So there you go.

Counter chat.

I like some counter chat.

Counter chat.

Counter chat is happy.

Counter chat is jolly.

Counter chat brings us together at last.

It's counter chat.

Counter chat.

Where do we even go from there?

Oh, well, apparently there's more counter chat in here.

Oh, I'm telling you.

I love this second.

You get one a show like this is not you guys need to just go start a

new show called counter chat because this is getting a little out of

hand.

All right, we can do the next one.

Come on.

I'm just just do a show just emphasizing the value of counter chat.

Move on.

Was it a good chat?

Let's do the next one.

Okay, the next one.

Also, I will point out that was not at a counter.

Where I've tried to pay for the haircut.

There's a counter.

I was paying.

I think he means it was a good chat at the chair and a shameful chat at

the counter.

He's left with a bad taste in his mouth.

Okay.

Shameful chat.

I love.

Okay.

All right.

You can do the other one since I was a shameful chat.

I'll be really quick.

I was at the pub.

Okay.

And somebody else another customer approached me and initiated a counter

chat with me asking about the beer I was drinking and was good and should

she also get a beer of that kind and she did.

She was like she was going to order something else.

She looked at it.

She's like, I'll get that one instead.

So I threw the power of counter chat initiated by her changed an order.

Crazy, huh?

Is just taking taking the world by storm.

You're really not convincing Jason of its value.

I think he's like,

That has happened since the beginning of time now has a brand.

I was at the counter.

I was at the bar.

What is more counter than a bar?

The gigantic counter is just such a loose term at this point counter used

to have a solid standing in the community.

We knew who they were now.

Everything's counter chat this segment brought to you by big counter.

Are you looking for granite granite countertops for your new kitchen?

You should try big counter.

If we did have ads, it would be so good to just have really dumb ones that

no one would ever use like no one would ever call a counter shop because

of us.

How's that awesome email program going?

Oh, you bring it up.

You bring it up the old favorite.

We're doing our is this our yearly check-in.

I think our yearly check-in on everyone's.

Not favorite big mail.

It's not out yet.

So we had big mail one.

It did not go well.

You were so excited about big mail one.

That's what makes me lie.

I don't think I've had been more excited about a piece of software.

Maybe ever then big mail one.

It was just it was going to be the best thing ever and all be all email thing.

So good it it came out.

It was rough and then it kind of just went away and then we got the announcement

of big mail to so you can imagine twice the number twice the excitement.

What what did they call it bigger mail?

Well, we're not sure why a lot of things are happening in that department right

now.

It's still in beta question mark.

I don't really know I completely lost sight of it for some reason it came up

recently.

I think I sent it to you.

Yeah, and then you and then you went on to thinking about other software that

was in the same realm of never happening or never being updated again.

And yeah, we're still 2024.

We're still waiting maybe 2025.

We'll see one thing is going to happen either big mail to is going to come

out or email will cease to exist.

One of those two things is going to happen before the other.

We just don't know what order they're going to come.

I feel like the misunderstanding with big mail to it's not the number.

It's big mail, to T double O.

It's just more.

Yeah, what you've come to love about more waiting.

Yeah, big mail as well as well.

Yeah.

What's the next counter chat?

Is there another one?

I'm done.

That's all the count yet.

Thanks for joining counter check.

I think what happened here is we had a basketball and then we had a basketball

and then we just got tired and we stopped putting it and then we woke up

again, like four items later to put a basketball.

I think that's what's going on here.

So we're going to assume these are all all basketballs and I wake up yesterday

morning and so this gigantic listen went well, I just wanted anything because

of how many countries have you listened to hemispheric views in no, there's

no question mark, but I will assume that it is an implied question mark.

And not a statement.

Yeah, okay.

Is that a question from for me or for Martin?

I didn't write or all listeners.

Oh, you didn't read it.

I didn't write this.

I didn't write it.

I didn't write it.

Maybe I write it.

You wrote this.

I think he did.

I think you're 100% right.

It must have come from the discord.

You wanted more context.

You gave yourself more context and that doesn't seem to be helping.

It's actually in here twice.

The same the same point is in the show notes twice in a row.

No, listen to know this.

There are two separate questions without question marks.

I added the second one as a follow-on question to the first one.

Ah, okay.

Okay.

Whoo.

Good system.

Bear with us everyone.

This is episode one.

We're still getting the kinks worked out.

It's we're going to get there eventually by episode like 118.

This thing is going to be just sailing.

Let me just have another sip of red wine over here.

I'll be a goon bag in the trash studios over there.

It's great.

You know what it is.

Goon bag wine.

I thought it might be.

Yeah, but that's a good goon bag.

It's the quality one.

So don't don't knock up my friend.

Sure.

Mm-hmm.

Would you like to answer your own question or how many countries are listening to this?

We're using I can answer that.

Is this perhaps a question for the audience?

I think it should be.

I think go to the discord.

And tell us show talk channel show talk.

I think my answer would probably be about three.

Wow.

What are they?

Far far more than I would have expected.

We'll be doing the show for a while.

I don't know.

It's a good question.

I maybe I'm do you regard other Australian states as countries has WA seceded?

Is that the idea?

Have I been away at any time since we've been recording this show?

Maybe not.

So you just threw three out there without any idea.

Do you regularly listen to this like outside of.

Oh, okay.

Do you not listen to it?

Do you not listen?

I mean, I have to listen to it to do the notes.

Yeah, but once it's in the free.

But no, why would I listen to it again?

I've already heard it three times two times by then.

That's the difference for Jason because he does the show notes.

He's listening to it to do it.

I do listen to it a bit afterwards because I'm curious to see what the product is like.

Once it's out there.

It's different from when you're editing it and particularly for you Andrew like you've edited it every alternating time.

As opposed to me.

So then I want to hear what yours sounds like.

Yeah, but Jason, I suppose is a bit different.

Yeah, I hear every single one after the edit like front to back in 1x speed as it was intended.

So I have no need to listen to it a second full time.

Wow.

Well, I hope you're downloading it still to reduce those numbers.

Oh, I'm downloading it on like 15 different podcast apps.

Of course.

Yeah.

Okay.

You've got like a scam wall with all those phones rigged up.

Yeah.

Yeah.

You know, like when they have the thing with like Pokemon go where they're running like 40 phones on that.

That's me with podcast apps.

Just download download VPN download download VPN download download.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm I got that angle covered.

Don't worry.

Well, I feel like my answer is the same for both of them.

I have only been since we started recording the show, actually, and since COVID and everything, I've only been overseas to New Zealand.

Yes, I think.

Yeah, that's all I can think of.

So, yes, I think I listened there to something and I think I recorded like a segment away from the studio there.

So it's like across the ditch.

That's it.

Yeah, I do recall that.

Yeah, I think it was about like a like a USB dongle or something.

I feel like or like some kind of travel.

Yeah.

And which maybe it was an HDMI.

Yeah, countdown and everything.

Oh, yes, that's right.

Okay.

And then I ended the whole thing very unintentionally sounding like I was doing something weird in a hotel room and I was back and I went that probably wasn't the way to express it on the podcast because I didn't mean it.

See what happens when you leave the country.

Everything just goes crazy.

Yeah.

Yep.

I've only ever recorded or listened, I think, here.

But soon, how many countries have you recorded and it will be three because the next I think it's the next episode.

I'm somewhere else.

And then a few episodes after that, I am somewhere else.

So I'll revisit this on episode one, one twenty four.

And I will say my answer is now three.

So there you go.

Cool.

Currently one will be three.

Escalated quickly.

I think I've only recorded in one country.

I think.

I don't think you've ever been anywhere else and recorded.

I think it's always been there.

Yeah.

You did go to Japan when you were checking on the lean manufacturing line for your Camry at the time.

I do.

That is true.

It's true.

You're walking down the line with your white gloves on and everything.

Guys.

You make a good point.

Um, slight segue lean manufacturing corner.

Oh, great.

Good job.

Thanks, Melvin.

Um, I sold the Camry.

Congratulations.

Well, yeah, good, but I don't have any more lean manufacturing in my life.

There's always going to be lean manufacturing in your life.

Something tells me and that by extension means it will always be in my life as well.

So you're welcome.

I don't think it's going anywhere.

It was a good car.

Good car.

Serve me well.

Well, now it's on to the next person to serve them well and hopefully fill their dinner table with many stories of lean manufacturing to their family, who I'm sure is so excited.

I left a leaflet in the glove box.

Do you mean so?

So nothing that came with the Toyota, something that you put in there about the benefits of lean manufacturing.

He, yeah, he printed out his own, his own PowerPoint deck and stuffed it in the glove compartment.

So I'm honestly not sure if this is a joke or not.

Well, people need to know, need to spread the good word.

It's like when you find a King James Bible in the hotel bedside table.

It's exactly like that.

Exactly the same.

Next topic.

I think we got time for what we're getting.

We're getting close.

I think we've got time for maybe one or two more things.

Let's see.

Do we have any?

Oh, it's a basketball.

Let's see.

I don't know.

I don't even know where to begin with this.

So I'm just going to, I'm going to pass the ball to you, Andrew, and you can take it away.

Look, it's a really Andrew heavy show.

And I apologize for that.

But I'm also very grateful for it because I'm now, you know, my slash guy page.

Yeah.

I've got another one.

It's exploding.

Frankly, I am now a gratitude.

I'm a gratitude guy.

Can you expand on that?

Yeah.

So I'm on this new app.

It's called like gratitude 365 and I gratefully just paid like $20 for a year's access for some reason.

And it gives me like AI generated prompts every day and then ask gives me a little spiel about, you know, something to think about.

And then ask me to think, think about how grateful I am about something.

And I write in the little box and then it generates using the power of chat GPTs based on what I've said.

A few little gratitude Nils for me to repeat back to myself.

And I do it.

So why are you paying for this?

I know it sounds like bullshit, right?

And it's like, and I thought it was bullshit, but I went with it.

And, you know, lo and behold, I'm finding myself a little bit more grateful for everyday things in life.

I was in the park the other day and I looked up at trees and I was like, wow, those trees are really pretty.

I feel a breeze blowing, herds of birds chirping.

And I was like, I'm really grateful for this moment.

And I would never have thought about that beforehand.

I like the irony that a machine told you or prompted you to feel grateful for that.

Martin, one person's bullshit is another person's counter chat.

Okay.

You just gotta let them have it.

I would just like to follow up here quickly looking at slash guy.

This is not on there.

So I don't know if technically you can claim it.

I didn't want to, I didn't want to jump in.

I didn't want people reading my slash page before I had a chance to officially announce it.

Understood.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

So I'll have it timed with the release of this podcast.

Now, have you guys ever tried, have you guys ever done gratitude journaling?

Because that's basically what this is.

I've often felt it without paying for it, if that's what you mean.

I'm going to, I have a question for Martin.

Is "gratitudinal", is that even a word?

Doesn't sound like a word.

I'm seeing a red dotted line under it in Arapel notes.

Shit, no, so I'm guessing not.

I feel like it's not.

It's just a lack of imagination.

Do you know what I think is hilarious?

What I found funny is that I didn't read the word ahead of the episode and the view that I have of it in my notes window right now has Andrew's face over it because that's where his cursor currently is.

So I've been living in suspense until we get there because I just say, I'm a "tudinal" guy.

I'm like, what the hell is the first syllable?

I'm a "gratitudinal" guy.

Gratitude, that's what it is.

Yeah.

There you go.

Oh, the cursor's skipping around.

I've moved it for you so you can see it.

In its glory.

I'm looking at the Slash Guy page as well now that I'm here.

I feel like we should talk about it a little bit.

Things are crossed out on the list now.

That's interesting.

They don't even get removed.

They just get strikethrough.

This list is really becoming something else.

Yeah, this is great.

If anyone has not seen the Slash Guy page, they should go.

candy.blog/guy.

Yeah, there's a lot going on over there.

There's audio clips.

It's like a Wikipedia page for what Slash Guy is.

It's pretty incredible.

Go check it out.

And just to finish off my "gratitudinal", I want to say a big "gratitudinal" thanks to a 1 Prime Plus member, friend of the show, member of the Discord, the whole bit, Zachary.

Oh my goodness, Zachary did me- he sent me a gift.

And I just want to say thank you, Zachary, for that gift of a keyboard, a Mac keyboard, the Magic Keyboard with the Touch ID sensor on it.

Oh.

And a Sushi Mouse.

That's generous.

I know.

A Sushi Mouse.

Can you believe that?

And it's a new Sushi Mouse.

The only Sushi Mouse I ever had was the one we had to put AA batteries in the bottom of it.

This is the spearfishing one.

Spearfishing?

You mean the one where you turn it on its back like a turtle?

Into its guts.

Oh, OK.

Gotcha.

So Zachary-

Are you using that mouse?

Well, not yet.

I wasn't- that was like- I think he threw that in as a bonus.

I didn't really- I didn't express-

I'm so grateful I haven't used it.

But the Touch ID- now I've got an external keyboard with a Touch ID sensor.

The only problem is because, like, my house is in a bit of a state of disrepair at the moment.

I don't have a computer to actually join it up to.

But that will happen, Zachary.

Promise you.

Someday.

And that is Gratitudinal for August 30th.

Whew.

Man, this has been like a whirlwind.

It's like therapy session for me, this one.

I cannot believe that there's a robot.

I know.

You never thought it would come, right?

You thought, boy, we are just- we are just balls deep right now in Andrew Topics.

Those are the words.

Yeah.

And we're just never going to get out.

Yeah, but now I'm looking at this topic and I'm like, what the hell is this?

This topic comes to us from inside the house.

Terminology, we talk about a lot in terms of differences, quirkiness.

Ha ha ha.

Why would you say it that way?

Well, have either of you ever come across the term horse sipping?

Never.

No.

Let me paint you a picture.

And as I'm painting this picture, think in your mind, oh, we call that, and then just blurt it out.

OK, that's the game.

Oh, like, first thing that comes to our mind, is that what you mean?

Yep.

Like, for you both, where you're at in your locale, what would you- you saw me doing this,

you'd be like, what the- you're doing X, OK?

OK, here we go.

We're in the kitchen on lovely big counter countertops.

See how I threw that in there?

Yeah.

Very good.

Native advertising.

Grab a glass.

Got a glass.

Yeah, that was not dynamically inserted.

That was just flow.

That's professional.

OK, I grab a glass out of the cabinet, put it on the countertop, granite, dark granite countertop from big counter.

I grab, I don't know, something out of the fridge to drink.

I pour it into the cup, and I'm pouring it, and I'm pouring it.

You're both getting very nervous.

It's getting towards the top.

I'm pouring.

I'm still pouring.

You're like, why is he still pouring?

It's very full.

Still pouring.

All the way to the top, so you get that nice little bubble on the top of the glass.

Aniscus.

Right?

And you're like, oh, wow, how's he going to lift that up and carry that to the living room now without, sorry, lounge room, without spilling it on the new wood floors from big floor?

How's he going to do it?

So I lean towards the cup, and I slowly sip out a little bit without moving the cup to get it down to an acceptable level for travel.

What are we calling that action in your neck of the woods?

Honestly, I never even thought of a word for that action.

I just would have thought of it as.

But you've done it.

You've done it, surely.

Yeah.

Many times.

Because you want it to the edge.

Yeah.

Okay.

But you don't have like a term for it.

I just call it slurping.

But that's just a word.

It's not really a term.

Okay.

Because this happened, this exact picture that I just painted for you is hanging on the wall in my home because that is where it happened.

I did this.

I filled up a cup all the way.

Too full.

What are you doing?

Did the motion and heard something to the effect of, oh, you're horse sipping.

I was like, what?

What?

I've not heard this term before.

And this is I've done this surely many times.

This is the first time the term had come up.

And I was like, wow, I've never heard that.

I need to bring this directly to the equator and spread it around the world.

So I'm curious.

My hunch is that this is an East Coast US thing versus West Coast.

That's my hunch.

But I am curious to hear from the dedicated hemispherians.

Is this a term you are aware of?

If so, where are you located?

Or alternatively, what do you call this motion that I'm pretty sure is like worldwide?

Like everybody has to be doing this, right?

There's no country in which people are not filling to the max and then having to do that kind of recovery move.

So I want to know.

Unless they live in a desert or something.

I assume that's true.

Which case there'd be very little water to.

Yeah.

Although I am interested in the choice of the word horse.

Because if I imagine like a slightly overfilled or like right to the top kind of vessel of liquid.

A horse inserting its mouth into that is not what I would consider to be a careful or elegant solution.

It's just spluttering everyone making a mess.

So which horse was it that was so careful when dealing with the meniscus?

Maybe it's a really fancy horse.

I got this big lips.

I show you our home. It could be like a horse that went to like finishing school and is just like very proper and refined to the elocution lessons and stuff.

Like you go hang and win.

Hello.

Hello horse.

Like where does the small fork go and they point to the correct spot next to the plate and you're like, oh, okay.

Yeah, they understand.

Yeah.

Okay, there you go.

That was it.

That's my whole thing.

So yeah, that's that.

And please listen to this.

Tell us in the discord or mastodon micro blog wherever I want to know.

I'm curious.

I genuinely want to know.

I want to know a do you do that?

Is that like a regular thing?

I need to know if this is like a global thing.

And if so, what is the name of it that you would call that action?

And also if you want to put that in like a native language, that would be great too.

Because sometimes that's fun when there's, you know, we call it whatever.

Yeah, so let us know.

These are the things people want to know.

That reminds me, um, little joke.

Horse, horse walks into a bar and slides up to big counter and bartender says, why the long face?

Horse says, nice counter chat.

Hey.

That's a three, two, one.

That's it.

That's how I want the show to end.

I want that to be the end.

I want that joke to be the outro to this.

It's so good.

No, I was going to let you bring some tech adjacent adjacency back to the show with your PSA.

No, that's fine.

No, we're ending flat on the horse joke.
