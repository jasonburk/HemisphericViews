The sun's out guys summer has well and truly returned here and the birds are out so apologies in advance.
Babs that's all good as long as there's that a little bit of whippersnap and maybe a few cars and toilet guy.
How into a guy yeah we have an art it's twenty twenty three the whole new toilet guy new new year new toilet guy have you still got Tim cook living next year.
No, Tim and Tamina moved on and there's a couple there who I don't know if they actually go through their door because I've just been seeing like packages.
Piling up at their front door but there has been car activity so it's like the holidays were not bothering to actually pick up any postage.
Will just step over it.
I'm sad to hear that Tim cooks moved on.
Yeah it is pretty sad because every morning you would just look out the window and to me it would be preparing breakfast and he would just be gratefully accepting it with his prayer hands it was very beautiful.
That's nice I mean it was probably just there there was some logistics thing going on temporary housing kind of a thing so glad they got that sorted.
Will and don't close to the supply chain in China so he's probably just here during that real crisis time.
Yeah with that could supply chain back in order and now we can head back to a cup of tea now.
I would like to start with a story can can I will you indulge me.
I'm a very indulgent man go for it.
As the flames consumed everything in its path it seemed like all was lost but just then.
A glimmer of light appeared on the horizon.
It was One Prime Plus, rising from the ashes like a phoenix, its brilliant flame illuminating
the darkness.
The people rejoiced as the light chased away the shadows and brought new life to the land.
One Prime Plus had risen, and with it came new hope and a bright future.
Wow.
You wrote this?
That's beautiful.
Welcome to 2023, everybody. One Prime Plus is back!
Did One Prime Plus die?
Yeah, what happened to it?
It did. It died a very horrible death, but it is back. It has been brought back from
the dead. Mostly. If you're hearing this and you were previously a One Prime Plus subscriber,
You sort of aren't anymore, but you are.
So yeah, I'll give the short version.
We migrated from one platform to another in basically a seamless fashion, I would say.
And by seamless, we lost all of the subscribers and they are now forced to sign up again somewhere
else.
Really, you know, no work on their part is required other than signing up again if they
really, really want to.
And we'd be very appreciative if they did.
And new subscribers as well.
So if you're looking for some hot OnePrimePlus action, you can still go to where?
OnePrimePlus.com.
That's the beauty of the URL is it doesn't matter.
It always goes to the right place.
So 2023 is going to be a big year for 1primeplus.com.
So all those people who are paying money on Patreon are now not, am I allowed to say that
word?
Are now not paying money to Patreon.
Patreon is no longer taking their money.
That is correct.
That is correct.
Yes, we are at a net and gross revenue of zero.
So you're welcome for that.
But that being said, we came back from zero pretty quick, right out of the gate.
Little Hey Scotty Jay came in and said, "You know what?
I want to be Northern Hemisphere.
That's what I want to be.
That's what I want from my life in 2023."
So thank you, Scotty, for that genuine and generous boost to our new year.
And look, I think it's probably fair at this point, because I know you've been pretty brief,
for Jason and thank you for that. Do you want to just maybe say very quickly why we were undergoing
this change? Because you put a lot of effort into it and it was, you know, quite well considered.
We did discuss this for a long time. It wasn't a knee-jerk change. So what did you see as the
benefit of the move other than it breaking everything? Yeah, well, the main benefit was
that it did break everything and caused a lot of pain and suffering for everyone. So we got that
checkbox there. Good job us. But the main thing was that we wanted to move to a platform that
I think was more aligned with what we were trying to do from a podcasting perspective
and less from everything else that was going on over there. So for the end user, it should
hopefully now be a better experience, both from signing up and having your new feed and
the way that we can interact with everybody. It's just a nicer, more simplistic, prettier
experience for the world of podcasting, since that's really what we're doing here.
That's good. And one prime plussians and hemispherians who are thinking about becoming
one prime plussians, we're always kind of thinking about how we can improve or rejig one prime plus.
And this year we're thinking we might do the newsletters a little bit differently. There
might be some video thrown in. We want to give you value, but we also don't want to be super
regular and annoying because the last thing you want for one of those very small, you know,
infinitesimal fees is to be annoyed constantly by emails and updates. So, you know, you'll get
stuff, but not too annoyingly. Yeah. And if you have ideas, let us know. That's what it's for.
And I've just got some live, a live update on our performance on the new platform. And Martin,
it's a little bit, a little concerning from our perspective.
Why is that? It does this handy geographic distribution map.
I can see where people are coming from.
And you know it likes that early days on the new platforms we encourage everybody to resign up if they if they wish.
Especially Southern Hemisphere now you may remember if you go back to the early days one prime plus.
In its first incarnation Southern Hemisphere was strong out of the gate Martin you probably remember that we had we had the lead for a long time yeah.
Blitzing.
Current stats not looking so good.
We've got got one on got one.
But you know what I say in this Andrew I see an unbelievable positive in the fact that this is like an.
This is like an unexpected long burning business corner segment right it's a case study about how not to do business right so first of all we did.
Two consecutive months of refunds. We gave people their money back. And you know what? That is an example of trying to foster customer satisfaction among our hemispherians, our one prime plus subscribers. And then what did we do? We actually said, you know what? You don't have to pay us anything anymore. Get off the system. Who cares? Just go away.
And then we said come back so look I reckon this is business corner at its finest and Andrew I want to thank you for bringing us.
Transitioning us to that little point.
It's interesting so these people now gone three months without one prime plus in their lives.
And their lives are taking along just lovely just for just fine and the thing why do I need this in my life well let me tell you do you do need it in your life.
How else do you know what hemisphere you're in if you're not a subscriber? That's what I want to know.
It's true. It's true.
Good point. It's a good point.
And the best part was they actually got everything in OnePrime+ during those three months. So,
it's a win-win for everyone but us.
But jokes aside, jokes aside, thank you Jason for toiling through this. I was kind of on holiday
and semi-unaware of the breakage as it happened. Andrew was probably more attentive than I was.
I was following along but i was entirely confused it's working out actually no it's not working down as was everyone else don't worry i promise we're gonna shut up about this now but i did remember one other key benefit is that the tears have been updated.
So that there is now there still the northern there's still the southern there still the global but there is now also with the ability with this to do one time payment so it's not a recurring subscription.
So there is a walking the line one for seven.
It's just a once.
And then there's also a yearly give me everything for 75.
And you can always just do a donation of any amount regardless.
So if you just say, hey, I want to chuck you guys a couple bucks.
You can do that too.
So done talking about that now.
Yep.
Beep boop bop boop beep.
Next.
Speaking of holiday projects, Jason, you've Jason, you've recently bought
keyboards, been hurt by keyboards, moved to another keyboard, and now you've been tearing
apart keyboards.
Are you okay?
I am.
Yeah, I actually think I am in a good place from a keyboard perspective now.
So I still have my keyboard that I love, my Keychron Q1 something or other.
I think there's more things after that, but whatever.
You know what all third-party keyboards lack?
Touch ID.
It's really hard to not have touch ID.
You could type in your password, I suppose.
Sure.
- Like a pleb.
- You could use your watch if you got an Apple watch.
That's a good alternative.
You know, the little double tap on the side.
That's pretty decent.
- Sorry, unless you have an Intel iMac
that the latest software update
kind of doesn't seem to unlock,
the watch unlock thing.
- Okay.
- That seems less than ideal.
- Next segment is Mac purchase corner.
We're gonna get Andrew and you can do it.
- Yeah. - Go on Jason.
- I have thoughts.
It's actually a good one.
I have thoughts.
Put a pin in it.
- Pin, it's been pinned.
Touch ID is just one of those things
that's fantastic on the Mac.
And I didn't have one.
I had a keyboard sitting off to the side,
like a weirdo who was just kind of hanging out
that I would use as touch ID,
but it was like, that's not enough.
So it was time to take a perfectly good,
functional working keyboard
And rip it apart because you know, obviously
so that's what I did and I won't go through all of the
Whole thing right now
I did there's two blog posts about it one sort of about how to rip it apart and then the second one is more about
What the heck to do with it after that?
But long story short, I ripped it out. It all functioned
I've got a working
standalone Touch ID button on my desk now that I can use alongside whatever else and it is glorious.
I will say it is not probably for the faint of heart. I don't think this is a
level one anybody go ahead and try it type of exercise,
but at the same time
it's not too difficult
if you have a little bit of experience with kind of taking stuff apart at a smaller-ish size. So
I'll put the blog post in the show notes, of course,
so you can check it out.
If you want to do this, I'm happy to answer questions.
I take no responsibility for any broken keyboards
that you happen to break in going through this process.
But I have to say, I'm just so incredibly thrilled
to have Touch ID back on my desk,
alongside any other peripheral that I want to use.
It is awesome.
- Is this something that you would do again,
like ripping apart technology like this?
- Oh, absolutely, yes.
if there were like another,
if there were like a face ID thing
embedded in something that I could rip out
and shove on top of another thing,
I would definitely do it.
Absolutely.
- I found it mildly terrifying,
but I really loved your photo updates.
And as I scrolled through, I went,
"Oh, okay, he's getting started.
"Oh, that looks serious.
"What the hell is that?"
And it was just this,
I don't know, it just made me feel uncomfortable.
I'm glad that you had the confidence to do it,
but I just know that I'd be worried
about getting hair stuck in there or tripping something or breaking it or tweezers snapping.
No, no thanks.
I'm getting the same vibe from you, Andrew.
Yeah.
Yeah, I would never have the confidence.
There are many steps.
There are many steps in which it could have gone south very quickly, and fortunately it did not.
The thing I liked in your very, I think it was your opening photo, and I think you had a spudger, and I was very excited to see that you had a spudger, and also that I
recognized what a spudger was and then that was the end of my hardware expertise.
Oh yeah, it's a spudger. Nothing else makes sense here.
Perfect. It's really not that bad, but also that being said, I would not sign up to just do this
a bunch of times for other people. This is not a business I would want to get into, so I'll just
cut that off right there. Oh, that was going to be the one. That was the one prime plus bonus this
month. Everybody gets a touch ID button. That would be amazing. But unfortunately, no.
One final question before we move on with all of the bits from the keyboard that you pulled apart,
have you constructed or are you planning on constructing some form of wall decoration to
go into a study made out of those parts? Oh, yeah, it's already in the works for sure. Yep.
You are absolutely spot on. You're not joking? No, not at all.
Okay, well, there you go. Yeah, that will be the next blog post, probably.
What to do with the rest of the crap that you don't use.
Do you have some option keys lying around? They would look lovely hanging over your toilet,
as a little chandelier. All right, what's next?
I'm just waiting a moment. I'm just waiting a moment because toilet man flushed upstairs.
Oh, toilet guy!
[Music]
So I thought we'd have just a very quick photography corner and it's actually very little about
photography and more about how daggy I've become.
Oh!
I don't know if you guys can see that in the notes but I mentioned that we are-
You probably need a translation there though, I would imagine.
Daggy. Right, so daggy is a colloquial term in Australia that means that you're kind of
dorky or maybe dishevelled or lazy in the way that you dress or act and it comes from
The original cloak will term dag which is the name of a hanging piece of shit from a lamb's are stuck in its wool
Okay, perfect, and if you're a bit daggy, it's a bit. Yeah, just tasteful. You're a bit of a dag painting a beautiful picture
Please go on I'm pressed or maybe I'm surprised that you're saying that you've become daggy now
I'm sorry that everybody else's address this low-key call-out here, but all right
(laughing)
- Okay, just imagine everything that I just said,
but with dag-ear, all right?
As a modification.
Yeah, we went down the coast for a couple of days
to a family member's holiday house
at a place called Sussex Inlet.
It's basically like a man-made water course.
So it's like a river that actually flows
through the back of suburbs.
Anyway, lovely area walking around, kind of small town.
And at the back of all of these houses,
there are these little jetties or wharves.
So people can take their boats or jet skis
or just go for a swim.
And it was perfect to take Mac for a swim
because it's kind of a cross between a swimming pool,
a beach with sand and a really calm river.
So young kids can just kind of frolic around.
And eventually he had his kind of afternoon nap
and Natasha was off doing something else.
And I thought, what better opportunity to get out
and shoot some birds with a camera, not a gun, don't worry.
because I went out and got a new 100 to 400 millimeter
Olympus lens.
So like long range, long reach for wildlife or whatever.
Bit of an early present family chipped in.
Thank you very much.
So early birthday present that is.
So I thought I'll go out the back, take some photos.
And I was spotting ducks and cockatoos
and all these things around the place.
And it was right after I'd been for a swim.
And to clarify with you, I've long worn board shorts, right?
Sure.
Commonplace. It's the less daggy thing to do.
But I kind of get a bit annoyed about it because you're basically wearing clothes in the water.
It kind of defeats the purpose of swimming.
And I already have hairy enough arms and legs that sunscreen becomes an issue.
And then you kind of got these shorts clinging to these hairy legs.
Sorry for the image, everyone.
But you get what I'm-
Image in the show notes.
I'm also hairy.
So I'm right there with you, Martin.
I'm understanding. - Exactly.
And you know, you kind of get to this age where it's like, I'm not that old, but it's like, you know what, whatever.
I'm just going to go in Speedos or Budgie Smugglers for the less branded kind of vibe.
Yeah. Love it.
And I really leaned into it and got these ones from this cafe called the Rusty Rabbit that they sell them in Sydney.
It's kind of like got breakfast pattern on it.
So you got like a fried egg and bacon and avocado and all the stuff.
So it's full on daggy.
I'm not going to include photos in the show notes because that might break the internet.
But anyway, I'm out the back and other family were coming along to join us for the trip, but we got there first.
And I'm out the back shooting, right?
And suddenly I get this tap on my watch and it's a message to the family group from Natasha saying,
"Just a warning, family. Someone has called the police on Martin because he's using his new long lens to take photos while wearing his Speedos."
Yeah.
Oh, yes.
Anyway, I can assure you I was taking photos of birds, not through people's suburban windows,
but you know what? This was just- It was like a revelation. As Andrew said, daggy. I've now
reached the daggy heights that it's like, you know what? I'm just going to go out on the jetty,
wildlife photography in Speedos. If anyone had looked through the window, they would have gone,
"Who the hell is this gentleman with only his undies on taking photos of birds outside with this
thing the size of, I don't know, two Pringles tubes?"
Yeah, they weren't saying "gentleman." I can tell you that right now.
Who is this beast who is emerged from the shrubbery.
I just want to add Martin it's okay because I joined the budgie smuggler brigade last summer.
Wow.
Okay I spent a lifetime doing the board short thing.
And I suddenly I suddenly thought why am I doing this to myself especially now that I have a swimming pool in my yard why would I do.
40th it just ridiculous so I went the budget smuggler and my I got budget smuggler the I got the actual budget smuggler brand.
Wait that's that's actually the brand name.
What the it's it's a colloquialism and the brand has piggybacked on to that colloquial.
Okay so there pick their taking that mine might be too actually.
Yeah and my print is a bubble of your last cream is melting.
I love that you've gone for just another completely Australian kind of print I've gone for breaking you've gone for bubble oh bill that's great it's an ice cream is there a centred right on the front.
That's all I think there is actually yeah.
I need to like look through the rack to find the one that had the print in the correct orientation that you.
I like bill was a shaped ice cream and sort of a car down and look like a look like a Texan.
Big cowboy hat big chubby cheeks and his nose was a big.
Ball of rock hard it was started rock hard and then you chew it and it would become bubble gum hence bubble oh bill apparently now they've released it but I don't think that I know is it no longer chewing gum because it's like a safety hazard or something.
And it's not as good. Okay, but the original bill was great. These are like the
you would get them from like, we have I think something similar. I think you're talking about
where it's like a character ice cream. And the nose or the eyes are gumballs. Yes, yes. And the
picture of it is like, oh, it's a ninja turtle. And you're like, oh, this is gonna be so cool.
And then you open it and it looks like a freaking nightmare because it's all just like melted and
And you just want to like throw it and run is that the same.
That is.
That's okay.
If you're a Bob's burgers fan it's like when the Gucci Kobe doll melts.
I don't know if you know I'm talking about Louisa's toy Bob's burgers reference for listeners out there.
Okay, it's like that.
So anyway that that print is on my budgie smugglers budgie smugglers are wonderful to swim in.
I commend them to everybody.
See on my future vacation over there just is looking so much brighter now. I can't wait
Well, you're gonna be next to the hairy beast from New South Wales and the guy with the rock-hard ball and his budgie smugglers
Yeah, mr. Australia. That's what you said. Yeah. Yeah and and the 400 millimeter lens and that's what I'm gonna be associated with
Better coming with all I look forward to spending a night in jail with both of you. This is gonna be great
Anyway that is photography corner did you at least get some good photos that we can post not of you in a speedo is that.
Yeah there a couple of duck photos and stuff on my glass account and I was actually just out of the Botanic Garden before this recording chasing some.
Birds and stuff there so.
Hold on hold on that's not the Australian eyes chasing some birds with my camera.
Oh yeah I'm avian creatures thank you not women.
Thank you.
Oh right ok good clarification.
Thank you for Australia just down the road chasing some birds that's it.
I don't want to get more trouble.
Thank you Andrew for saving me.
Does anybody actually say birds anymore for women though I don't think I never have I never have it's just an old man kind of thing but I figure I'm reaching old man territory so I have to be careful.
It's just like apparently one of the most Australian words you can say is drongo but I've never once called someone that seriously.
I don't think I've heard that one.
You galah?
It's just like fool or idiot or yeah yeah you galah. Yeah there's another one I'm like when I say galah I'm talking about the bird and the avian creature.
Oh man this is getting, this is layers now wow.
I think we need a, I think we need a transition.
Well something is blown up and Andrews added to the notes but blown up in the good sense not in the earlier one prime plus sense is that right Andrew.
Yes this is in like the the Millennials like millennials all mad blown up.
So we did like bad business corner we did that that was us.
Then now we're transitioning to like good business corner right.
Yeah, okay, so if we reflect on the fact that our own business corner we reduced our prices to zero to zero and then got rid of all our customers.
Yeah, I didn't actually paid paid basically paid them.
Yes, the customer yeah like reverse okay our friend our friend Adam at me yes.
Yes, there is discord channels and sometime guest of the show at OMG to lol.
Good friend his he's a good business corner because he put up he put his prices up at the beginning of this year.
He got a lot of war that sounds risky.
I know you would think so but he's in gendered good support and people have liked him for appreciated the value that they received any get their warning you'd stock up on it the cheap price really good.
Then he put his prices up and then all of a sudden he became super super popular and had a whole bunch of new subscribers.
Like how can happen to a nicer guy genius business corner so he got mentioned on hacker news which is why combinator dot something.
Yeah they have a couple of use I think a month probably yeah yeah seven it's full of it's a it's a weird website it's kind of like angry techno dreaded in a way.
I'm but yeah he got right up there and it's led to a bunch of people at least trying out his product and then.
Even more relevant to make is a bit of RSS feed subscriber of waxy waxy.org.
His link list it hit that link list OMG to lol mention there so I friend Adam I think I think it's good is working out for him dealing with the.
Hundreds of new subscribers that he's brought onto the platform but well done to him.
Hit Merlin man today as well so now he's really good.
Wow sorry I just wanna say as well as good as I like to say chemistry reviews trendsetter.
Always.
Yeah, that's clearly, that was obvious, the obvious trajection, trajectory, that was going
to happen as soon as, I mean, it's, it's neat vember.
Yeah.
Right?
I mean, that's the neat vember bump is what they call that.
You have neat vember and then four or five unknown amount of time, months later, blows
up.
It's guaranteed.
It's yeah, it's done deal.
So honestly though, huge congrats.
I'm super thrilled that it's getting the,
getting the appreciation and number of users
that it deserves 'cause it's a great service.
- And for him to get all this after his price has gone up,
wow, we could learn so much.
Just amazing.
Martin, you're just looking a bit dumbfounded
through this little talk.
Are you okay?
You have any thoughts?
I'm just flabbergasted at the success, frankly.
And yeah, no negatives.
And look, I was also thinking about how we're all
like enthusiastic OMG.LOL users, aren't we?
And you're all using the weblog as well
that he's been transitioning to beta now.
- I tested it and then I realized that I didn't have time
for another weblog in my life.
And I should just stick with what I know at micro.blog.
But I think Jason has a different story.
My entire life is in omg.aol.
All of it, I'm all in, 100%.
Yeah, if it goes down,
I don't exist on the internet anymore.
- So I went between the two of you, the middle route,
not ignoring it, not going all in,
but making a daily, here's a thought in German blog
for no apparent reason, but thank you, Adam.
- Which is so cool, I think that's so awesome.
What I really want now, so I'll just go ahead and say it,
'cause you'll hear this and then immediately have to do it,
is I would love a little auto translator thing
so that you could see your blog in different languages.
I think that would be fun.
- This new German one?
- Yeah.
- Doesn't Safari do that though?
Or can't you get like?
- Oh, there's 50 million different ways to do it.
But if I, you know, then I gotta go do something.
So if it's just built in.
- What's the URL for your German thing?
I haven't given it a unique domain or anything. It's just martinfeld, you know, all one word
dot weblog dot lol. I trialed doing a couple before the end of the year and then I thought,
"Do I want to do this?" And then I just added one and I'm going to try to get in the habit of doing
one thought per day, which could be completely mundane, not even interesting, but I went,
"Ah, it's a good way to keep up the skill." And is it hard for you right now? Or have you
already been sort of doing it anyway with other stuff? So you're still like in the
habit of writing in German. I used to be much better than I was because I was actually working
with Germans. I did exchange. I went over there and stuff. So it was a thing, but it's been in
like true maintenance mode because when you're not surrounded by them every day and not using it,
yeah, reading and listening skills, passive stuff that stays with you much more easily, but
writing and speaking the active stuff, that's more difficult. I actually cracked out. And I think this
this is the last thing that I put up there,
at least at the time of this recording,
a little thing about pulling out a 1000 words
in German kids vocab book
and reading it to Mac every so often.
He's obsessed with the hippo pictures in that thing.
- Don't spoil it too much Martin,
because I've just loaded this webpage in Arc.
It's, I've got it here in front of me
and it's also prompted me,
would I like to translate this page to English?
So Jason feature request done.
- There you go.
- I'm just wondering, Martin,
Would you like me to read this to you in German with my.
Oh so reading just what I wrote.
Yes.
Yes.
I would love that.
Go for it.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's see if I can do this and I am not a German speaker or reader.
1000 Deutschworte.
(speaking in German)
(laughing)
- It sounded perfect.
The ha ha ha lol at the end that was not there it was an emoji it's a smiling emoji of course but the way that you read it out is classic.
Okay now I should translate it with arc translate translating okay 1000 German words.
Today I started reading a 1000 word book with Mac to teach him the German language he loves it especially the hippo side crying emoji.
Now can I can you start reading that German book to me please because I think I need some help.
It sounded good it sounded really good I have to say I mean the inflections you had sounded really good.
Thanks if it's any consolation and this is how and I don't say this to have a dig at Germans because I love them they're great people but they're very very forthright and direct even though I studied it kind of.
Inconsistently on and off for years you never native speaker and you always end up sending a bit strange and I remember people I worked with telling me.
You sound kind of cutesy kind of like a child would speak.
So even if I were to read it to you yeah okay with sound more German but Germans listening probably go Martin is troubled.
Okay can you read it first then.
How I would read it yes please and thousand do it up what the happy is on the phone and I'm thousand with a book with my to listen to him the deutschsprache by to bring in a leap this because on this design to meet them near failed.
Little childish but pretty good.
He left at the end.
Yeah I didn't.
L O L.
There is the child.
Ha ha ha I will leave that to listeners decide who is the better German speaker.
And that is a new segment called the Deutsche Ecke which translates to.
German corner.
Thank you German corner very good.
Actually close it out with your new computer that you bought Andrew.
Well yeah so.
My I've let me start again you're doing better with the German.
I don't need a computer take two I don't need a new computer I have plenty of computers I have three I have three.
The problem I've got is I don't have a decent monitor the only monitor I've got is this iMac which is why the iMac continues to exist.
because 27 inches of beautiful screen with an Intel chip inside.
I think they call that Intel inside.
They should put a sticker on it to help me with that.
I wish they would. How else could you know? I'm amazed you remembered.
I know. So if I could just get a monitor, a nice 5k 27 inch monitor,
that I could then connect to my MacBook Air or connect to my Mac Mini, I'd be in pretty good
place. And this iMac could be handed down, moved on, what have you. To future generations.
Exactly. With its 40 gigabytes of memory, they'd love it. I have been looking at the Apple display
and continually thinking, it's just expensive. Fellas, you've seen the news from Samsung,
all right? No. Samsung are releasing a new monitor and in true Samsung
style it looks identical to a studio display. I'm sure that's a coincidence.
But it has an actual webcam popping up the top. Right a little so like it but it
looks the same I don't know if it's apparently probably gonna use the same
panel I don't know what the speakers will be like but I don't really care
about that. Plus bonus it's Samsung so it's probably listening to everything you're doing
so you got that going for you. But it'll be cheaper. Well yeah because you're yeah you know
forget anything else that's cheaper good point. So can I interest you in a 6k panel from Dell?
No no I draw the line at Dell sorry. But it's it it has a physical button for Microsoft Teams on it.
Wow.
Is that true?
It's 100% true.
I saw this Dell monitor, and I was like, ooh,
that's actually a nice-looking 6K panel.
Like, that's pretty decent.
And then I see there's physical buttons on it.
One of them is Microsoft Teams.
It's a built-in Stream Deck.
What are you complaining about?
That's genius.
It's like when you get the TV that
has the remote with the streaming service buttons on it,
and it's like, that's not even a service anymore.
Okay crunchy granola buttons stuck on my remote control so yeah guys I am getting it well it's not available yet and they haven't announced pricing because it's a CES thing who knows if they'll even actually make it is 27 inch 5k so it's it's identical.
Okay if it's significantly cheaper.
I would be tempted.
I just don't know what so what problem is it solving watch ID.
Get rid of the iMac and be able to use it. I can't log in with my watch.
I just for whatever reason the latest version of Mac OS has bugs in it and it doesn't work.
So your main computer would be your MacBook Air then basically is what you're saying. I could be my MacBook Air or the Mac Mini.
I forgot about that okay and if I had to input sources about even better.
Yeah I don't know so look I'm not gonna I'm not rushing not rushing into anything but I'm just starting to think the iMac is now coming up on what three years old or something four years old.
It's like seven years old something ancient about this Mac 2019.
So fairly recent. Yeah well yeah. So it does seem it seems like it could be still have another life
just not a life with me. So yeah there we go. Let me know what I should do people.
Well on the plus side it'll work great with your Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra Plus S.
Does anyone think those camera lenses look like spider eyes? They freak me out. I don't like it.
I don't think I've seen it. The back with all the circles it's reminding me more and more of
of a spider's face, more and more reason not to buy one.
Don't like it.
- Thanks for putting that in my head.
- Sorry, slight digression.
Do you like your iMac?
- I like it.
It still does everything I need it to do, right?
Sometimes it's a little bit, it's a slow,
it's hell slow to log in.
Like if you boot this up from cold start,
it's like eight minutes of waiting
for it to get everything sorted and ready to go.
- Right, okay.
- And is it important to you to have an all-in-one computer?
- It's a convenience, but it's mainly the screen.
I just like the big screen.
- Okay.
Do you have any issue with constantly unplugging
and plugging in laptops, like the MacBook Air, to a display?
Is that an issue?
- I remember that got annoying back when I used to do that
with my old MacBook.
- Right.
And what does the Mac mini do at the moment?
- It sits in a cupboard running Plex.
- And is that crucial to your life?
or could you surrender that to make it the new center
of everything?
- Well, I think I could probably surrender it
and make it the center,
but it's only got eight gigabyte of RAM
'cause I went cheap on that.
- Oh, nope, don't do that.
I'm gonna veto that right now.
- Oh, really?
- Mm-mm.
- I agree.
I moved to 16 for this Mac mini, the 2020 M1 version,
and it's way better.
I would not go back to eight, at least for what I'm doing.
I've had one experience with the eight and it was not good.
Yeah, because I bought it so specifically to be like a little server that I just went.
Now that that's that is going to be its job going forward.
My air has 16.
I have a recommendation.
I think you're considering a computer purchase at the wrong time of year.
Right. So we had all this exciting stuff last year.
They're still going to release new M2 kind of fueled things later this year.
you have three computers that are totally fine, right?
And will last you.
The only thing that's really annoying you is your ability
or rather inability to unlock this thing
with a watch or your fingerprint.
So why not just wait till some new computer
with a new processor or version comes out,
whether it's a newer iMac or a MacBook Pro
or whatever it is,
or you do take the plunge and get the studio display,
just give it a few months
So you actually have something 2023 based to purchase.
- Martin is the worst.
- He's so wise.
- God, he's just like, no, do the responsible thing.
- Does Jason want to say buy all the things immediately?
(laughing)
- No, I'm just waiting on the, I want the end.
I would actually wait as well, to be perfectly honest.
I don't think I would, I would not buy anything right now.
- Okay, not even a Samsung display.
- I would never buy anything Samsung branded ever in my life.
Okay, all right
Is this what you wanted to hear Andrew you just wanted?
This seems like this was super helpful. I was hoping for some small level of enabling but no it's okay
You are since you are right. I would wait. I would I would a hundred percent wait, you know
You should do that
You should buy the iMac that has not been updated since 2020 a great computer though
It is and then by the Samsung display to go in the center and push the iMac to the side
You should buy my iMac that's what you should buy I
I don't want your price I don't want your iMac with a broken keyboard.
Give you a keyboard with no touch ID sensor.
It's got the wrong power plug on it I don't want it.
We'll check back in we'll check in in a little while yeah once we hear some more things and we'll get you will you set up in the meantime it'd be great if Apple could just stop releasing new operating systems with additional bugs.
That too much to ask actually I know Andrew you should just go iPad only that is the most uncontroversial thing on the internet in the Mac community.
Oh yeah I've heard you can get real work done.
Yeah with them I've even forgotten the name of the side show what is it side stage.
Center stage manager.
Yeah it's hopeless I don't use that.
I like it when I can get angry at Apple. It's a good feeling.
Oh so you have four computers then really, because you got your iPad too.
Oh yeah. There you go.
You're using Tot, Andrew, right?
Tot, yes.
Yeah well Tot's on the Apple Watch now. There's all your blogging and note-taking needs done. You just live with a watch.
I forgot it was on the Apple Watch.
I love it. It's great.
That's where I do all my blogging from. Just from my watch.
Well it's funny, I've unsubscribed from drafts again. It's not on my watch.
Just create a shortcut with at least 75 steps that somehow gets an Apple Watch top note into your blog and you'll be set.
I know a guy that does a lot of shortcut stuff. I'll put you in touch.
He knows who he is. How do I get a top on my watch?
Watch. Sorry, this is devolved into Andrew install software.
I think that means we're done. I'm pretty sure when you start installing software on your watch, I think that's where we call it.
I believe Martin's line can't stand I know no, it's not here. There's no time. Here we go counting down in
three
