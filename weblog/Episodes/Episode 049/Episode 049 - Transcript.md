Hi, I'm Andrew.
And I'm Jason.
And I'm Martin.
This is Hemispheric Views.
Yeah, so what listeners just heard in the intro there was a suggestion from our Discord
by listener, I hope I'm pronouncing this correctly, Pottybok.
He hails from France, I believe, so thanks for that suggestion, because we thought we'd
try to make the show a little bit more accessible for people who might be jumping in and goodness
knows I don't know if anyone does this but doesn't actually go back to the beginning
of the whole RSS archive.
Apparently people have other things to do.
But yeah, hopefully now you know who we are if you've joined the show late, so welcome.
We don't actually do follow up very much, it's not a regular part of the show, but I
thought that we should do this given our last episode about the home row.
Jason, you brought up the home row as a category
of a topic of discussion
and how things have changed with inputs.
And then we had a listener suggest type-wise the keyboard.
And I thought that I would give it a crack.
For anyone who hasn't tried this before,
it's basically like a hexagonal key shaped keyboard.
And it's supposed to be centered around,
it's like thumb centric typing with the keys
generally in the QWERTY layout,
but wrapping around these jewel thumb buttons in the middle.
Have either of you tried this as well?
- I have not, no.
- I have, yes.
I've got thoughts.
So I'll supplement your review with my own comments, Martin.
So if you wanna give a bit of a feedback
as to how you've gone with it.
- Wait, is this gonna be a matrix thing all over again
where you guys just fight?
'Cause I don't know if I'm prepared for that
two times in a row.
- A review and a counter review.
No fights here, just healthy banter, Jason.
I don't want to spend too long obsessing over it, but I thought I'd give it a go since it was
kindly sent in. And yeah, it was a bit of an experiment for me because I thought, okay,
they've designed this keyboard to be for the mobile era rather than just porting what is on
a desktop keyboard onto a smaller screen. And I thought I'm going to challenge myself. And when
I started this, I got the concept, I got the idea of swiping and holding and quicker access and not
having to go down layers of stuff. But obviously my brain is completely focused on the type of
keyboard that I've been using since I was a kid. It's all this qwerty desktop layout.
So it's overcoming years and years of entrenched habits and finger movements and muscle memory.
And I thought I don't want to be, you know, the old dog who can't learn new tricks. So I've been
trying this for the past week or so. And it has been really challenging. I know that in the
tutorials it says that it takes about a week. I don't know if I'll stick with it in the long run.
I do find it somewhat frustrating and I'm also a guy who normally types with one thumb fairly
quickly anyway. So I've really just limited this to my iPhone rather than using it on the iPad or
something. And whenever an iMessage pops up and I respond to something, I try using it.
It has been difficult.
Two questions.
Question one, is it clear that this was a keyboard written for not a mini phone?
Because I have to imagine that they probably didn't test it on that.
So was that an issue?
And the state of third party keyboards in general, I completely forgot that they even
existed on iOS.
So clearly that's still a thing.
How is that experience?
Is it you never know what keyboard is going to pop up still?
Or is it basically you know, once you pick it, it's there in every single app, screen,
whatever.
Good questions.
So on the first thing, it does feel totally fine to me like it fits on the iPhone 12 mini.
So it doesn't feel like it's been shoehorned in.
You can change the size of the characters on the keys.
I've stuck with medium as opposed to large, which is a funny option given that there doesn't
appear to be a small.
So there is no technical medium between two other options.
up for them to resolve. The hexagonal keys do throw me off a little bit so maybe they
do make sense on a larger display. I mean I don't find myself needing a different layout
to reach over to the side. I do like the haptic feedback though that you get with each key
press which I think actually Apple could probably use with their own default keyboard. You can
actually get like a physical vibration with each key tap if you turn that on. In terms
of third party keyboards I don't really like the way that it fits into the look of the
the screen. It's either this solid block or has a weird fade to it and the color options
don't really do it for me. But it's generally been fine except occasionally I'll go back
to messages and the default keyboard is there when I didn't leave it that way to my memory.
So fine for the most part, but the occasional weird surprise.
Yeah, so I tried it for a few days and I had it on both the iPad and the iPhone 13 mini.
It fit okay on the 13 mini. It takes up a bit more screen space than the standard keyboard
just because of the nature of the
hexagons it has to
Similarly touch typist for many years
I've tried and I just think I'm too slow and I make too many mistakes with it and I get frustrated
Particularly on the iPad. It doesn't play well with the the smart folio
Keyboard, so sometimes you get sort of no keyboard or it doesn't seem to register that you've got it plugged in
And and so it will come up anyway
I think as even though you're trying to use the normal keyboard and then if you try to switch to emoji
It just doesn't it doesn't work
So I gave up on that pretty quickly
I think it's it's suffering because like Jason said the iOS support for third-party keyboards is pretty horrible and you do get that
Random what keyboard am I gonna get this time? I didn't like it
Really trying to get to
I
Appreciate maybe if you were a complete keyboard neophyte it might work for you and I get the science that it would it may be
as more efficient
But I think the fact it's still it's kind of this halfway house because it's still bounded to the QWERTY principles
I think it would actually be a better keyboard if it just went full Dvorak or something like that and said like we're gonna put
keys wherever the most efficient space is for them to be rather than trying to
bend the QWERTY keyboard around a space to spacebar thumb buttons in the middle
so yeah I just couldn't I couldn't jive with it. So it's really more of a you put
new keycaps on your keyboard versus this is a whole new wild way to enter text
is what it sounds like. Not even new keycaps because the keycaps are still
kind of in the same spot, they've just been bent.
- It's the special characters and the things
that are different, I would say, on that second layer.
- Yeah, what I did find nifty was the swipe to delete
and undelete, instead of backs, backs, backs,
you would just slide your finger across
and it would delete letters as you go back
and then you could swipe forward again
and they would reappear.
In actual fact, what I used the other day,
the new version of Outlook for iOS.
And it has taken a different approach to this.
It does predictive text of what you're going to type
for the rest of your sentence.
And it sort of puts shadow text up
ahead of where your carrot is,
predicting what you're going to write.
And then if you agree to that's what you're going to write,
you can just swipe forward and it fills the rest in.
It's weird, it's freaky, and it's very accurate.
And you realize how much of what I write
is never unique or interesting whatsoever
because the computer can predict what I'm gonna say.
- Or can we question whether it is in fact prediction
and it's actually changing what you're gonna write?
- Well, that's the other thing, yes, it does.
And you're in this weird headspace of like,
"I guess I could say that." (laughs)
- Submit to the machine, Andrew,
submit to the corporate machine.
- Yeah, yeah, it's a bit that way.
So I kind of, I liked it and didn't like that feature
all at the same time,
but it's a more efficient way of typing
because you don't type.
Interesting approach.
- What I will say about this though,
I wanna thank a listener, Phil,
who actually tweeted it in and that's how we discovered it.
What I liked about what he said
was that it took him some practice,
but one of the things that he really enjoys
about this thumb optimized keyboard, as he said,
is that no one in the family can actually type on his phone
if they happen to be holding it.
(laughing)
So, I mean, you said, you know,
maybe it's good for keyboard neophytes, Android.
I would agree with that largely.
But in this case, we have someone
who's a self-professed tech enthusiast on Twitter saying,
"I put in the hard yards, I switched."
So I'm glad it works for him.
And I'm glad that someone's trying
different inputs out there.
But look, if anyone out there does have
some sort of privacy or security concern,
or doesn't want people sending messages on their phone
without them knowing, if that's even a thing,
this is obviously the keyboard for you.
- How many thumbs would we give this?
most appropriately thumbed thing we could review.
And Andrew, how many thumbs, how many Andrew thumbs on that?
I'm giving it one half thumb, just the half thumb that taps the screen.
Just that half thumb.
Okay. So one front nub.
And Martin, how many?
Out of five Andrew thumbs, I would give it four because even though I don't know if I'll stick with it in the long run,
I really admire that someone tried something different.
It's familiar enough that you can start using it straight away,
but it actually challenges you to do things a bit differently.
And things like the haptics and the color designs, I think it's really creative.
So to keep this topic going for as long as possible, I have one last question.
Do you use any other third party keyboards ever in the last 10 years?
Just in general?
Deleted all of them.
I've tried them, don't like them.
It's iOS that's the problem.
It manages them terribly.
Yeah, that was my the most curious thing I was wondering when you guys did this was has that
changed at all, regardless of if the keyboard itself was any good? Has the actual implementation
changed? I assumed no, because it was like, here's third party keyboards, never touched again, like
whatever code base that part of iOS has not been checked out by anybody in like eight years,
I'm sure. Well, despite all of that, I think this is the best one that I've tried. And I'd
I'd encourage people to give it a go at least.
- The other best new keyboard that I never remember to use
is now the built-in swipe keyboard.
You used to have to install a third party keyboard
to get that.
And now you can just swipe on your keys and...
- Natasha is a swiping fiend.
I can't use it.
I love swiping with my pencil on that keyboard
with the iPad, but not on the iPhone.
- Martin, what iPad would that be that you're writing on
with that cool pencil?
- Oh, you mean this one, the new iPad Mini 6th generation?
- iPad mini 6.
- Oh, the iPad cute.
- It is adorable.
- My order finally arrived.
- That's great.
How, that was like about a month.
Was that something like that?
- Oh, something like that.
It projected two months,
but then in typical Apple style,
they went, oh, it's already coming to you.
So they really did that whole under promise thing.
- So do you have some opening statements on it
before I have a very critical question,
which I wasn't allowed to ask on chat the other day.
I had to save it for the show.
- Yeah, you gotta save that up.
So, but I'll allow you to have a, maybe an opening gambit.
- So I got myself the iPad mini 256 gigabyte wifi only
in space gray with the black little smart folio,
the back and front cover.
And my intention for this device was to have
a nice little addition in the realm of entertainment,
reading, things away from typing and keyboards
and audio editing and all of that.
So I love the size and I'm glad that I got it.
That's my little opening statement.
256, he said.
Yep.
I think that's what I don't remember what I got.
I think I got that.
Isn't there? There's only there's only medium and large, I think.
Right. For the iPad mini, if I remember right, in terms of storage.
I think it's 64 and 256.
I might have misremembered. So it's like small or large.
Medium. Everything's medium and large now.
Medium. Medium and large.
And you got space gray and then the black cover.
Got it. OK.
Well, I'm going to let actually I feel like Andrew's got a got a burning
question here. Why don't you go ahead?
Okay, well let me start with the preamble because you but you boys are both your influences on me
That's what they call me on Instagram
That's right
so I was walking down the street the other day and I was telling Hannah about the fact that both of you have iPad minis and
Therefore I want one too and I said to her but the problem is I have absolutely zero purpose for an iPad mini
I have a mini phone
Okay, so I got the mini phone because I like to use that as just as a phone and really not that much else
But I have the, what would it be, the 10th, the 11 inch iPad, small iPad, pro.
Medium.
And for me, that is the device that I use, like most people would probably use their phone.
And I love it, and it's perfect, and I can hold it comfortably in one hand.
I have big hands.
You have big hands.
Look at him, look at him, he's palming an 11 inch iPad, like it's nothing.
Piece of cake, right?
So.
Yeah, your hands are bigger than mine.
So my question is, as cute as the Mini is, is it not just another device in which I have
to manage and install apps and put updates on and keep one password updated and all these
little bits and pieces?
What am I missing in my current experience of a small phone and a medium-sized iPad?
Well, I would say that it's not necessary.
It's not necessary at all.
iPads in general, you could probably just say,
you don't need an iPad, right?
A lot of people don't even need a Mac
or an equivalent Windows PC.
The iPhone or equivalent Android handset
is pretty much all that most people need
as people discovered recently listening
to your father-in-law, Mr. Kim Beazley, right?
He only has an iPhone.
So you don't really need an iPad mini.
Where it fits in for me is I essentially thought
of ordering an iPad mini a while ago.
And even when they were saying there would be rumors
of like an iPad Air style redesign,
I thought, oh, that's the one I want.
Then the iPad Pro came out and I went,
actually this is more the laptop equivalent
or replacement that I wanted for all the pro stuff
or doing audio editing, typing work, whatever.
And then this came along and I thought,
oh, I don't need it, right?
Jason got one and I saw the benefits of it,
but I thought I'm gonna resist.
And then the thing that really switched it over for me
was there are all these times that I wanna sit down
read something like RSS or news articles or newsletters that I've subscribed to or micro.blog
or even just carry something around as a simple sketch machine or to watch videos on. And even
though the iPad Pro 11 inches is a lovely size and it's like the laptop style tablet equivalent for
me, it just doesn't really suit sitting down or leaning back in bed in the same way when you want
want to read something. So to me the whole solution of managing the devices is it doesn't
have everything on it that is necessarily on my iPhone or that is on the other iPad.
It's a more focused device for reading and entertainment. So if you attempt to clone
everything from your equivalent iPad or iPhone onto this iPad mini, yeah, it's going to be
more of a nightmare and you're going to be updating stuff that you don't even use. So
for me it's a behavioral adjustment to make sure that I get the maximum out of this more
minimal product, but to be totally upfront with you, it is a luxury. I don't really need
it. It's purely for enjoyment.
Okay. Second question, if I may ask, I am a fan of using my iPad in portrait mode. I
know that's generally frowned upon to hold it in portrait, but I like reading, like you
just said, in portrait mode. And that seems to be a sales pitch for the mini, but does
it not suffer the jelly scrolling in portrait mode?
I'm not saying it's not there, apparently, but in my use of it, I have not seen anything
that I would regard as horrible or seriously noticeable.
Even the lack of something like ProMotion, I don't care.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Because that was the other thing.
I thought that ProMotion would be a big deal.
I think it's one of those things where, I mean, you'll see pro YouTubers, for example,
talking about the things that it does or doesn't have.
One thing that I've heard a lot about this iPad mini is the display is okay, I guess,
right?
I think this is in the area of nitpicking.
If you have space in your life for a small tablet, which is very convenient to hold and
you can enjoy things like entertainment and reading on, then it's wonderful.
If your job is to present lots and lots of specifications because listeners or viewers
expect you to say this versus this, and that's better than that, then of course you're going
to be fixated on those things or you might actually notice things more than the average
user. All of those things are totally fine and the Jelly Scrolling has not leapt out
of me at all.
Yeah, a couple of... I mostly agree with everything that Martin has said. I do have the mini,
I think it's basically the same one you have. I got the orange cover because it's orange
so of course I got that one. The thing for me, I guess, is that... is it required? No,
Of course not, that would be insane to say that it was.
For me, I'm a little bit of a different case though
because I have the 13 inch iPad Pro.
So for me, the iPad mini really is a distinct device
in the iPad realm.
So there's that, which is why I went with the mini.
If I was using the 11,
it would have been probably a harder decision, I think,
because they are closer.
although I still think there'd be value.
The other piece is that the iPad mini in my tech view,
if you wanna call it, the iPad mini is an iPad.
The iPad Pro 13 inch is a modular laptop.
- I agree with that.
- I didn't feel like I was getting another iPad.
I felt like I was getting my first iPad
in the sense of what you would do with an iPad
where there's no keyboard attached to it.
It's a slab of glass that I mostly just interact with
in terms of reading something or looking at something.
I'm not creating anything on it,
except I do use it as a small notebook
for taking to meetings or whatever at work
where I can just pop that open,
drag up from the bottom right,
do a quick little note and have it be synced to my computer.
So that's the only creating I'm really doing on it.
It's great for referencing all of my craft notes.
I reference them a lot on there.
I don't enter a lot of information.
I may tweak a sentence here or there,
but I'm not writing blog posts on it or anything like that.
So it's very much a have the information available to me,
especially like around the house where my phone is,
I don't know where my phone is to be perfectly honest,
because this is just, it's the right size screen
where I feel like the phone is just too small
and too compromised for almost everything
where I'm constantly having to swipe back and forth
to get the menu back so I can select a new thing
and now I'm in this view and that whole song and dance.
So it's completely luxury,
but I do feel like it is the best example of the essence
of what the word iPad is meant to be.
Whereas the iPad Pros are very much modular laptops
is what I would call them.
Great now this episode is costing me what twenty five hundred dollars. I gotta buy a new I gotta buy an iPad
Pro big one and use a new smart keyboard to go with that and an iPad mini
I have negatives. Hold on. Let me give you the negatives on the iPad mini
It's not all sunshine and rainbows over here an iPad mini land touch ID. I don't like it
I gotta say I love it stand it. I I I
I love the implementation. Sorry to interrupt.
I think it is such a step backwards in terms of getting into my device.
I now look at it and have to figure out and remember, okay, wait, okay, it's facing this way.
So now the touch ID buttons here, make sure I register the fingers on that hand.
Oh, wait, now it's the other way. Let me make sure I've got enough fingers registered on that side.
And then I got to hold it and then keep holding to fully unlock.
Okay, cool, let me do that some more.
So it's fine, I think it lends itself better to the phone,
to be perfectly honest,
'cause my thumb is right where the stupid button is anyway.
Just an observation that I've had.
So yeah, it's fine, it's got Touch ID.
Cool, if it had Face ID,
it'd be like 40 million times better.
The screen thing you mentioned about the jelly scrolling,
I don't fully quite understand what that is.
to me that's just, it's not ProMotion.
That's what LCD screens always looked like, I thought.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong,
but I just took that to be,
we got used to ProMotion and what that looked like
on the iPad Pros.
And then when we got an LCD screen again,
it was like, wait, this doesn't look as good.
Well, yeah, it's not ProMotion.
It's gonna be.
- Yeah, I think it is a bit different
'cause I think the iPad Air doesn't have ProMotion,
but also doesn't have this problem,
if you want to call it a problem.
I don't personally say, Oh my God, the jelly scrolling.
Again, that feels a bit like a, I have to do a review to make sure I get 10
million YouTube views.
So I have to have like a negative thing to say about an Apple product.
Um, maybe you see it, maybe you don't.
I don't, maybe it's a subjective thing where certain people, it affects them.
And, you know, cause I know there's people that work where they can't even look at
promotion, right?
Where that just like makes them feel weird somehow.
I could never understand that.
I don't, that doesn't, it doesn't do it to me.
So this may be like that,
where if your brain is wired in just the right way,
you see, you know, jelly scrolling.
I don't know.
I would say go to a store and like scroll on one
for 10 minutes and see if it does it for you
before you buy one maybe,
but I don't really see that to be an issue.
That being said, with promotion,
I would love it another 4 million times more.
I'm a big fan of the promotion,
but it doesn't have that, but mostly that's okay.
I'm, because of the stuff I'm doing on it,
it's not a huge deal.
You know, I'm doing handwriting notes.
If it's like a half a millisecond behind my pencil,
like I don't care, whatever.
And the price is pretty decent given what it is.
I think the covers seem to have gotten very costly.
I'm not sure.
- That's the rot, the covers are the rot, yeah.
Those need to come down about 20 or $30 I think.
- They're the floor mats of the new car purchase.
- It really felt that way, yeah, for sure.
But it is USB-C, so that's great.
You know, there's always that fear
that they're gonna somehow do a lightning thing
and I'm gonna have to figure that out,
but it seems like iPad is pretty good on USB-C.
And just that form factor with the,
like the way the pros look with the square,
whatever that we're calling that now,
that design language. It's been great. I use it every day. I still use it every day, multiple
times a day. I read books on it every night in bed. It's great for that because it's super
light. Even if I drop it on my face, it's fine. I'm not going to die. Like if I drop
the 13 Pro on my face, you know, start writing my Obit because I'm dead.
One of the things that I love about this iPad, away from the device itself, is that because
it's 256 gigs and it's an entertainment specific device, I have been able, with chunks of room
left to download every single episode of Seinfeld onto this thing.
So I now have a portable Seinfeld machine.
So as long as I have this with me, even if there's no internet connection, didn't have
to get a cellular one, that has to be the height of nerdy luxury to take Seinfeld with
you.
I think this is the only device like this,
but the button configuration is weird
in that all the buttons are on the top of the device.
So the power button is on the top
and both volume buttons are on the top.
And it's completely out of necessity
because one side, the buttons would be covered
inside the case and the other side,
the pencil attaches to it.
I don't know if we even talked about that,
but the Pencil 2 does have that cool little magnetic thing,
which is fantastic.
so you can't put the buttons there,
so they're all on the top,
which was very strange at first
because no device has ever had volume buttons on the top.
But the cool thing with the Mini,
and somebody can correct me,
maybe the iPad Air does this too, I don't have one,
but if you turn the device to the left
where the buttons are on the left,
the volume up and down works where up is up
and down is down,
and if you flip it around the other way,
it's still, the way it's facing, up is up and down is down
in terms of volume.
So it's swapping what the buttons are doing
based on orientation, which sounds like
that would be a nightmare, but it's super intuitive
because if it's sitting in front of you, up is up.
It's very intuitive and I think it's a very elegant way
to handle the hardware buttons, which usually,
you can't, once hardware is fixed, you can't change it,
but in this case, it works nicely.
So Andrew, you don't need an iPad mini.
No one needs an iPad mini.
I think both Jason and I fully accept
that this is a luxury purchase.
Although I would encourage,
if anyone out there is listening who doesn't have an iPad
or wants to get a new iPad,
the key selling point for this would be
if you don't want an iPad,
which is designed to also maybe be a laptop,
whether it's a smaller or larger modular kind of laptop,
as Jason said, this is really pure,
tiny little sketchbook carry around tablet.
- It's also, it's not the crap one.
Like in the past where, because it was the small one,
it had like the old processor or just had crap features.
Like the iPhone mini where it got the same stuff.
The iPad mini has the latest and greatest,
A, whatever it has, chip.
It's got all the goods in it,
minus obviously the stuff that would be in a pro,
like ProMotion and all that stuff,
because building products, that's how that works.
But it's not, it has no compromises in that respect
just because it's small, they didn't skip out.
- I'm just looking at the shopping page.
It's a real shame they didn't do a 128 gigabyte
'cause it feels like 64 is a bit small.
256 is probably overkill.
- Oh yeah, that's by design for sure.
Nobody's getting the 64.
I almost did actually.
I thought about it and I was like, it's probably fine,
but what if it's not?
- Yeah, that's where they get you.
But yeah, I would say definitely get one, Andrew, for sure.
100%.
- Great.
I'll take it up with Hannah.
- Angel and demon on your shoulder.
(upbeat music)
This is a topic that's been in the show notes
or at least our topic pool for ages.
And I wanted to drag it up
because I wanted to know what Jason had to say.
I'm sure you have something to add, Andrew.
It was about the fact that gaming is getting weird
in parentheses in a good way.
Now, since resurrecting this topic,
Jason has added a chunk of bullet points.
Jason, why is gaming getting weird?
- Gaming is getting weird because of the fact
that gaming used to mean get a console or a computer,
purchase software for said console or computer and play it.
And that was kind of it.
That was where the line was drawn.
Then we got, you could download games onto consoles,
which was basically the same as getting discs or cartridges,
but now they're just coming over the internet, no big deal.
But I feel like lately, in maybe the last two to three years,
it feels like things are getting weird
in the way that you look at things like,
I think we talked briefly about xCloud not too long ago,
where you have this platform
that is completely internet-based,
that you open a web browser and play triple A,
you know, high level, max quality games
in a web browser on your phone in your pocket
over 5G or whatever while you're driving down the road.
That's mind boggling that A, that works at all
and that we've reached that level of compute.
But even then past that,
now we're moving into subscription services
where we have things like Apple Arcade is one of them,
which is, I think it's still a pretty good thing to have.
I think it maybe is suffering a little bit from--
- There's no good games.
There's no good games for it.
Just admit it.
It's garbage.
- Okay.
(laughs)
All right, we've got that opinion over there
on the far right.
Apple Arcade, we've got, you know,
usual Steam and all that,
but then you also have things like Xbox Game Pass,
where you pay them X dollars a month
and you just get everything they have.
And they're all really good games
that you would normally pay $60 a piece for,
but now you're paying, you know,
20 bucks a month or whatever it is,
which is a fantastic deal, I have to say.
And also just the fact that there's a lot of like
retro stuff that's coming back around,
but not just retro for retro's sake.
There's usually a twist on it.
So like the analog pocket that I talked about a while back
where it's this like ground up rebuild system
to play old games, but it does like, you know,
pixel for pixel mapping, but it's all 10X.
So it looks gorgeous.
I recently ordered something called a PolyMega.
- This looks pretty impressive.
I looked at it.
- A modern console that has modules that you put in
so it can play, you know, PS1, PS2, Sega CD,
put in a module, put in N64 cartridges,
put in another module, put in Sega Master System,
all of them, and it just has these modules you plug in,
and it's all obviously modern,
so it comes out HDMI and all that.
I think it's kinda cool that all this stuff
is happening right now,
and I don't think it's by any coincidence
that a lot of the people that grew up
in that era of '80s, '90s of video games
are now in, we're having children age
and we want to pass that down,
but we're also now in a position to be able to
create things like this in an easier way.
So it's kind of this cool pass down of generational stuff
whereas previously it'd be like,
here's my newspaper clippings from whatever time frame,
but now it's like, here's a modern system
where you can play my copy of GoldenEye from N64
back in 1996.
When I say weird, it's just that
everything has been turned on its head
and now we're just recently, within the last weeks,
we're now in this new era of,
we had the old tech companies,
every tech company is, there's like five
and they're all just buying everything up
until there's only five companies left,
much like how Coca-Cola and Pepsi
bought up all the fast food chains
and now there's only two companies there.
Now we're seeing that with gaming,
where there was a couple of huge acquisitions
in the last couple of weeks,
and then just most recently, Sony bought another one.
So now we're having this reverse kind of roll up
into these larger umbrella companies.
I don't know if that part is necessarily in a good way,
but it's happening because there's a lot of money in gaming,
and I think we've all known that for a long time,
but movies have always been looked at as,
"Oh, it's fine to make billions of dollars on that.
Movies are fine."
Gaming was always looked at as this kind of stepchild of like,
"Oh, yeah, it makes a lot of money, but games are bad."
- This is what worries me.
It's that the business model is becoming the key element
of the gaming industry, not production of games.
It's not about having a cool game that people like
and are willing to pay 80 bucks for.
It's about how can we own this content
and make sure we're getting our revenue per month
of every user and it's just, it's getting, it's really big business like you say and
it just seems like the joy is being sucked out of it because everybody now wants to own
you in their little silo.
You know, like you've got to be an Xbox customer and pay us a monthly fee and you're going
to be a Sony customer and I feel like you either end up going, "Oh, it's all too hard
And it's only for the hardcore gamers or you pick a tribe and you're stuck with it.
And then the other option is it's going to be like how all the streaming services have become.
So now you've got to have Netflix, Stan in Australia, Disney.
You've got to have them all because there'll be one title that you want to watch.
And it just it's it's user hostile.
I just don't like the whole subscription direction.
It's mirroring the streaming services very closely.
The only real difference is that the hardware
is not democratized at this point, right?
Where like right now, you know, get a Amazon Fire TV
or a Roku or Apple TV or whatever,
and they pretty much all have all the apps.
You can watch it.
I mean, shit, you buy a TV now
and it has all the damn apps on it.
You don't even need a box anymore.
Whereas right now, if you want, you know, Xbox game pass, you need to have an Xbox.
If you want to have PlayStation, whatever.
But even that feels like that's probably not too far off where when you look at
things like X cloud, you don't need a console for that.
You just log into a browser and you play.
It doesn't matter what, what you have.
Well, the fact that it's impossible to buy a console at the moment, true.
They need to hurry that, that system up.
Yeah.
It also feels a little offensive that they're offering these subscription
services while you can't even buy their hardware.
That being said about not being able to buy consoles, and I mentioned this as Jason said
when we've discussed the Xbox subscription before, I've actually been trying out the
Xbox Cloud Gaming Beta on the iPad Mini that I was just talking about before with the Nimbus
Plus controller by SteelSeries.
I've got a photo, we'll throw it linked in the show notes.
I don't have a modern Xbox.
The last Xbox that I bought was the Xbox 360 and it still sits in my entertainment unit
today because I love Forza Motorsport 3 on that thing. I don't think they have that available in
the current library. And don't get me started on the more recent Forzas, which I'm not into.
That whole open world drive to your next event, where you got the landscaping achievement because
you hit a cactus when you went off road. I don't want that. That's the best achievement, though.
I just want to drive a simulation game. But it's great just playing in the browser. I mean,
I don't own an Xbox. So a positive to the whole subscription thing is that I cannot be a diehard
Xbox console gamer, but still kind of be able to be part of the ecosystem on this little thing
and play it at my leisure. So I think you're right, Andrew, it's annoying, because if you
really are into games, you have to pay for everything. But on the flip side, if you do
want to dabble in stuff or go in and out and not commit to having this big thing in your
entertainment unit, you've got some more choice than what you did before.
You're talking about right now, we're not having to have a console, even the consoles are part of
of the subscription now where you pay $30 a month
and you get an Xbox, whatever the latest Xbox is,
and Xbox Game Pass, and you're just locked in
at 30 bucks a month for, and then when a new console
comes out, they send you the new one.
That's kind of where this is all going.
I really like the cloud thing.
I think that's like a super cool way to go.
For me personally, it's still not quite to the level
of having the PS5 hooked up to my TV.
So for me, being an avid gamer,
I still prefer having that physical console,
but we're not far off to where those two things are not,
you won't be able to tell the difference anymore.
And that is exciting to where I would love a world
where I could sit at my iMac,
open up a app or a browser or whatever,
play the game there.
Oh, I'm gonna go on vacation.
cool, I can bring my iPad with me, play it on there, and it all just follows me where I go,
and not have to drag around a giant PS5 in a suitcase or something. Not that I would do that,
but that's what I would have to do if I wanted to play those games, you know, somewhere else.
But see, that's where, sorry to interrupt you, that's where I think arcade has a lot of hope,
but kind of falls flat in some areas. Because I'll be honest, I agree largely with what Andrew said
about there not being a huge number of super exciting games, but there have been moments of
unbelievable creativity. I found some really cool stuff on there. There's a really, really simple
game called Lifeslide that I've been playing on Apple Arcade. If either of you heard of this,
you fly a paper aeroplane, right? Which sounds like, okay, great. But I would say with a
controller on the Apple TV or even on the iPad, it's so simple, but so engrossing in how you have
to fly this thing because it's not like accelerating a normal car. The game developers for Lifeslide
have thought about when you throw a paper aeroplane, throw it too low and you hit the
ground and create friction. Throw it too high, the air catches it and it doesn't go anywhere.
So some of the mechanics that I've seen in some of the games that I've tried are unlike things
that I've tried elsewhere. Even one called the Mosaic where it's this kind of, it's a
tried and true kind of formula or premise, but you're this cog in the machine of the corporate
world. And you go through these scenes and the gameplay differs. And at one point, you're walking
down the street, but then it splits and you fly this butterfly through this dreary, dystopian
construction site and try to avoid all the tools and workers. And then it flips back to the actual
character that you're moving in the game. So I think Apple Arcade has these cool creative moments,
but it doesn't kind of realize the potential of what you were saying, Jason, with something like
like the PlayStation where an avid gamer would go in and have this all cross platform and
cool stuff for controllers.
I kind of wish for more with arcade.
Apple Arcade's hamstrung itself because they want everything to be playable everywhere.
So it's got to be touch, touch controls, and also an Apple TV remote control.
Which it's not.
I just ran into this the other day.
There was a game that came out and I was like, oh cool, I want to play that on the Apple
TV.
It's not on the Apple TV.
only on the phone and iPad.
Really? They've gone away from that, have they?
Yeah.
I was like, wait, I thought the whole point was that I could, or no, I'm sorry, I wanted to play it on my iMac.
And it was only, I couldn't, it wasn't showing up in Apple Arcade on the App Store on my Mac.
I was like, what the hell?
I thought that was the whole point, is that I could play them on everything.
So that was annoying.
I don't know if maybe that's a weird edge case or I hit some weird bug or something, but it just wasn't there.
I just think I think Apple need to lean into it and just go we've got different games that suit different
UIs and just go with it and also sell a controller like
License that you know make a Nimbus equivalent
That's got an Apple logo on it and just sell it and really and I think then the Apple TV could become something worthwhile
Now until they do that until they really get the controller
Sorted it's never gonna take off. You need to make that thing almost just it comes with it. I don't know
It's got to be a bundle there has to be a an Apple TV 4k whatever and then there's the Apple TV
Gaming edition or whatever and it comes with you know
Two controllers and Apple TV a chip that was actually made within the last year
Because that that was kind of the sign to me that that was not really a motivation for them
was that the last Apple TV came out and it was still like three years old chip and it was like
- Hmm, that kind of tells me that this is not really meant
to be the powerhouse gaming platform.
- Put an M1 in it.
- Right, or do that, right?
Have the Apple TV 4K with the three-year-old chip
because you don't need anything more than that
to play movies, and then have the gamer edition
that has the M1 in it, comes with two controllers,
it's $600 or whatever overpriced thing you want to do,
I don't care, and have that as an option.
Like, come to the table, let people tell you that this is not what they want.
Put it out there and see what happens.
I just feel like because the option doesn't exist, it's like, it's not chicken and egg, really, but it's this, it's not picking up because the things are not there that people want.
Where I see the opportunity for Apple and gaming is kind of what they did a little bit with Apple TV.
So they bought the rights to things like Fraggle Rock and Snoopy.
There isn't really much in the way of a licensed archive,
but little familiar things make people go,
oh, I like Snoopy, I'll go check that out
for my kids or whatever.
As far as gaming goes, recently on the App Store
and on, I think it was Xbox Game Pass as well,
you can now play the reimagined
or remastered version of Myst.
So think about all of those games out there
that are fan favorites.
You brought up Goldeneye, for example, earlier, Jason,
but that might not have compatibility on newer consoles.
Go and buy up old games that have been forgotten,
that people out there would love to be able to play again,
that the original platforms have forgotten
or don't care about anymore,
port them over to Apple Arcade,
and then suddenly you can say,
play game X, which you've never been able to play since.
I reckon people would jump on that.
(upbeat music)
- My job, I have a Mac,
and for not great reasoning,
No one consulted me before purchasing it.
(sighs)
Heavy sigh.
So I got an M1 MacBook Pro with eight gigs of RAM.
And I was like, well, you know, this is that new RAM,
so maybe it's fine.
It hasn't really been fine overall.
I find a lot of things to be very sluggish.
I feel like I need to reboot all the time.
But I think I found the culprit.
And that is I plug this laptop into a 32 inch,
4K, LG, whatever the hell monitor.
Love the monitor, monitor's great.
It's phenomenal monitor.
But the other day I was for some reason using my laptop
just as a laptop, not connected.
Everything was perfectly fine.
And then I went and went back to the monitor again,
and things started going south again.
So somehow I think there's an issue
with the fact that it's driving a large monitor,
and I don't do dual screen, I have it in shut mode,
but I think that is somehow eating up
a lot of system resources to drive that huge monitor.
- Well, it would do.
You think about the amount of memory it takes.
I mean, look at your normal graphics card,
How much memory does that have?
And 4K display.
It's only a 4K monitor though.
I didn't really think that would be that big of a deal, but apparently maybe it is.
So I think if you're just using it as a laptop, if you're going to go buy a Mac and you only
use it as a laptop and you just do normal stuff, I think 8 gigs actually is probably
fine for basically everyone.
Unless you're actually connecting it to a big giant external monitor, that may be a
So I a point of comparison I'm looking at my system information for this iMac that I'm seeing in front of it has a
Radeon Pro
575 X
Graphics card to drive the home I've tried the 5k display it has for 4 gigabytes of RAM just for that graphics card
So if you think about that, so that's 4 gigs of your 8 gigs being taken there abouts
on your display
Needless to say my next my next computers work computer will not be a kicks.
They should have consulted you.
You would think being the only Mac user in the entire organization they might maybe ask me what I would want but here we are.
That's not how corporate America works.
Martin when you order a coffee what size coffee do you get.
In Australia I would say a small.
a piccolo. Which is, I think, well, no, that's the thing. So, I think a small in
American language would be eight ounces. Probably, yeah.
Yeah, so, if I order a small flat white with two shots, which is my regular order,
I think it equates to eight ounces. Some cafes will sell a six ounce,
which is between a piccolo and a small flat white. Yeah, I think it's like eight, twelve, sixteen.
To me, ounce is a weight. I don't really understand a volumetric measure of ounce.
So once again, the Americans really stuffing up any form of measurement that they have to do.
I usually pick medium and I'll get a medium flat white. I don't do, I just get the normal,
I think a medium comes with two shots as a standard approach. I think that's how I get my two shots.
But is that to compensate for more milk or do you end up with a much stronger flavor?
Nah, it's to compensate for the slightly higher volume of milk.
I get frustrated because of it.
See, I have a small one to have a stronger coffee.
Yeah, but I get frustrated because I have a small one, it disappears too quick.
And I feel like I need a bit more fluid entering my system.
Jason, what do Americans do?
You just go to that urn thing and just like squeeze out some coffee from that was made six hours ago.
And is that how it works at the gas station?
Yep, that's exactly right.
That's the only place that you can get coffee here is from a six-hour-old gas station.
It actually comes out of the pump. So, fun fact.
So like Homer Simpson with the one for you, one for me at the Bowser.
Yep. Our cars run on the same thing that we drink.
And is it like one of those big gulp sort of style drinks that you would fill up?
That's the only size cups that we import into the country is big gulp size.
I believe the technical term is jumbo grande venti.
Slash medium large.
And you can always see Mark Harmon carrying one on NCIS. That's what he walks around with.
What do you get, Jason? Okay. What do you order as a coffee?
I generally will order from my kitchen because I don't go anywhere.
Generally, I'll do about 16 ounces of cold brew coffee every day. That's usually my go-to.
Okay, can I be an idiot? When we say cold brew coffee, is it actually cold coffee or is it just being cold brewed? You're drinking it as a cold?
You can go either way. I take it literally as a cold coffee, but you can have hot cold brew, I guess you could call it. You could heat it up, sure, yeah, you could do that.
But it's also not espresso, is it? It's a type of drip.
No, it's yeah, it's a like a coffee ground thing that sits in the...
It's cold brew because it sits... it doesn't brew using hot water. That's where the cold comes from.
You actually brew it by just having it sit for like... kind of depends on what it is, usually around 12 hours
in the refrigerator.
And then it's uh, then you take out the grounds and it's a delicious
Smooth cup of coffee and I think some Tori boss that that has espresso and cold brew options doesn't it it does
Yes, there's little metal cans if you want your coffee in a can. Yeah, I
Don't like the little metallic best thing ever the slightly metallic tang you get when you drink out of one of those
That's how you know, you're living
The thing that the thing that kind of disturbs me about those cans
Although I enjoy the drinks that are in them
is that the weight of the can at the bottom is such that when you've finished your last sip
and you put it down and then you pick it up again to dispose of it, like throw it in recycling,
you think there's still something in it. You think you have a sip left and then you get
tricked. It's the trick sip. And I'm not sure if that weighting is done to avoid can tip over in
a slight breeze or if it's actually to create a sense of cognitive dissonance because you end
up thinking there's more coffee than what you had. I think it's a marketing thing because you pick it
up and you go, "Oh, thank goodness. I have one more sip left." And then you go,
"Oh, disappointment." And then you have to go get another one because you were so
set on having that last sip that I might as well get a whole other one. I also
don't like those cans because I don't know if they're eligible as part of our
recycling program. We have a 10 cent deposit scheme here in Western Australia.
So, you take your empty glass bottles, empty aluminium bottles and you get
10 cents back for each one. But because that's more steel rather than aluminium, I don't
know if it qualifies for 10 cents back.
Well, steel's very infinitely recyclable, but I don't know what that means to the program.
When they're sorting, do they have a steel bucket?
Just use a magnet. Just magnet it. Whatever magnets, throw it on the steel side. Doesn't
matter if it's a magnet, throw it on the other side. OK.
