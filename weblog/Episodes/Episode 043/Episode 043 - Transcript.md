Music.
Just having a sip of my coffee to get rid of some of this sexy morning voice of got going on here hey,
I'll get rid of it just just like amp it up.
Do you wanna do you wanna take a quick break and have like a cigar or something just to really get this thing going.
That should smooth the throat I hear it has good medicinal properties well that would be very mad man and I've got my mad man advertising here going on you do look back to ready to buy ads right now what are you selling deal for you but we'll have to have a cognac first.
Maybe scotch then a cognac.
Well it is 9am so let's do that.
Fortunately I have a screenshot of this chat so we can show everyone your slick business here.
You had a question about Christmas time holiday differences Jason that's what I can see the notes here between the north and the south.
Jingle bells jingle bells yeah I'm very interested in this this seems like something that the world needs to know about because.
Not only are you all upside down constantly, right?
We're flip-flopped.
And so much about Christmas time, holiday time,
whatever you want to call it, is based in cold weather.
For us, generally, right?
I mean, it's in December, cold winter.
And so much stuff stereotypically is snow-based
or I feel like Northern Hemisphere based.
I could be wrong on that, but I had some questions about such things.
So obviously right now for me, it's November 27th.
Same fruit. No. November 28 there.
I don't know. Time zones.
Anyway, we're coming up on Christmas and we just did Thanksgiving.
That has nothing to do with you guys.
So who cares? Moving on.
Christmas time though, that is something that we actually both do.
And you don't do Halloween either, so that was another one, that was the one previous.
Don't care.
Okay, fine.
This is the first one we've had in a while where we match up.
So I wanted to know a couple of things.
So first of all, obviously it doesn't snow there during Christmas, so you have summer
Christmas.
Very interesting.
I think a lot of people would be very thrown off by that here, for sure.
So does everything else match up?
In other words, do you have Christmas trees that are like the stereotypical kind of pine
tree looking thing, or do you do something else?
Let's start there.
Trees, go.
Okay, well, I'll start on trees, if you're okay with that, Andrew.
So this would differ, you know, some people have fake trees, some people have real trees,
but generally the Christmas tree in Australia is still a very big thing and we've inherited
that as you've rightly identified from the Northern Hemisphere, British heritage, all
that sort of thing, generally as the major cultural group, I suppose, for better or worse.
But yeah, personally, I grew up with a real tree in the house.
So you're right, we're in the middle of a hot summer.
generally. It can either be really dry or really wet, at least on the East Coast, you
know, here in Wollongong. This year is a La Nina, so we're going to have a lot of rain,
I think, potentially. But growing up with that smell of the Christmas tree in the house
was still a very big thing with decorations. And at least when I was a kid, people still
sent Christmas greeting cards. And so in our pole frame house, you would just have these
cards hanging on the beams and rafters. Not really a thing digitally these days. But yeah,
say at least over here, people very much enjoy the summer aspect. You know, I've experienced
a cold winter Christmas before in the Northern Hemisphere. I found it all very romantic and
lovely but kind of pined, to use that tree term, for the summer Christmas where you could actually
get out and about, go to the beach, have picnics with friends, that sort of thing, and not kind of
be stuck inside. Did you have that experience, Andrew? Or do you have that experience still?
Yeah, when I was a kid, we had the real tree and the smell.
They were never really fancy trees.
They were kind of like, if you imagine one step up from Charlie Brown's Christmas tree,
that's probably what we were looking at.
But it did have that smell to it.
Nowadays, our kids don't get that luxury because we've just got the plastic tree,
the big W plastic tree.
And perfect timing because just this morning, my wife, Hannah said to me,
we need to get the tree down and put it, you know, put it together again.
And that's, that's bad news for me. I do not like dealing with the tree.
It feels, I said to her, didn't we just do that?
It was literally a year ago,
maybe two months ago that I took down that tree branch by branch.
I need to interrupt briefly though,
because I think we may need to clarify something. Jason,
when Andrew said the Big W Christmas tree, did you imagine a Christmas in the tree in the shape of a W?
No, I just imagined that it was a fake tree that he got from the local Woolies.
Oh, OK.
There you go.
Is that right?
Big W is different to Woolies.
But owned by Woolies, isn't it? Same company.
That's at one point. I don't know. Is it still? I don't know.
Maybe. But I just wanted to clarify that because I can imagine all these Northern
Hemisphere listeners going, "My God, Australian trees are in the shape of a W?"
Well, yeah, for WA, that's like how self-indulged they are.
They're like, "Everything must be either a W or an A or both."
Well, the one thing I wish we didn't have to do is a tree.
Well, why can't we just have the tree somehow maintain--
Like, I want to find a way, either a pop-up tree, like an umbrella,
and you pop it up and then just it's all decorated.
Or if we're having to do the tree that we've got now,
is there some way that I can just like wrap plastic around it or something,
And then 11 months time, just snip, scissor snip the plastic off it and boom, the tree's back.
I mean, if anybody's into tradition, clearly it's you.
You're really, really loving the thought and the exercise of putting the tree up.
It sounds like your favorite thing.
It's repetitive labor.
Why would we keep doing this to ourselves?
It should be an efficiency process we can apply to it.
Ah, okay.
Yeah, we should probably just maximize efficiency on all our holidays and just,
Why don't we just stick them all at the beginning of the year, honestly, January 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th,
let's just bang out all the holidays, eight days done, get it out of the way.
I mean, just make Christmas Day an hour.
I mean, why does it have to be a full day?
That's ridiculous.
Christmas hour.
Just shut up.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah. Give them 15 minutes.
What do you need more than that?
So, and putting up that tree that clearly no one likes to do.
Right. So, so it's still like the, the, the triangle pine tree looking tree though.
Right. Like that's still.
That's the look.
- So are there Christmas tree farms,
I guess you would call it there?
- Yep.
- Okay, so that's still a thing.
- Yeah, there was a tradition when I was a kid,
at least within our family, we would go down,
this is my sister and I, would go down with our mom
to like the suburb just down from us,
and there would be this part of a car park
that would be covered in all of those trees
that you could select from,
and we would find the real one that we wanted,
go home, bring that smell into the house and decorate it.
- Got it, okay.
Okay good so trees still exist so I assume by extension Christmas tree lights still a thing house lights did you do outside of the house.
House lights got ridiculous over the last few years.
Okay you guys are into that competition thing going on.
Whole streets will get together and elaborately decorate.
It's ridiculous.
I'm here yeah and this is where I'm not quite the same with Andrew with the efficiency aspect but I'm regarded as a bit of a Grinch when it comes to Christmas particularly by Natasha because.
I'm not surprised that both of you are in this can't like of course you are obvious.
No, I love Christmas as an event to get together and see family and presents and stuff are fine, but it's this
No, it's just this like Andrew said about lights getting ridiculous
It's everything gets bigger and more over-the-top constantly and I just think
You know, I mean, I'm not personally very religious
But you know, I look at the things and I go is it about Jesus or is it about something else?
Is it about the sales? I don't know. I just feel it's getting increasingly consumerist. That's my Grinchy aspect
Yeah, anyway, your next question, Jason.
Uh, okay.
So I'm going to step away from the religious or not aspect of the whole topic and keep it abstract.
Um, something, so I'm talking about snow earlier.
I'm curious if, let's say you go and you get something to decorate the outside of your house,
like a Santa and a sleigh kind of thing, or you get some greeting cards.
Are there predominantly still snow themed Christmas things there when that makes
absolutely no sense at all? Or did they put him in a sleigh in sand or something?
They typically do things like that because, as I said, Australians, at least Anglo-Australians,
typically hold onto this older heritage or Northern Hemispherean idea. It's either Santa
in a snow context or adapting Santa for very bizarre, warm Australian conditions. So suddenly
you'll see like on Aldi commercials here, Santa's surfing, but still in full attire,
maybe just with shorts, even though he's being baked in the sun. So, and then you hear like,
you know, jingle bells being adapted with Australian lyrics and they've got, you know,
things and references to kangaroos and you kind of go, why? Why is this happening? Which is, I mean,
I suppose it still makes sense because even a lot of other migrant groups who came here
during the post-war period have Christmas affiliations or memories in their own cultures,
so it makes sense that there's this northern angle, but I still find it funny that we haven't
really adapted for a more southern thing. What do you reckon, Andrew?
I wholeheartedly agree. It's just the same tropes, but they summarise it. Usually as well, Santa's
board shorts, if he's wearing board shorts, will often have maybe pictures of Santa on
them surfing.
You know, so it's kind of the multiple depths.
They really go all out on localizing Santa.
But it's always, it's a simplified expression of Australia because it's either surfing or
it's at the beach.
Now I'm Australian.
I've never surfed.
I have no desire to surf.
I don't really like the beach, there's too much sand.
Um, so that, that, that Santa doesn't speak to me.
Not my Santa.
Summer vacation came to mind, which is the opposite, right?
Where we're full on winter Christmas, now you're summer Christmas.
So your summer vacation for us, I'm assuming school-wise things relatively
line up in terms of breaks and so forth.
So you're actually more of like a winter vacation from school, or is that not true?
Not true.
We're all summer.
Kids get three months off in summer.
Something ridiculous, something way too long.
Something as a parent I have to deal with.
Yeah, it breaks a week or two before Christmas, and then they go
back at the beginning of February.
And that's when school kids change to a new year.
You know, they go up, up a year.
So everybody graduates their current year at the end of the year.
and move forward.
- I remember finding it absolutely bizarre as a kid
when I found out, I think it was in primary school,
when I found out that Americans
or other people in the Northern Hemisphere
had a school year over two years.
And I went, that just sounds like the most ludicrous thing
because to me it was like, you start, let's say year four
or fourth grade or whatever.
And then you were in the fourth grade for that year
and then you moved to the fifth one.
And then it was in that year,
but the idea that it was like, I don't know,
2002/03 or something like that. What the hell is that? So I found that really, really weird
that you would have a holiday in the middle of the year.
But then they can... Americans manage that, but they can't manage like a financial year running
from July to June. Like they're corporations, don't they generally run January to December
for a financial year? This is the business speaking. This is the business speaking here.
Fiscal year. We like to call that fiscal years.
Is there no standardized agreed approach?
Nope. No, you pick, I think you basically pick on what best fits you cheating on taxes as much
as possible. Okay. Okay. Well, that is officially what we could do in Australia too. Any company is
free to choose its own fiscal year, but if you actually choose anything other than July to June,
you're basically an idiot company and it will get no respect.
Yeah. I think a lot of times here, if you're like a startup type company that's brand new and just
can't understand how that works, you're like, yeah, January to December, obviously. But if you're a
more, you know, you have a lot more money to hide and shift around the world, then you do weird
things like we're going to do August is the beginning of our fiscal year. It's like, do you
have those stupid Officeworks ads where kind of like in Mean Girls where they try to make fetch
happen, they try to make that happy year for your what you say, you know, where they say happy end
of financial year is like, and every year they're like, officeworks stop trying to make the end of
financial year like as a holiday happen. Do you have that? Oh right, where you're supposed to
buy a bunch of crap so you can like write it off or whatever. Yeah, because it's like, oh officeworks,
we sell things for offices and now the people in offices can have a holiday where they, it's like
they're trying to make Black Friday but. You can buy a Brother printer on you know, June 30 and
And write it off on July 1.
Woohoo!
Happy Eofy or whatever that is.
I don't even know how to spell that.
That is not the show title because that doesn't even work.
Well, it's like E-O-F-Y, but they try to say it like a word, Eofy or something.
To bring that back to Santa and Christmas, I just want to know if Santa really should be running.
He should be running a July to June financial year as well, because the amount of revenue recognition he'd be getting in the end of the financial year, you know, in that
November December period if you're cutting off your year at that point
There's a whole bunch of revenue you probably don't have time to recognize because it's still flooding through you still settling your books
he he should definitely be a
July to June guy
Financial year I would suggest yeah, I mean can you imagine that year-over-year growth?
Well, he's basically an operations specialist. He's like the bearded Tim Cook running the magical supply chain
Quick apology to the winner of our crocodile Dundee live watch
contest winner
They have not received their prize yet. I'm aware of this. I'm sure they are painfully aware of this but
Good news
The prize is in hands in my hands. So now I just have to ship it. So it's coming
Gabby the winner
It's on its way. I swear we are not liars. We do actually have prizes for these contests. So it's gonna be here very soon
one prime plus
Yes, we have another contest we had the
the omg lol contest
- I think that's how that's how he pronounces it right omg lol. I think that's what he said. So those have been
carefully
curated and calculated for the winners. So I will be emailing, uh, wait,
will I be emailing them? Hmm. I don't think I have everyone's email.
I will be contacting you in the means that you provided your answer
to, to have you somehow contact me back so that I can
give you your code for your Omgalul one year account.
And while we're on the topic of recaps, et cetera,
I want to thank everyone who submitted an entry
for our Nostalgic November.
That was really lovely.
A combination of little photo grabs,
lovely extended stories as well.
And we'll include a link in the show notes
to our blog, which collects all these stories.
Really nice.
And not just technological stuff either.
So thanks to everyone who participated.
- That obviously, I just had a good idea.
So if November was Nostalgic November,
so we themed that one,
We need a theme for December.
Gift-giving Christmas December.
What do you reckon?
- Ooh, that really just, that's concise,
really concise and gets to the point.
I like it.
- Happy GGCD month.
- Mm, GGCD month.
- Good, good, good.
Yeah, happy good, good, good to everyone.
- GGCD, what was it?
GGCD?
- Yeah.
Giving Christmas December.
That is one of the worst names we've ever come up with.
I love it.
We're going with it.
All right.
GGCD it is.
What do you do?
So, but what do we do for GGCD?
This has to be a thing now.
You have to give a gift to someone that needs it or something.
There's gotta be some kind of giving something.
Oh, I hadn't really thought that that far through.
Okay, so is the idea that we're donating food, gifts or any other useful items to those who
are less advantaged and then sharing that particular thing with other people so they
know who they can give things to.
Is that the kind of very bizarre premise that we're coming up with here?
We're actually donating?
If you insist on explaining it in a way that people will understand, then yes.
Is that what you're going for, Andrew?
Were you going for something more capitalist or more socially minded?
It's official!
G G C D B F Q Z Y.
Give food/goods that people need to people that need them.
Done.
And feel free to share your goodness with everyone else so they know where you donated.
We'll do the same.
Hates trees, loves people.
Hey guys, guess what I did last night?
What did you do?
I went to explosive pro wrestling.
That sounds dangerous.
It was it was reawakening 20.
Can you give us a little more about that?
Because what does that mean?
You're all familiar with WWF / WWE.
I'm sure.
Oh, the World Wildlife Fund.
Yeah, that's a good organization.
That's that's why it became WWE.
This is the Perth version of that.
Oh, obviously.
It is sensational.
It is so good.
Is this like backyard wrestling?
It's backyard but it's legit.
It's professional.
Oh, okay.
It's held for the Perth locals.
They have an event every couple of months at the Claremont Showgrounds, Gate 1.
I encourage you to get along at some point in the future if you can because it is sensational.
The final match last night was to decide the new champion.
It was Mad Mikey Nichols up against Julian Ward, local free metal boy.
He done good.
That was the name he came up with?
Was just his name?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sometimes you just got to go with the classics.
It was an epic match.
It was one of those matches, basically it was a no holds barred, free for all.
So accoutrements were used.
There was a trash can or as we would call it a rubbish bin.
A bin?
There was a cricket bat.
Ooh.
Which, so imagine a rubbish bin placed over the head of another person and a cricket bat
smashed into that rubbish bin.
It was good.
Like a metal one, right?
Yeah.
Like a proper, yeah.
So it was real loud.
So yeah, real loud.
So do these characters, I mean, or these wrestlers, do they have-
Whoa, whoa, characters implies that this is not a thing.
Well, that's why I was rewording. Do these wrestlers adopt a particular persona or character, or is it just some guy who, you know, finished work and popped up and smashed someone in the head with a cricket bat?
No, they generally, um, they do, they all do have personalities, characters of their own. Yeah. If they're creation, um, some are better than others, but some of the wrestling, I don't want to like belittle it.
but these guys are really good.
Some of the people that are wrestling,
it is top shelf, high quality wrestling,
really, really talented people,
fit as, a lot of time spent in the gym,
and they can move and they can do this.
It is really, really impressive.
I've been going to this for probably three years.
I've been a pretty good--
- I remember you going last year with Benji, I think.
- Yeah, our kids love it.
They absolutely love it.
Although for the last few months,
Benji's been saying to me,
Dad, when I grow up, I'm going to be a wrestler. That's fine. Halfway through the main event of last night, probably after thumbtacks, you know, those metal thumbtacks you put on a pinup board.
Don't like that.
Drawing pins.
Yeah. After somebody was body slammed into some of those, Benji turned to me and said, Dad, I don't want to be a wrestler anymore.
Wise choice.
Sensible kid.
Yeah.
Pretty clever.
So no spoilers, but who's the new champ?
New champ Julian Ward. He snatched the belt from Mikey Nichols in an epic performance.
Really great from both guys. Huge match. It's like quite painful, quite violent. They're usually not
that violent, but this one was. Sometimes you need that in wrestling, especially this is their main
event for the year. So they really stepped it up a notch. - Yeah, you gotta bloody it up, make the
people want to come back. - Yeah, usually like other matches, just really good technical wrestling.
Big shout out to Gavin McGavin.
Sure.
The real wrestler.
Epic, epic wrestler.
So are there any, are there any videos online or photos that you can share that we can put in the show notes so people can get a feel for this?
Look, it is licensed content, so I'm not sure I can share, but they have a Twitter account, EPW Perth or something.
The event was Reawakening number 20.
It was, you'll find them on socials.
They've got a website, EPW Perth, I think it is.
I'm getting nothing for this.
They don't know I exist, but I know they do.
Was the Undertaker there?
The Undertaker?
Yeah.
No, he wasn't there.
Um, but the world beater Damien Slater was.
Hmm.
Yeah.
He, he, he spent some time in the WWE world for a while, a number of years ago.
I would really like these people to workshop some names, I think, is
what I'm taking away from this.
Well, my favourite wrestler who's been on there, I'm not sure he's still active,
whether he's just having a break.
But gorgeous Gary, gorgeous Gary.
See, there you go.
That's see, he's got, he's got the, yeah, that's what I'm looking for.
More than just like, hey, I'm Todd Anderson.
It's like, okay.
Well, at least do some Spoonerisms, like take their real name and just swap the two
initials and you get some great results.
Something like Julian Moore or Julian Jord.
I don't know. It just sounds more interesting.
There you go.
Doesn't make any sense but it's like all woolly and jord that sounds pretty good so I might be able to include a couple of photos that I started to shoot they took I don't know I took just a couple of photos last night I might be able to put them in the show that somewhere but what I'm saying is people people wrestling is very divisive.
People say oh it's fake it's that no it's scripted but let's see you get body slammed off a top rope.
onto a canvas and see if it hurts and then tell me how fake it actually is this is an athletic performance.
I think that's right it's a performance that happens to be very athletic.
So get around it Perth people EPW EPW.
Now back to schedule normally schedule content I have information about when you are my iMac and an iMessages bug.
Something technological wow go for it.
Glad you fixed your computer finally Jason made me do it Martin.
Yeah cuz his computer was messed up his tech support is tech support was.
Format the whole thing and start over again.
Did that work no I guess.
What was the issue in the first place or the numerous issues what will I can you describe it Jason I don't even know where to start markdown double brackets.
There's a certain kind of person in the technology world that feels that they need to a try everything that's ever been done in the entire world.
Be must modify slash change everything that exists within the system and then see somehow expects that all to just work still.
when there's no possible way that it could.
So that's the situation that our friend got himself into
by doing probably about 11 years now worth of
little tweaks and modifications that he's seen
in random message boards and Reddit threads and so forth.
It seemed like great ideas at the time,
didn't need 'em at all, but they were there,
so let's do 'em.
when you start typing things into the terminal,
copy and paste style,
no clue what they're doing. - I was gonna ask
if terminal featured.
- Oh, had to be, had to be so much terminal copy and paste.
Where you hit enter, seemingly nothing happens,
but horrible things are happening in the background.
- What does defaults right mean anyway?
(laughing)
- There you go.
So then we get into a situation where our unnamed friend
is attempting to do something very basic with Markdown,
which was making Markdown link to an image
within what application you ask?
His normal note application?
No, some other random thing he found on the internet
that he decided to incorporate into his life.
So he starts typing these--
- Bolted onto the other note taker.
- Yes, bolted on.
Yep, that's a good way to put it.
Band-aided, band-aided on maybe, something like that.
Bluetact, so he's in this thing creating who knows what.
I don't know.
I don't even still understand what it was,
but it was creating markdown links that were somehow,
so everyone, not everyone, people that use markdown know
markdown links for an image,
you got your exclamation point,
you got your brackets with your words for the image,
your other parens there with the link.
It was repopulating the first bracketed section twice
in a row between what the plain text was
and what it was being rendered as.
Yeah, that makes sense, right?
You're thinking, that's not how that works.
It's just plain text.
How could plain text be duplicating itself
randomly in another place?
I can tell you, because you've done 11 years worth
of weird markdown interactions and magic to your system.
So the only solution is to just burn it to the ground.
Start over from your iMac that's been carried over for the last six computers
and just start over.
Because when I did what he was attempting to do, did it work?
- Perfectly.
- Of course it did.
Because it's just a normal system.
So he burned it to the ground and now it works fine.
- Except for that one bug which still features.
What bug is that?
Oh, that's called, it's pronounced BB edit, not bug.
So he uses BB edit, which has probably been hacked to bits over the last 15 years as well,
because it's extensible.
And now it doesn't render text properly.
He creates markdown files.
Are they dot MDs?
No, they're not.
It's not BB edit's fault.
I think it's Marked's fault.
my friend Brett Terpstra I think there may be a bug.
Oh right.
It's a like a renderer thingy for Markdown files.
Is it like M A R key day?
Key day.
See now I'm even,
can't even spell or say words properly or letters.
M A R K D apostrophe S Markts.
Is that what you're doing?
You've completely thrown me for a six there.
No,
no,
no.
I was trying,
I was trying to pluralize the name of the app.
So I was trying to say it was possessive.
I was trying to say it's Markts fault.
So the app is called Markt.
Mark. M-A-R-K-E-D. Yeah, like I said apostrophe S. Mark's fault. Yes, but no, not Mark. Marked.
Who's Mark? Yeah, I said a D, but then I stuffed up the letters. Anyway, I've thrown you off now.
But now Jason's saying Mark. It's Marked. Who's Mark? I don't think Mark has anything to do with this bit. It's Marked by Brett.
This is high quality discussion.
Anyway, anyway, the upshot is I have my iMac.
It's so fast.
It's flying now.
Intel iMac and it just, you should see how fast this thing boots. It's ridiculous. I didn't realize
I could go that fast. And all's well except for now I found another bug. - iMessage. - Right.
I'm looking at it right now. I'm looking at Hamsterview's chat. - Tell me. - And it says,
"Two people updated contact information. Jason, Martin." And there's a button that says "View."
Okay, I'm going to click view because I'm curious about that.
And I get a little pop-up, drop-down pop-up thing.
New photo available from Jason.
New photo available from Martin.
There's two separate dialogues in this one pop-up.
I can either ignore or update contact.
The update contact is in a drop-down, you know, the little blue arrow next to it.
So I think, oh, so I can update contact or I can do something else.
I'll click that blue arrow to see. No, I can't. It's unclickable. Okay. Hmm. Can't.
All right. So maybe I just click on update contact button rather than the
drop-down area. Sure. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. But I want the new photo from
Jason and Martin. I would recommend upgrading to an M-series computer. I feel
Upgrade to Windows at this point this is ridiculous whoa upgrading to Windows is not a sentence that makes any sense think that's a thing
Okay, so I want I want Jason's
Photo we don't have it it looks like a GQ magazine cover right you know we know the one I
Know the one but I'm gonna click for the purpose of this show. I'm gonna click ignore. I have not done this yet
Okay, somehow I have to get this photo. I ignore ah
Oh, oh, fixed.
It thought for me, then it went away.
And now I've still got a new photo available from Martin.
The dropdown area is still twice as big as it needs to be
because I'll try and upload Martin.
- Why don't you just try uploading photos
that you want, right?
And then maybe the actual dialogue box will work
and then replace the thing that you put there
with the thing that it wants to put there.
- I don't know, but you know what?
I've got your new photos in iMessage.
- There you go.
- So we actually resolved it by talking through this.
Is that right?
- It's been resolved.
- There we go.
So you don't need to buy an M1 series computer.
- You're welcome iMessage developers.
We solved the feedback issue.
- Wow.
- I'm gonna put a new photo into my iMessage contact now.
- I might install a sticker pack.
All right, that's me done.
I'm out.
(upbeat music)
- I wanna ask Andrew about the drink bottle
that he's flashed up more than once.
A4, A5.
Can I just ask, are you drinking from part of an aquarium or a fish tank?
Because that's what it looks like.
It does look that way, doesn't it?
It's a rectangular prism with a little knob on the end.
This is, it's a, it's a memo bottle or memo bottle, depending on where you come from.
It comes in various sizes.
I know this because my wife has an A6, I guess it would be.
It has it printed on it, A5, and you can get various sizes.
All right, I was the ignorant one here. I just keep seeing this rectangle
pop up with water in it.
It's thin. It's thin, so you can slip it into your briefcase.
Right, because everyone, you know, briefcase.
Exactly.
Samsonite.
Yeah. He puts it in his, what are they, day planner.
So, after I've done my skedpal, I can pull out and have a sip of water.
And it's quite lovely. And I will say that the in environmental corner, this company who make it, be corporation certified. So it may just look like a plastic bottle, whatever that means. Apparently, it's good for the environment.
So you're talking about bees as in pollinators?
What's a bee? What's a bee? Is that like a corporation run by bees?
Yeah, yeah, it is. Yep. Yep. That's right. Honey, honey central.
Not those murder hornets though, right? These are like normal nice peas.
No, don't like those.
They're not good.
It's a good water bottle. I endorse it.
I'll see if I can dig out a referral code and see if I can do that.
Perfect. And if you can actually show us a picture and put in the show notes of that
bottle inside one of your briefcases and how it fits, that would be great.
OK, I can make that happen.
Is it a day planner? What was the thing that everybody was big on years and years ago?
Is it called a day planner? I can't think of the name now.
You mean like the organizers?
Yeah.
Like in Seinfeld when Elaine gets one and it malfunctions and the Russian writer throws
it out the window.
Maybe it's file effects. That could be it. Yeah.
But that's what these bottles would fit in. I feel like you would fit that in one of those
somehow and it would be...
Oh, you're talking about a bag or a case. I was thinking about those little devices that you...
Oh, no, it's like a big leather, like crazy book that's got all the stupid, you know, calendar and it's your phone in paper.
It might have a little calculator built into it.
Yeah, embedded in it.
So, yep.
But it's solar.
Yes.
So, it's questionable.
Yep.
Andrew, when you're out and about consulting and keeping Perth running, do you carry one of those with you?
No, I don't. Although I have to admit that in my younger days, I may have had a folio much like Jason just outlined.
I am not surprised.
You were so- You wanted one of those for the longest time, I bet.
And then when you finally got one, so excited.
I wanted- I remember getting-
Color matched with your pocket protector?
Making up calendar events that weren't even real, just so you could pencil them in.
When I was- I think when I was in high school.
I think I bought myself an actual like not the a4 ones, but the smaller ones the sort of
purse size ones that would have yeah for the everyman on the go
Yeah, and it would have removable sort of paper and it was refillable so you could buy refill packs
And it was kind of like had six or seven
Six ring binder thing. Yeah. Yeah, and you clip it open put some sheets in but closed keep track of your days
Yeah, I bought myself one of those as a student
Course you did. High school. You gotta keep, how else are you gonna know your schedule? Seriously, how did I not get beaten up more often? So lucky that I could play basketball.
You were using it as a shield, that's why. Yeah.
Basketball was like my school defense system.
So people look at you and go, who's this nerd carrying a file effects or whatever it was? And you're going, no, that's our center forward. That's right. I don't know. I was literally, if you've ever seen White Man Can't Jump, and it was like, yeah, we'll take the chump.
I was said chump Billy Hoyle.
You've made a reference before we didn't react I remember you're very heartbroken we've just done it again so it's twice.
Well no I acknowledge the reference and how we didn't.
It'll happen a third time.
What a chump.
Oh Billy.
Oh god someone get that Nick tan tan tan tan tan tan tan tan tan.
Until enjoy it and I caught up with Nick tan in person.
Big thanks to Nathan.
I am he was really really really hospitable great to see him it's hemisphere abuse bringing people together.
We bring a lot of people together I think more than you would expect.
Weather because they meet through this or because they can't stand listen so they go seek out other people to talk to one where the another were driving people together.
So if you're in willing gone seek out mine.
I don't know if I can vouch for that that seems a little stalker ish you find him in the library.
Perhaps or in a.
It's normally just hanging around the general nonfiction section looking to strike a strike up conversation with people who didn't want it.
It's like, oh, I see you.
Or the newspaper section.
He's big on the newspaper section.
He's always over there rifling through newsprint.
Nostalgically through the old Good Weekend magazines from the Sydney Morning Herald.
He'll have the little gloves on, the little rubber gloves, so he doesn't get the newsprint
on his fingers.
That'll be him.
So just look for that guy.
Although to be fair, I mean, you say, you know, you'll find Martin walking around Mullingong.
When I first met Natasha, we'd be walking around, you know, we'd go to a cafe or something,
through the CBD or down by the beach or whatever and people would say "Oh, how you going Martin?"
and then we'd just strike up conversation and we'd walk away and she'd go "Why does everyone know you?
How is this going on?" and I think it was kind of a symptom of being someone who was like the high
school captain guy so I was constantly up in front of people like in a school context and then I'd go
and do stuff at other schools and I kind of did drama and stuff and it's not like I knew everyone
Not everyone in Wollongong knows who Martin Felder is. I don't know how much of a thing they know.
It was enough people that she went, "How the hell does everyone know you?" And it was kind of this bizarre case of minor celebrity status because there'd be people who said hello to me.
And I didn't actually remember who they were because I was the one up behind a lectern or performing or something like, "There's that Martin guy." And I'm like, "Hello, person."
And just as a reference, Martin's down playing this. I spoke with somebody that I work with.
And he's he's he's in will go and he's in Martin.
How do you say where are the one degree of separation before we even doing this show because i know god who knows who's in will go who knows my son.
I was walking around downtown portland the other day and somebody stop me was like hey you're that guy that knows martin i was like that's me.
You bet. It was uncanny. I couldn't believe it. It was crazy.
Well, look, next time you're walking down the beach, said person listening to this podcast, and you happen to be by the Ted Tobin OAM Observation Deck, looking over City Beach and Flagstaff Hill, maybe we'll, you know, share a coffee and have some takeaway chips and fend off the seagulls.
It would be great.
And if you're in Portland, nobody approach Jason.
He is an Android. - Do not approach me.
- His self-defense systems will kick in and you may die.
- And for those who don't know what we're talking about,
if you aren't a subscriber to One Prime Plus, go and have a look
because probably one of our most favorite episodes we've ever done,
we discovered that Jason is in fact some form of replicant or Android
looking at preteen photos.
Thank you, David H for submitting that question.
I thought that was a lot of fun.
