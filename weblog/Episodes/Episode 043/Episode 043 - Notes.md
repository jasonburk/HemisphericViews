What even is an “EOFY”?! Andrew is trying life as a mad man and we talk about how the hemispheres change the Christmas holiday season. Meanwhile, Jason fixes Andrew’s computer and doesn’t get thanked and Martin also gets thrown for a six. Don’t worry though, he is going to pull through!

Also, thank you to the Hemisphereans who submitted their memories to us for Nostalgic November! [Read the collection on our blog.](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/articles/nostalgic-november-hemisphereans)
