- So episode one, the engagement.
- The engagement.
- Man, those classic title slides.
You just don't get TV with that,
those sort of slides anymore, do you?
- No, no.
And for anyone who's not already a fan,
We're bringing to you the action-packed series,
The Golden Girls from 1985.
So little ways back.
It's just, it's a laugh a minute as noted by the laugh track,
which do we still have laugh tracks?
Is that still a thing?
- No, I don't think so.
Unless it's done ironically, intentionally and ironically.
- This was like, somebody just was leaning on the button
for laugh track and it was just it felt like it was going the whole time.
Because it didn't say at the end,
this was filmed in front of a live studio audience.
No, I don't think there was anything live about this.
It, the thing that struck me, it just immediately looked like a stage play.
You know, it was very open set, you know, the sort of the exits to the left or the
right.
And I don't know if it's just because we're watching this in quote unquote high
definition now. Like it wasn't recorded like that. But you know,
it just the fact that these old shows are now kind of put on to new medium,
you sort of see things that I don't think you used to see back in the eighties
and my gosh, everything looked so incredibly fake.
All the plants could not look more fake.
Like the furniture barely looked like it was real.
Just nothing on the set looked at all like it was it was real it was very weird.
But my first thought is who's this guy in the apartment and then what happened to him because I don't remember that guy.
No no.
But he was like a main guy.
He was there right so we're in S1E1.
Yeah.
Where he's just he randomly is just there we're we're expected to just understand that he's there.
Like there's no explanation whatsoever. He's cooking them food as if he's like some kind of house
keeper slash like like a man living
something
And they're all like they're all
older women
Living together because they can't afford to live separately yet. They have this like live-in
like chef
But then I don't believe to your point
He exists after S1E1.
Like I think he's, that's it.
I don't think we ever see him again.
- I don't think so.
I think it's just, they realized that he was superfluous.
And just don't even mention that he's gone.
Just entirely eliminate him.
- So, so weird.
Like you would think it would take, I don't know,
a season or a couple of episodes
to maybe kill off a character or something.
Like, no, first one didn't, didn't work.
We're getting rid of him.
He's gone.
And then Rose hits us with another quote.
Hope he doesn't have hair in his ears.
Which is a big laugh, big laugh, right?
No laughs in the Canyon household because suddenly I realized
that Rose is describing me.
Well, maybe not me because I now I'm the proud owner of hair in my ears.
I'm sure she didn't mean it in that way toward you, but in 1985, you didn't.
So that's true.
So it was hilarious in 1985, 1985.
It's like a conversion rate of money.
Like in 1985, funny it was, it landed, but now with inflation of laughter, it
just, it didn't land as much.
Yeah.
What about the shoulder pads?
Like I forgot how incredibly shoulder paddy the eighties were.
It was just shoulder pad upon shoulder pad upon shoulder pad.
I've heard everyone, all of them didn't matter who you are.
It was massive.
Wasn't it?
I mean, Dorothy was certainly rocking and she was a large, large as in tall.
I don't think she really needed shoulder pads, but she certainly went with them.
She did.
And she, she, she owned it for sure.
Um, you have to bring this part up.
So you have Sophia, the oldest of the group,
who right out of the gate,
you're pretty sure is gonna be pretty problematic
in terms of being a character.
And there was at one point,
I can't remember exactly how this came up,
but it was very clear to me looking back
that there was a moment where they said
that she like had a stroke or something.
So she didn't know what she was saying.
And that very much to me felt like a cover for like, she's going to let something
slip at some point that is really not okay.
So we're just going to try to head that off now and blame it on a medical
condition. It's like, Oh yeah, that's definitely going to happen.
I can see that for sure.
She did let out a bit of casual racism and I wasn't sure if
that was, was that, is that just 1985 or is that, you know,
brain stroke impacted Sophia.
Well, and it's all taking place in Florida. So looking at Florida in 2023,
maybe this was a kind of a sign of things to come. We're not sure.
I have to ask you, like, who was the audience for this?
Like in 1985, I was not watching this in 1985.
I did not see it till, you know, some years later.
In syndication.
I'm not sure who would be the target audience for something like this.
Would it be just your casual, because I figured like in the eighties you had,
you know, they're thinking back to the shows in the eighties.
I'm not sure who this was really for.
Yeah.
I don't know if it was, I think it was for everybody because it wasn't TV back
then it was event TV.
So it was, it didn't matter.
7.30 or eight o'clock or whatever the time slot was.
That was your, you probably had two back to back sitcoms or something.
And this was one of those, you'd had the Cosby show and then this.
Yeah.
That's true.
And everybody just sat down and watched whatever was on Tuesday night, Tuesday
night, comedy night, you sit down and watch this.
Didn't matter.
Cause there was only four things.
Yeah.
That's true.
Yeah.
Trying to look at it through a lens of today where you're like, have these
like micro dissections of, of, of viewing audiences.
Like that wasn't a thing in the eighties.
It was like, there's eight shows.
You watch them all because you're just glad you have TV to begin with.
Like end of story.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thursday night's action night.
You watch a bit of the A-Team and yeah.
Yeah.
Duke's a hazard, but Tuesday's comedy with, with the Golden Girls.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
So we're going to, we're going to keep, we're going to keep these short.
because there's like 7,000 episodes.
- There are a lot of episodes.
- But we have to land on,
we have to always end with the golden gag.
That's like the thing that happened.
It's just like the one thing that stuck out
where you're like, okay guys, I see what you're doing there.
And I'm gonna go out on a limb and just assume
that we're gonna probably pick the same one for this.
But I could be wrong.
So I'll give you the honors to go ahead and go first.
- Okay, thank you, Jason.
my golden gag is the mirror death check on Sophia as the site gag.
It's the one. Cause you, you knew it was coming and it happened and you still laughed right along with the laugh track
because it was like, she's so incredibly old.
We constantly just think she's dead always, even though she's just sleeping.
That was definitely the golden gag of Golden Girls. S1, E1, the engagement.
Do you know what happens next?
I don't.
We have S1, E2. Guess who's coming to the wedding?
Oh, geez. I don't know, but I bet we will find out as well as the rest of our
massive Golden Girls audience. Thanks all.
[Music]
We got business corner.
Business corner?
Alright, I don't know if I have my tax person available but let's get into it anyway.
Have you got your tie? Can you jump over and grab your tie out of the cupboard?
out of the cupboard. Oh, can we just pretend like I have one? Sure, you're wearing an orange shirt.
Yeah. It's kind of Thai-ish or as you would say orange. Orange. So Jason, it's an important
question. Look, we've known or the financial industry knew some time ago that there was
going to be an explosion in a new asset class and that it was going to create value out of thin air.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And so I'm really just taking this moment to respect the wisdom of those
financial boffins. And I was just wondering how your Bitcoin and NFT investments going these days.
That's a really good question. My NFT investments are non-existent. So those are going very well
because I invested zero and they're still worth zero. So that one's actually pretty good.
Bitcoin on the other hand, a little bit of a different story.
Um, I saw this in the notes.
So I thought, Hmm, I haven't checked on that in a while.
I should probably go look.
That's why not.
Well, it's good.
It's good that you haven't been checking it closely.
Cause they do say with long-term investments, don't check every, just
put it away, forget it's there.
Then check in because long-term compounding that's your friend.
Yeah.
Yep.
Yep.
especially with something as stable as fake currency.
- Completely.
- You wanna just let that ride.
So a little bit of background on my crypto portfolio,
if you will.
I got, let's see, so I have a bunch of different ones
and most of them were free.
I just kind of got them.
- I like that you've diversified your portfolio.
So that's a good start too.
- Yeah, it's diversified.
There's probably like 30 different coin thingies in there.
But I had like the, the stellar, was it stellar coin or something?
Stellar lumens.
Lumens. Yeah. And then I just, I got a bunch of those for free for some reason.
I don't remember why, but okay.
I know exactly why you got them because I got them too.
Oh, why did we get those?
It was for that, um, that privacy chat app, um,
kind of that files and chat app thing.
- Yeah, that's right.
And then they like stopped doing it altogether.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, standard Bitcoin kind of thing.
And then I bought Bitcoin from a vending machine in Canada,
like back when Bitcoin first started.
- Hmm, okay.
- 'Cause it was like, ooh, there's a vending machine.
And we happened to be in Canada at that time
where there was like the first Bitcoin vending machine
or whatever.
And we're like, oh, that's cool.
Let's go do that.
So I got some from that.
Um, I was trying to do the whole like mining thing for a while just cause it
was, I don't know, it was something interesting and I got some, I got, you
know, a bunch of Bitcoin from that, from, from mining, quote unquote.
So bottom line is I got a bunch of coin crap for free from various sources.
And, um, I'll cut right to the, to the, to the punchline here at the height of
all of the various coined thingies that I had,
the total value was $79,628.58.
So-- - That's no chump change.
- That's pretty good.
That's a pretty good return on zero.
I like that.
- Yeah, for sure. - So as you do,
you think, I'm gonna let that sit,
I'm gonna let that cook a little bit,
as they say in the financial industry.
And I'm happy to report as of today,
about 20 minutes ago when I checked,
it's now worth $1,761.92.
So pretty good return, really.
- Still starting from zero.
- Still in the black.
- Yeah, it's not red.
So that's good, I think.
- Past performance is no indicator of future performance.
- Future performance.
From your professional spreadsheet knowledge,
is that good to go from the 79,000 to the 1,000?
Is that?
- I don't like to talk financial matters
in terms of good or bad.
- Okay.
- It's more about deltas and variances.
So what you've had is you've had it you've had you've been impacted by by a negative Delta.
Okay is this an economic headwind that I'm facing right now.
Most definitely yes economic headwinds are they're just blowing through like a storm through the bitcoin realm.
Yeah I thought cuz they were coins they'd have some weight in the wind would not be able to take them but it turns out.
It was apparently the Dogecoin weren't minted quite as heavily they cheated out on their their copper.
So yes I look unfortunately so what I would say Jason you've been patient for this long.
Yeah it's time to just sit down calm down close the briefcase back up let it sit for a little longer.
Okay just a little more time there's logic to this right because at this point if you leave it longer you may lose.
Just you the most you can lose this point is one thousand seven hundred sixty one dollars and ninety two cents that's true okay so if you lost if you like if I if I took two thousand dollars from you right now would you like to go on.
Yes so you can cover that there is absolutely zero benefit from worrying or panicking.
You've got one you've got that money just let it sit there and you never know one day it might grow and become seventy nine thousand six hundred twenty eight dollars and fifty eight cents.
If you're at that point I would probably say withdraw and put it into a into a government backed currency of some kind.
Right mm-hmm okay, but you're not sorry you know it's good advice. No, I'm clearly not there
Well if it ever gets back to seventy nine thousand six hundred and twenty dollars and fifty eight cents I will
I'll take action
On it. Yeah, and can I just say for all our audience?
Hemisphere views is not a provider of financial advice we have no
Apra licenses we have no whatever FDIC's you need in America.
No.
Do you not turn to us for any financial legal medical spiritual advice of any kind.
No the only thing we can provide is one prime plus dot com.
It's in the long game.
That's what we can provide it's like a reverse financial institution where you give us money.
That's the only way that the money goes I hear the one prime plus.com servers have been holding up as well as the Bitcoin valuations as well.
It's questionable they have been volatile lately.
In terms of their uptime I'm not sure why but they have been also hemisphere accused.com so I think it's just it's just pure popularity you know when when you're that popular,
Amongst the the people on the internet you know a server can only accept so many connections so I think that's probably what's going on is it's just probably the the crazy.
Popularity of the show of one prime plus dot com.
Will you think about it Jason think about it so threads was able to handle a hundred million users right and stay up so clearly we have more than a hundred million people visiting that site.
That's just science I don't see how you could argue that.
A hundred million sustainable you can do that.
Yeah and we didn't even change the name of the podcast to a single letter so take that.
I tried to do the whole thing of like is overcast really the podcast app for me I'm a heavy consumer of podcasts but.
I hear a lot about apple apps being pretty good these days.
The default notes calendar I switched both of those and they've done me okay.
Okay so it's like it was try the default podcast app.
Yeah who boy Jason yeah.
Oh boy how do you actually know when you subscribe to a show in that app not a clue how do you know when the new episode is so there.
I don't I'm convinced it doesn't matter the whole point of the app is to just.
Gather new shows and it doesn't matter what you've already subscribed to it just feels like it's a vomit of random shows being shoved in my face.
And with no respect for the chronology of them it's just like hey listen to this episode right now.
What show is it it doesn't matter.
No, I don't think it matters. I don't think listening is the point of the app finding things seems to be the point of the app
yes, which is weird and
When you try to listen, it's oh, it's horrible
And then I went through the whole process of syncing up so I got I got it installed on my Mac
I got installed on my iPad my iPhone and then all of a sudden they're like downloading episodes like mad and
I'm trying to say no no to slow down
I just want the last three episodes.
You got to go set each bit, you know,
toggle the options in each app.
And then you've got to mark all the old ones as listen to,
but then what's the point?
Because you never really seem to get the cue correctly,
correct anyway.
- Yep.
- It's just a mess.
- It's very weird.
- I don't know how that's the most popular app.
I don't get it.
- I don't, I, it makes me very much question people
who are not maybe like hardcore, like tech podcast people,
right? Like, let's, let's pretend that this app is for people that are,
don't know anything about, you know,
this show or a show that's even remotely technology
focused. And they're just, I, I, I wish I could even name a name of one,
but you know, let's, let's just say there's some like, I don't know,
health fitness show or something that's like super
mainstream has a billion billion listeners
and 'cause it's on like, I don't know, NPR,
I don't know, whatever it is.
But even for that demographic,
I don't understand how like this is even acceptable
for that.
Or do people only listen to maybe one thing
or do they not even subscribe and they just open it
and say like, oh, that looks interesting and hit go?
I don't know, maybe.
Is that possible?
Yeah, it's, it feels like an entirely different type of person that it's designed for.
And I don't know that person.
I don't know who they are.
I don't know what they're doing.
It doesn't feel like podcasts.
But again, maybe that's because we're like from OG podcasting back in the day before
it was even, you know, podcasts.
It was just RSS feeds.
Maybe that's the difference is if you're, if you know what an RSS feed is, you don't
use that, you use something else.
But if you don't know what an RSS feed is, like you use something like a,
like a, um, what is that other thing that we're not on? Uh,
the green one, Spotify, Spotify, or like Stitcher,
I guess, or something or Apple podcasts. Like,
it's more like a radio where you just sort of like open it and say like,
I don't care. Just play a thing, I guess. I don't know.
I don't understand it.
I've I'm every time I try to use it, I'm super confused by it.
It doesn't show all the show notes.
So no, I'm not a fan at all.
What's the difference between a listen now and library?
Couldn't tell you.
Because if I want to listen, like to me, they're the same.
I want to listen to my library now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
I don't know.
It's weird.
And now the worst part of it is I have to somehow get this thing off all my
devices without it. So I'm going to have to, I'll delete the apps off the iPhone.
I think that will iOS, that'll be pretty easy.
But then I'm going to have to go into all the settings on the Mac side and make
sure it's not downloading episodes for all of eternity.
It will be, don't worry.
Yeah.
This is going to be fun.
And it's like, I don't even have to use it.
It's the thing that drives me nuts is that as somebody that is trying to put
out a piece of content for people to see or not see, listen to, um, it just
feels like it just feels bad.
And I don't feel like you're able to represent your, whatever you want to
call it, brand or whatever, like appropriately, it just, you're, you're
stuck and yet that's the default.
If you want to review, that's literally the only place on the internet you can
write a review for a podcast.
Podcasts are everywhere, but you can only review them in one place.
Regardless of if they use that player or not, you have to tell them to go to that
player, which is now making it look worse.
Yeah.
To write a review on the thing you want them to review, but is in a worse state.
So it's like, are they going to review it based on, I don't know.
Anyway.
Yeah.
It's not great.
So what are you going to use instead?
Because this is not the solution for you.
No, it's not the solution.
So I looked at a few other solutions.
Um, I quickly looked at, I quickly looked at Airshow, which is by feed, feed bin
people, and I liked it a lot.
It's very clean, very simple.
I thought, Oh, this could be good.
But then I saw the price and it was like, I'm not paying $36 a year.
Airshow is only for people that already have feed bin.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And if I was using feed bin, if I was using feed bin probably would, but I'm not.
So no, it's pretty though.
So I give it that.
Um, I didn't even try, I'm not even gonna try pocket gas again.
I know what that's about.
I, I find that interface inscrutable as well.
Oh, it's the best, but sure.
Go ahead.
Never figure out that UI.
I don't know what it's trying to do to me.
I still miss Castro.
Yeah.
I saw you put that in there and I was, I went and looked again and like, I
think it's still around, I'm pretty sure it got bought or something or, or.
Soul it's it's changed hands.
It's abandoned where.
Yeah, but it's gotten an update recently ish.
Okay.
But I don't know what to think of it.
I haven't seen any.
I would love a blog post from whoever owns it now to say like, here's what's going on.
They talk about the killer.
The killer feature of Castro was always meant to be the queue, right?
The inbox and everything would land in the inbox.
Then you would manually choose your queue.
I thought that was fine.
But the killer feature for me in Castro was being able to toggle on and off each
chapter.
Yeah, totally.
So what you could do is you could just go through and toggle off all the ads and
any other boring bits you didn't want.
And it would just play through the episode and skip those.
I love that feature.
That was the killer feature for sure.
Yeah.
I 100% agree.
And of course the app I'm back to using is never going to do that because it has a
vested interest in ensuring that you hear the ads as best as possible.
And that's overcast.
And I say that because the developer has a podcast that has ads.
So it would be undermining his own revenue making opportunity to do that.
Yeah, that one's weird for me.
I actually tried that one for about a month recently because the world won't shut up
about it, about how it's just the perfect app.
So I was like, all right, I got to understand what's going on here.
and I tried it for a month and I'm glad people love it,
but for me personally, I just don't understand
this like unwavering, no issues whatsoever love for it.
It's like fine, but I'm sure I'm gonna get
plenty of hate mail for this,
but I actually don't like it at all.
I, like you said, the Pocket Cast one
was just like the UI was inscrutable.
I kind of feel like that about this one.
- Okay.
- But that's why we have 50 different apps
because then you can pick which one you like.
So.
- The only thing, I think Overcast is really ugly.
Especially the newer bits that they put in
like the queuing and playlists.
That's super ugly.
The only thing I, well, the thing I like about it
is the audio playback engine.
It just somehow makes audio sound better.
And I think for me, who often listens
at slightly sped up speeds,
because Americans talk slowly.
I think that must be the issue.
Cause everybody, everybody says the audio engine is so much better.
It has to only be for you weirdos that listen past one X because for the,
the, the apps that do the like skipping of space and all that stuff.
Yep.
I think they're all the same.
I cannot tell the difference, but I listen to everything at one X.
And I have to think that this audio engine superiority thing must be for you.
Wackos that listen to like 1.5x or whatever for some reason.
Yeah, well if all you Americans could just start speaking at a normal speed instead of going so slowly.
Live in the moment.
My moment goes faster than yours.
Well, that's a southern hemisphere thing.
You're just gonna have to deal with it.
So yeah.
So you went full circle.
You're back to where you started.
Okay.
Talking about podcasts on a podcast. That's
That's when you know, you've really made it. Do you know why it's why we've had to do this
Why we're a flight once again flying in missing man formation
That's is
It does feel a little bit empty in the room
In the zoom room. Yeah, is somebody not here. I'm sure if when we were talking about default apps
We probably would have heard the love of Apple podcasts from mr. Default himself. I think that might be the one default
He doesn't use
actually
Thank you. Is this the same one as you?
It's it's if it's even too bad for Martin Feld. I'm sorry that should go right to Tim Cook
That's that should be he should be a VIP in Apple mail for Tim that just says like hey
I don't use this and they'd be like whoa
Hold the presses
Cancel the next iPhone podcast is what we need to be working on right now. Yeah. Yeah, we need to satisfy Martin field
He's not with us he is
He's in like the the strangest city in Australia
Which one's that?
WA
Nah, we're not sure which is different. Oh, oh
That's true. We're just different. Okay. Am I allowed to doxium? Am I allowed to say where he is?
Well, yeah, cuz by the time anyone hears this he'll be back so let's try to find him. He's in Adelaide. Oh
Okay, or as Australians call it Radelaide
Radelaide because it's so far from rad. It's not rad Adelaide is not rad at all
Not even a little bit
It's got wineries. So that's good
But Martin, I don't think Martin doesn't drink. So
Hmm he won't be taking advantage of that. I wonder what he's doing there. Hopefully he's having maybe he can maybe he can bring in like a
reporter on the scene
kind of
message right around
Here as to what's going on like live after the fact
record to tape live to tape
from Adelaide
now
Hi Hemispherians, I'm coming to you from Glenelg in Adelaide, South Australia.
I'm going to make this quick because frankly I don't think it's a top quality listening
experience to have audio coming from an iPad mini in a hotel room with a loud buzzing mini
fridge and doors closing outside and traffic and so on.
You get the picture.
So I'm going to share two things, two positive things that I've experienced in Adelaide.
thing I want to talk about Adelaide you have got the coffee situation perfect. Haven't
had a bad coffee yet, I mean we're only halfway through but big kudos to you and I want to
shout out a particular situation, coffee shop that we went to in Adelaide, my colleague
pointed it out, we went in, it was delicious but I think Sydney or broadly New South Wales
and maybe other states around Australia, maybe other countries around the world where there's
expensive coffee, you have a chance to put this right. Because in Adelaide, CBD, we walked
in and the guy behind the counter said, "Do you want an extra shot?" And we said, "Oh,
yeah, okay." And he said, "It doesn't cost any more." And we're thinking, "What do you
mean it doesn't cost any more?" He gave us an extra shot in each of our coffees, which
we generally enjoy, but held back a bit because it was the afternoon and, you know, the cost
stacks up. All together, two coffees, each with an extra shot, eight Australian dollars.
I can't remember the last time that we had a coffee for that price of that quality.
So Adelaide, you're putting Sydney and even my hometown of Wollongong to shame.
Unbelievable.
Well done.
Second thing relates more to the video work.
Travelling with my two teammates here in Adelaide, collecting video at different sites for the
company I work for.
Bit of a habit that we got into, instituted mainly by my manager, Craig.
We back up all of our video files at the end of the day.
Tim follows the same process.
He's the guy who very, very astutely pointed out
that correct coffee shop to go to.
And it's a bit of a stressful thing,
making sure that all of your video files are backed up.
You wanna get to the end of the day,
know that all of your stuff is safe and secure.
So we put things on SSDs at the very least,
upload to the cloud as well as we can.
That can be a bit of a long nightmare.
And my, let's just say,
carry-on luggage was not particularly kind this time.
Brought a gimbal along,
reached the maximum weight very quickly,
didn't have space for the work laptop.
And I thought, do I take the gamble with the iPad mini?
Is that going to work okay with SSDs and so forth?
And look, I'm all in on the iPad as a computer.
I use it all the time to edit this very podcast
when it's my turn.
I've done video editing on it.
I do photography stuff on it.
I believe strongly in it.
But file management, moving files around,
that's never been something that I've gone,
yeah, I'm really comfortable with the iPad
as a tool for this.
I really think about the Mac for that.
But you know what?
take the gamble here. Using a Satechi or Satechi however you're supposed to say it, dongle. This
time the dongle was my best friend and the iPad was indeed working as a computer for work. Brought
the iPad mini along, stuck the dongle in and into that very dongle with multiple ports, put the SD
card with the video from the day and on the other side Samsung 2 terabyte SSD and you know what?
easily put SD card files onto the SSD,
didn't even have to have them on the iPad mini
filling up storage,
and it was absolutely seamless all within the files app.
So look, very simple thing in the grand scheme of computing,
but I just want to say,
if you ever had a doubt that the iPad was able to tackle
just simple little computing tasks
to save weight for your carry-on luggage
or to make your day easier,
fear not, the iPad can step up.
So I would basically say as the moral of this story,
go to Adelaide, the coffee's good,
And don't be afraid to take an iPad instead of your Mac sometimes.
You will survive.
Anyway, back to the part of the show that actually sounds like it was recorded in a
quiet room with high quality microphones.
Thanks for having me.
Catch you later, Hemispherians.
Okay.
I think he's doing something, right?
That sounds...
Wow.
Whoa.
Thanks, Martin.
Oh, I don't know.
I think your whole take on Adelaide is wrong because it sounds pretty rad to me.
Wow.
I had no idea.
on that insightful coverage of the local area.
So we mentioned Adelaide and its wine.
What about beer?
You're a beer drinker, right?
Sure, yeah.
I've got a simple question for you.
If you're drinking beer, how are you most going to enjoy the beverage?
Where am I drinking this beer?
Can I get a little bit of visual representation?
What's going on here?
Where am I?
- Okay, let's say you're at a pub,
but it's more brewery.
It's a craft brewery.
- Craft brewery, okay.
- Yeah, some sort of smooth music playing.
It's a bit of the clink of glasses,
the low murmur of chit-chat and people.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- Visiting occasional, "Hey!"
from the table over there.
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, so are you gonna be wanting to,
and you can purchase your beer in three different ways,
because it's a brewery, they make it on site,
so you can choose how you want it served to you.
Okay, so you can get it pint glass.
- Pint glass, okay.
- Pint glass is probably Australian/UK term.
I don't know what you call a pint glass in America.
- Pint glass.
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.
- Served off the tap, okay?
Yeah.
You can get a stubby.
A stubby, do you know what that is?
Yes, a glass bottle.
OK, good.
Do you call it a stubby over there?
What do you call it?
A bottle.
OK.
Or you can get it as a tinny.
Tinny?
Do you know what a tinny is?
Probably an aluminum can.
Yeah, even an aluminum can.
Yeah, aluminum.
Yep, exactly.
Just like it's spelled, aluminum.
- Yep.
- Yep.
- So do you want a pint, a stubby or a tinny, mate?
- Oh, good question.
I am going to want a tinny in a pint glass
with the tinny left behind so I can enjoy the label,
the iconography and any other paraphernalia on the label.
Since you want to self pour into the glass. Yeah. Yep. I want to have the full experience of the pour
I want to be able to look at the can see what's going on. I like that whole thing. Yeah
Okay
Interesting about you. That's a good answer
What would you pick if I'm in that environment which I described every single stubby guy?
I'm not a stubby guy in that environment. No way. No, I'm a pint glass guy, but comes to you as a pint
You don't even see what was put in it. You don't care. Well, I watch them pour it out of the out of the oh, okay
Yeah, and you watch the poor as I tilt the glass get the head just right. Yeah
That to me and then drinking that it you can have a gulp
You can drink a pint glass with a certain gulp that you can't do with any other beverage
And it's just give more options. You can do like a sip a gulp a long
sip
Yeah, and then as you drink you get the tiger stripes down the opposite side of the glass and it's just something very
Satisfying about our clink - yeah, yeah good clink. You don't get that with a can
It's just kind of a dull thud. Yeah, if I'm at home and I don't have the option of a pint glass I
Used to be a stubby guy, but now I've converted. I'm back to being a tinny man tinny man. Yeah
It's hard to beat the
sound yeah, that's like pretty satisfying
It really is. Are you know the best thing about either getting a stubby or a tinny?
What's that is that you know in your hand when you finished you're holding?
Ten cents if you take that back to a recycling center, that's true
Is that is that way you're going rate is there ten cents ten cents per container? Yep
That is that countrywide or is that state dependent? It's a state dependent saying Western Australia. You can get 10 cents in
Queensland you can also get 10 cents. I have no idea what happens in other states
I wonder what New South Wales would be five cents. I'm gonna bet five
I don't even know if they don't even think I do it. Oh, I don't even care
They just chuck it away. Just chuck them right in the trash. They don't even recycle them. No, no. Oh
terrible
Okay, and our final question because I'm just thinking about beer what beer do you want to put in that pint glass?
This is the gabs corner. Yeah
You can be generalist. You don't have to have a brand probably like a wheat
Wheat beer would be good
I'm very I know this is controversial, but I'm very fond of these these sours
I like the sours don't you too?
Yeah, big sour fan. I do not understand the sour thing. Mm-hmm
Wow or anything from a local brewery called great notion if you're ever in the Portland area
great notion
Really good. Just every doesn't matter just get whatever they have and it's good
all of the shit
Yeah, okay
So like other than Foster's what would be your you're like, what's your second choice after Foster's? Yeah, of course Foster's is amazing
Obviously, yeah, every 40 the 40 ounce one
Those cans are like like 60 ounces I swear literally cannot get them in Australia. I don't know what that's all about
Like how could you be how could you have something that's so like
It's horny and it doesn't even get sold there. It's so wrong. That feels so wrong
So my I'm gonna choose a nice
Hoppy IPA. Oh
You're one of those IPA people. I think used to be but over the last
Four to five years. I've really lent into IPA life
I feel like that's probably the most overhyped beer ever would be my assumption
And I also must think that IPAs must be really easy to make
because everybody makes them now
and they're all just equally meh.
But I'm glad you like them.
- Yes, and I will go to perhaps an other side brewery.
That would be a good option.
Get their Anthem, get their Anthem.
- Is that a local Perth joint?
- Yes, yes.
And they have all their beers are based around
kind of music references. Oh, is there a Voyager one? Is that who did the Voyager one? No,
it isn't. Somebody else did the Voyager. Who did the Voyager one? Um, it's that place in
East Perth. You know the one. Oh, that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Old mate owns it.
Yeah, yeah. That's him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Do you know anyone that has listened
to every single episode?
'Cause I know a couple.
- I know three people.
- You know three people?
- Mm-hmm.
- Excluding us.
- Ah, I know zero people.
(laughing)
- I know two people who have listened
to every single episode for some reason.
I still don't fully understand the motivation there.
But they did, so good on 'em.
By the way, that is not like a requirement.
You don't have to listen to everything.
You're more than welcome to just come in right now.
Well, if they're listening, if they're listening on Apple podcasts,
they probably are.
And they have no way known of trying to find the old ones.
They'll never get back to it'll show them episode 17 and then they'll never be
able to find another one as long as they live.
So thanks for that.
But we've got, so,
Hey, Scotty J has listened to every single one for some reason. Again,
not sure why. And then, uh,
Rob also has recently completed the full back catalog.
This is like a trend now. Maybe, I don't know. I guess,
I think maybe this is some kind of challenge on the,
like a tick tock challenge on the internet where it's like,
they used to like jump off buildings.
Now they're like force yourself to listen to every episode of this random
podcast, I guess if it's a Tik Tok challenge, go for it.
The youth are going to do what they're going to do. Um,
so now Rob has done this as well. And for,
for everyone's benefit, I would say has given feedback per episode,
which is crazy. Cause again, this is, I'll remind you episode 91,
Plus there are 30 something one prime plus.com.
- Yeah, member exclusive.
- Member exclusive.
How can you get those as general public?
You can't, you have to go sign up for oneprimeplus.com,
the best URL on the whole freaking internet.
So go do that first, hit that sweet, sweet subscribe button.
And you know what? You get it all.
You get every episode from the back catalog.
Even if you leave after a month,
which I'm not like advocating or anything,
but like technically you could just join for a month
and get them all.
In the notes will be Rob's catalog review of the show.
Episode 000 through episode 091.
OPP episode 000 through oh whatever.
And I just was blown away that this was a thing.
So thank you to everyone who has listened
to more than one episode,
or even only listened to one episode.
We still think you're great.
So thank you.
- Thank you, Rob.
Like honestly, we have tried so many ways
of summarizing our show using automated transcripts
to systems.
If you really wanna,
if you wanna run down of like our entire back catalog,
just read Rob's review.
- Yeah.
And it's like, it'll just give you like a tidbit
for each one.
And you can think, "Yeah, that sounds like something.
Let me go jump in on that one."
So thanks to him for doing that.
That's a massive effort.
Thank you, Rob.
He also did the podcast length calculator thing, which was cool.
So I think we've linked to that before, but we'll put that in there again.
He's a smart guy, that Rob.
Yeah, he does a lot of cool, like just random...
He did something else.
What did he do that I just recently found out about?
I'm totally blanking now. He like built something like a long time ago that I knew about but I had no idea who he was at
The time is this that yeah, I carry what is it? I think we're on the same wavelength
It was something with a sort of thing. Yeah, cuz he's like
Yeah, he's not it or something and I was like, oh shit that was you like that's crazy. What was it Rob?
What was it? You should you need to you need to big note yourself more up
Goddamnit, what was it? It was it was something like
It was a pressure on the internet and I was like, oh shit. That was you Wow
I remember I said I'm a text message. I was like what this was you like
Yeah, tell me more cuz he said he was gonna write a blog post about it. I think it was friendster
It probably was friendster. That sounds right. Yeah, maybe live journal could have been live journal could have been that. Yep
GSTs, is he the my space guy? He might be Tom. Was that Tom?
Yes, it was Rob. It was Rob. Yeah, Rob. Yeah, Tom and Rob. Yeah. Yeah
Okay co-founders. Oh, yeah, we go
handled
Well, thank you for both the review and for my space Rob. That's that's been it's been legendary. Thank you
Imagine that you go from creating my space to listening to him straight views for hours on end. I mean, it's full-on really
[music]
[singing]
Insert extra audio here. I hope you were listening to the very end.
