Hi guys, welcome back to the show.

How are you going?

It's been a while since you've been here, so we're happy to have you back.

Your insertion last week was amazing, by the way.

Like, you really added value to the show.

Yeah, yeah.

I tend to say that I add value anywhere that I'm present.

That's beautiful.

Except I guess I wasn't present, so I guess I didn't add any value.

You should see the downloads we got for that episode, though.

Wow, it's really taken off.

I got a lot of emails saying never come back, but I thought, you know what?

I'm not going to do that.

I'm coming back.

I'm going to try for a comeback and see if I can win the people back.

Which means I won't be able to talk task management.

No more task management talking.

You can.

You'll just be shut down or ignored.

Yeah.

But you know what?

Your appearance, Jason, or your lack of an appearance, it kind of reminded me, have you ever been into like a museum or gallery of contemporary art and you come across that section that has minimalism?

I mean, I think it's a really good question.

I think it's a really good question.

I'd like to see you both in my weird circumstance, but I think it's all working.

If people are hearing this, then it's all working correctly.

Because I am on an iPad, so who knows what's going to happen.

But I think it's all- You look like you're Luke Skywalker on the Death Star, like speaking into the comlink.

Yeah.

So there's always this like, you can't record podcasts from an iPad and like, I don't know, it seems fine to me.

It's working.

It's working.

As well as I would expect.

I've got a call going.

I can see you both.

I've got my notes.

I've got a recording going that's lossless wave.

Yeah.

Seems good to me.

You have cracked the code.

I just hope you do at the end of this conversation, attack the comm panel with a blaster.

Well, I think you have to.

I think that's the only way to end the recording, really.

So that's my setup.

And then I think the other odd thing is that I'm a little- Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm a little dismayed that I assume that the last recording of Andrew in a bed was the one where I wasn't here and I missed it.

Cause he's not in a bed anymore.

It was pretty hot and heavy.

Yeah.

Man.

It was sultry.

It was steamy.

Any, any inappropriate word you can think of, it's what I had to look at visually.

Yeah.

I bet.

Look, that's correct.

That's right.

My ghetto studio is slowly being un-ghettoized.

I'm actually at a desk, which will be the permanent desk.

I'm not sure the setup is complete.

It's completely permanent yet.

I'm still talking into the old USB microphone, which I might keep.

I'm thinking I'm going to simplify the setup.

I may not go back to an audio interface at all.

I may just live the USB lifestyle.

Okay.

And the simple microphone from this point forward.

We'll see.

But yeah, back at the desk, it's weird to be sitting up, but I am still in my pajamas due to the early recording time.

So I like to think I'm bringing a little bit of bedtime.

To the desk.

It's weird to be sitting up.

Well, welcome back to the land of the sitting.

The color's disappearing from Andrew's face.

You can see the blood draining from gravity.

It's like...

So yeah.

So maybe the show is getting back to normality.

Well, I like the idea of you switching to a simplified setup, but I think it's pretty clear that that's not going to last.

I mean, that'll be two weeks.

Next time it'll be completely different setup.

Yeah.

I'm very sure of that.

Oh, I'm sure.

I'm sure.

The only thing we can be sure about is the Martin setup will not change.

No.

Same.

It's the same.

Speaking of setups, also referral code, canyon.blog/save, set app, but I'm talking set up.

It's been a year since Jewel of the Defaults.

It has been.

And I saw a blog post.

I intend to get back to it through a commenting system.

Somebody looking back at their default situation.

Yeah.

I think it's been a year.

Actually, this is a good point, I think, because we've just spoken about something that's really, really fast, right?

Those trains, just blazing speed, lightning.

On the other hand, Andrew's cooking slowly.

That's true.

I am.

And this is not really a deep dive into a topic, but just a credit to an old cooking method that I've been using a lot recently.

The slow cooker.

Oh, man.

I have a Breville slow cooker.

I think it's called a Fast and Go.

Or Fast and Slow.

And you're thinking, why does a slow cooker have a fast thing to it?

But it's also a pressure cooker.

It's a two-in-one.

Ah, yeah.

It's a two-in-one.

Is it that it's taking so long to cook that you're actually fasting while waiting for it?

Well, that's a good point, too.

But the glory of the slow cooker is that you can set it up in the morning, you throw your meat in, you come back at the end of the day, and it's ready to go.

And it doesn't matter what sort of cheap cut of meat you've put in there.

Yeah.

By the end of it, it is delicious.

Yes.

You're throwing gizzards in.

There's, like, tripe.

It's just a mess.

It's just slop, but it's beautiful.

Awful, as far as the eye can see.

Awful.

Yeah.

It's like meat magic.

It's just so delicious.

And if you put vegetables in there or sauces, it just infuses in.

And it's so nice.

I like to be sitting at work.

And it might be 2:00 in the afternoon.

And you think, "Oh, my little slow cooker has just been plugging away all day doing that hard work without any acknowledgement."

It's just been cooking that meat.

And you can leave it.

So if you're like, "Oh, I've set it for eight hours," but you don't get home for 10, there's no problem because you've turned on the keep warm setting.

So it gets to its eight hours.

But then it just starts, instead of counting down, it's counting up.

And the meat doesn't care.

It's so slow.

It's only going to get better, really.

I think you could slow cook for about six days and the meat would still be good.

Yeah.

So, look, shout out to slow cooking.

If you haven't tried it before, get yourself involved.

And, yeah, and even just now, if you are, if you don't have time for the slow cook, if you do go the pressure cook, that's like magic as well.

Because how does, how can slow cooking be so amazing?

But then if you cook something under pressure rapidly, it's also amazing.

Look, science is baffling.

I don't quite understand it.

But I have to shout out, I like slow cookers too.

And I'm sure these exist because I've seen similar things for like barbecues and smokers and things where they're app enabled or you can track them.

If anyone's looking into this like, "Oh, slow cooking, maybe I'll get into that.

Let's go and track this and that," don't do it.

Just let the slow cooker do its thing.

I agree with you, Andrew.

It's that thing of you go to work or you're out and about for the day with family, whatever the day may be, and it's just getting home and smelling it as you go.

And smelling it as you enter the room.

Just letting it waft over you, this cloud of aromatic excellence.

Don't track it.

Forget about it.

And come home and be surprised.

It doesn't need to be app enabled.

This is a good thing.

So, if anybody has any really good slow cooker recipes, share them on the Discord.

We have the food channel there.

Yes, we do.

I haven't really shared my slow cooker recipes, but maybe I should.

Maybe I should share some photos.

Yeah, it's delicious.

I've got a pressure cooker one I can share with you.

That is delicious.

Same kind of thing where it's like you just buy the cheapest stew meat you can get and it turns into 10 star level deliciousness.

It just doesn't make sense.

And yes, on the app enabled crap, don't waste your time.

Don't waste your money.

Because A, what is it going to do?

Tell you that it's done when you're away from your house anyway?

Who cares?

And then the next piece is like whatever that app is, they're never going to update it.

And they're probably going to discontinue it and it'll never work with another app again anyway.

So now you've just wasted, you know, another.

Hopefully it still works without that part.

That's the worst of it.

If it only works through the app, never buy.

I think that's probably just a blanket statement.

Never buy anything that only works through an app.

Probably just full stop.

I don't even think there needs to be like a star on that.

Just don't do that ever.

Because you're going to get screwed.

And that app is never going to have a dark icon.

No.

I'm stuck with it.

So there we go.

And you know that they're going to have like the name of it in the icon with the name underneath it in the label.

I don't know.

That's my worst nightmare.

It'll still be the version from like the iPhone 3G.

So you'll have like top and bottom black bars on like your pick.

With the fake gloss line?

Yeah.

Whatever that is.

The shine or reflection.

Yeah.

The weird shininess in the icon.

Yep.

Absolutely.

And then the last update will be nine years ago where it does that thing where it says, "This has been updated by Apple to do blah, blah, blah."

Like to change their certificate or whatever.

And that was nine years ago and never touched again.

Wow.

Although I have to say like just to make it clear to listeners, like Andrew, you said, "Oh, it doesn't matter what the meat is, Jason."

You were like, "Oh, it could be the cheapest stew meat."

We're not suggesting you go out and like scoop roadkill off the side of the highway or something.

I'm not dismissing it.

That may be fine.

Man, we're in a cost of living crisis.

You've got to do what you got to do.

Okay.

You got to get your meat where you can get your meat.

I'm not here to question your meat procurement.

Clearly in New South Wales, we have certain standards.

But thank you for the suggestion.

Rinse it off before you put it in this local kitchen.

Yeah.

Rinse it off.

That'll do.

Yeah.

Just give it a little quick run under the tap.

Yeah.

Just a little light brushing and you should be fine.

And that's Health Safety Corner.

All right.

Now, I've got another question for you guys.

It's a bit more technologically related.

Oh, okay.

So, as we all know, Apple did its big refresh of the Mac line.

They did?

What did they do?

You know they did that.

What Mac?

Like, what did they change?

You know this.

They went to the M4 processor.

Oh, finally.

Oh, good.

Okay.

Jeez.

Been a while.

I've been mostly offline for the last, like, two and a half weeks.

Are you being sarcastic or not?

I'm very confused.

No, I literally don't.

I don't know anything that's going on in the world.

It's fantastic.

Oh, my goodness.

Okay.

I don't know what's going on.

So, yeah, fill me in.

Since we're a tech podcast focusing on the Apple ecosystem, I really should summarize this in.

Oh, yeah.

Very, very.

Mm-hmm.

The Mac Mini got minier.

Oh.

It's like a mini studio.

Yes.

Oh, that's adorable.

Yeah.

And the iMac got more colorful.

More?

More colorful?

More like the same.

Is there a new color?

They kind of changed the two-toneness of it.

Yeah.

Oh, cool.

The colors are like the same but different.

Oh, nice.

Wait.

Is there still an orange one?

Yes.

And I think it's more orange.

Ooh.

I think.

I double-checked that.

But I believe it's more orange.

Orange.

Then what else happened?

The Mac Pros got their M4.

Mm.

Okay.

And now this is where I need your help.

Okay.

Processor-wise, I'm sure the M4 is very good.

It's more M-y.

It's got more M's than previous M.

Yeah.

I'm looking at that Mac Pro base model.

You're going to get a Mac Pro?

The Mac Pro.

MacBook Pro.

Not Mac Pro.

MacBook Pro.

Oh.

Sorry.

Wow.

That is quite the upgrade.

Okay.

The moment he got off the bed, he got really serious.

Yeah.

Wow.

All right.

He's doing some serious calculations over there.

I've got a desk to put a computer under now.

No, no, no.

MacBook Pro.

Oh, man.

Okay.

MacBook Pro.

Got it.

So, typically, the base model MacBook Pro is kind of a bit bad and you really probably shouldn't get it.

You should just get a MacBook Air.

But this MacBook Pro base model, I think it ticks all my boxes.

I'm moving.

So, I'm currently using the MacBook Air M1 Intel Edition, if you want to call it that, with the Intel design.

The, like, the wedgie thing?

The wedge.

Yeah.

Because I got on board M1, like, day one.

M1 day one.

Processor-wise, this Air is still fine for me, right?

I actually never noticed an issue with it at all.

So, I have no doubt that base model MacBook Pro M4 is going to be just fine.

Like, yeah, I could get something faster, but really?

Really?

I don't do rendering, video editing, any of that crap.

So, I just mainly want it for the nice screen.

The MacBook Pro screens are incredible.

So, you guys, and the price-wise, like, Macs are always expensive, forget that, right?

But I'm saving so much money with my slow-cook meat that I reckon I can, yeah, invest in a new computer.

I don't need...

I think they call that diversification.

Meat diversification.

Exactly.

I don't need a new computer.

This M1 is fine.

I just want...

This is just a pure want.

Okay.

So, tell me, guys...

You already know how I feel about wants.

Go on.

So, tell me, why should...

Is there a reason why I should not get the base M4 MacBook Pro?

Two questions.

Question number one.

Mm-hmm.

What size MacBook Pro?

You're going from a 13-inch MacBook Air.

I'm assuming there's still 14 and 16.

Correct.

Are you going 14 or 16?

Okay.

So, I did think deeply on this.

Because I've got the 13 MacBook Air.

And so, I thought, "Maybe I'll go really big and get 16."

I looked at an older version MacBook Pro that is the...

Before they upgraded, so it'd be like more like 13, 15.

So, I would have been looking at a 15-inch MacBook Pro just you had the other day.

And it took me back to the days when I had a 17-inch MacBook Pro and it was just too big.

I would go look at the actual 16s.

Because I have the 16.

And it really does not feel that huge.

I remember the 17 days of when that thing was like a lunch tray, literally.

Yeah.

I would go look at the 16s in person because they're big.

But with how small these things are now, I would consider it is all I would say.

Okay.

So, that was question one.

What was question two?

I already forgot.

That was the question.

What was question two?

Okay.

So, you're going to go 14, maybe 16, potentially.

Tell me what should I do?

This is, you know, help Andrew.

How often are you away from your desk with your computer?

Well, these days, I'm using my computer as an auxiliary computer at work a lot.

Okay.

It doesn't connect to monitors at work at all.

So, 16 would give you kind of the best possible screen while you're away because it's bigger.

So, you got that.

I'm assuming base model MacBook, like they used to do the thing where like the base one has a screen.

Yeah.

So, now, like the base one had like one port and the other ones had like five ports.

They fixed that.

Is that all gone now?

They fixed that.

So, now, there's ports on both sides.

There's three Thunderbolt ports, two on one side, one on the other.

Okay.

So, it's just basically what kind of, how fast do you need it to be and then the body's the same?

Yep.

I would say an M4 base for what you're doing is like totally fine.

Okay.

And you think big boy version?

Okay.

I would go look.

I think you have to see them in person and you can't compare the 16 now to like the old 15.

Okay.

Yeah.

Because they are so incredibly thin and small now that the 16 just, I don't think it's overly big.

Okay.

But it's worth going and looking.

I was looking at the Touch Bar 15.

Oh, yeah.

I would go look at the current ones.

Okay.

I think you need to see them in person.

Okay.

Thank you.

Providing they're the same as they were with the M2, because I have the M2 Max.

Yep.

I assume the body didn't change.

No, it didn't.

I would go look at them.

Okay.

But I don't think you're going to go wrong with an M4.

I think they're the same.

I don't think you're going to go wrong with an M4 base, because that thing is probably, it's probably faster than my M2 Max at this point, I would guess.

Could be.

Don't know.

And it'll probably last you till the end of your life, because these things are never going to die.

Yeah.

Cool.

So yeah, go for it.

Purchase.

All right.

Check out and you're good.

Surprising.

Jason would encourage me to spend a lot of money on a computer.

That's...

That is unlike me.

Let's hear from the more sensible Martin.

Well, look, over the last several years of doing this podcast with both of you, I've learned that when a question like this comes up, should I do X or should I buy this?

The only answer that is acceptable is yes.

Yay.

We've trained him.

So despite what I might actually think, Andrew, yes.

And if you ask me this or that, I say yes.

Ah.

Well, I think that's a good thing.

I think that's a good thing.

Actually, and we do have one more thing that I have to bring up.

Yeah.

This is an update for the listeners because we had a poll, if you may recall, on Mastodon.

Do you know what I'm talking about?

I do.

No.

What was our poll?

You don't remember the poll?

It was a seven-day poll.

It was a good one.

Jason, you didn't see it?

No.

All right.

So, it's closed now, but in the last episode, you may recall that Andrew and I were, you know, we took certain liberties in your absence.

Mm.

And, you know, in the course of doing that and then editing, I thought, we need to put a poll out, and I included in the show notes.

And the poll, and we'll link it again, it's now closed, from the Hemispheric Views social.lol account on Mastodon.

It said, "Without any further context about our next episode," one, two, three, "and whether or not you will have heard it after its publication, with which one of his co-hosts do you think that Jason will be angrier?

Have a guess and we'll find out in the following installment."

Now, I spoke about sabbaticals and the public.

I spoke about sabbaticals.

Andrew went off on task management.

That was episode one, two, three in the past.

This is now one, two, four.

The results were 18% Martin pissed off Jason Moore and 82% Andrew pissed off Jason Moore.

Wow.

So, clearly, people think you have more of an issue with Andrew either in general or from that episode.

Jason, do you have an answer?

Wow.

This is beef.

That is, I would have thought that would be more 50/50 than that, but wow.

No.

I would go full 100%.

I would go full 100% Martin for sure.

Great.

I think what happened here is that everyone assumed that the Martin part would have been the Andrew part.

So, I think they were conflating the two a little bit there.

Okay.

Wow.

Good poll.

I like that.

Thank you.

So, what made you most angry when you were listening back?

First of all, was it a strange experience listening to your own podcast if you have listened to it?

Yes.

And secondly, what did you hate or enjoy most?

What made you angry?

Oh, just saying the word.

I think that's the first, if you did a search across all of our transcripts, that has to be the first time that that word has been mentioned in the entire 123 episodes.

And I linked to a blog post that you didn't write about sabbaticals and said that it was you.

So, I thought, oh, I'm really going to ramp this up.

Yep.

Really good.

Thank you.

But let me tell you, look, the point of a sabbatical, Jason, like you said, I'm going on sabbatical.

I'm not saying you.

The point of a sabbatical is to step back, be at peace and, you know, be happy.

And quite clearly, you haven't lived up to that.

I'd say yes to the sabbatical, Jason.

Oh, my God.

It's called a vacation.

You're looking relaxed.

Get a grip.

You know, you look, you seem happier.

I think this is, honestly, this has been, over here, three weeks, we're two weeks in, this is like probably two of the best weeks of my life.

It's been absolutely incredible.

Beautiful.

I feel like I've been in a lot of trouble.
