I look up and I've got the two little boxes in the little window and on my left I've got
Not only do I have
Stereotypical as all get out blue colored long-sleeve colored shirt like it's that blue. It's like business blue
Right where it's like is it white? Is it blue? I can't tell then I've got
Glasses new glasses. So that's our that's another new thing. No beard still. We're still on the no beard phase
I think we're gonna come out of that pretty soon though. I feel like it's we're rounding the corner on that hopefully
Then we've got a tie with all kinds of boxes all over it
Diamonds, I guess you could say
which is kind of a that's like a
power-play for for you know closing deals and
Then we've got the coffee cup, which is a proper, you know cup cup
Yeah, it's just all very businessy today, and I don't know what to think then I go to my right
On the little boxes and we've got Martin over here in just a regular, you know t-shirt with
Pajamas with a sloth on them. That's right. So that's kind of that's the that's my two worlds that I'm
right now
Although I must make an observation just quickly before you launch in Andrew at the tie subtle hemispheric views bluey yellow
Theme happening there is that the deliberate of course is deliberate. Yes, okay good continue
And his brand new hemispheric views tie clip that's not a bad idea actually
Put that on the list
You're constantly giving me hassle about me being Thai guy and
So I felt that it was probably time to step up to the plate and actually
Be the man that you profess me to be so here I am buttoned up ready to go
Feel like it's an AGM. So if we if we want to move to agenda item 1.1
We more than welcome to but I will be running a tight ship tonight
Do you know the worrying thing is I actually don't wear ties as much as I used to at all anymore
and I actually pulled out a white shirt to begin with and I put it on and
Look, I don't know whether it's quarantine or just aging or what have you?
But I think I might have packed on a few pounds because the little button that goes around the neck that holds the tie all together
Yeah, that wasn't meeting that was not
So I had to switch to the blue shirt and even this one this is like my larger shirt this one kind of struggle
I'm gonna hit the gym boys
In seriousness you you recently did that
Work related podcast. Did you accidentally think you were recording another one of those right now?
And then when you when you fired up Skype, it was like oh
Hi guys, that's a great irony. I recorded my work podcast and I was wearing a t-shirt at the time
Now I'm here famous reviews and I'm all
Booted and suited although not entirely. I'm doing newsreader style guys. Hang on
There it is. Oh my goodness. I did not expect too much information there maybe
A lot of leg really I mean better than the other way around really for a recording, right?
Who knows where that tie would be?
It's true. I remember Ricky Gervais in his first stand-up special. He talked about a guy
he was friends with who imagined that it would be more romantic or sensual or appealing to
be with a mermaid who was the other way around and he was perplexed that you would want to
fish head on lakes.
[Laughter]
[Music]
It is a super good reason to be wearing a tie, because ladies and gentlemen, we have got a new business proposal.
We're hitting a more professional stride now.
Some of you have helped us out in the past. You helped us out, you bought us Kofis.
You went and did the "Buy me a coffee" and we appreciate both of those things.
Some of you went to Store Envy and bought stickers and t-shirts.
We appreciate that too, but we know that was challenging.
So you're hearing me.
Kofi, buy me a coffee, store Envy.
Kofi, buy me a coffee, store Envy.
Are you getting me?
We're merging those three things
into a whole new technology that we're calling Patreon.
- That's original.
- That's right.
- Synergy.
- Patreon.
That member service that you know and love
from a thousand other sites already,
yeah, we've got that too.
(laughing)
So get rid of
Kofi buy me a coffee
Smush it all together. We are opening the curtain
Unveiling the beautiful wonderful blue and yellow hues of the hemispheric views
patreon supporter site patreon.com
Hemispheric views what we're doing. We're expanding the hemispheric views universe
so the show that you love will persist as you love it. Nothing's really changing here,
but you're going to find some sweeteners. You're going to find three different levels
where you can show your support for a certain hemisphere, you can go global,
you can essentially be a superfan, and depending on what you get, you might get access to some
extra content. There might even be some sort of merch deals there, maybe even exclusive space to
continue talking. You should check out the link in the show notes and find out which level of
sweetener you want to go for. Do you think that's fair? Yeah I just look at it as a nice simplistic
easy one-stop shop to get everything you could want plus bonus extra stuff that isn't just
randomly available on this thing we call the internet. Right so sign up today that's your
instruction. The FeldFoot's coming down I'll know who didn't sign up. He knows people.
Who put app tracking transparency in the list? Do we want to discuss this?
I don't really want to get into like super fine detail about it. I just think the whole thing
has become very confusing and I'm supposed to know about all this crap, right? Like it's been
this whole thing between Apple and Facebook, you know, crying at each other about tracking and so
forth, mostly crying from Facebook. And then they turned and said, "Oh, actually, it's
fine," because I'm sure they found some loophole that they're going to exploit to track people
anyway, because it's Facebook. And then I was reading a couple articles where it was
referred to as AT&T in all caps for app tracking transparency. And I thought they're talking
about AT&T the carrier. And it sounded very disparaging at first. I was like, "Oh, shoot,
going on between Apple and AT&T that seems like a problem but it wasn't it
was this and then like 14.5 beta has been in beta forever and I've been on
the beta forever and when you're on the betas you kind of tend to forget about
what actually was in it once it comes out and so it'll come out everybody's
like oh we get these five features and it's like oh shoot yeah we've had those
for a long time. I guess it's off by default so when everybody was talking
about okay when this comes out you got to go flip the little switch so nothing
can track you or whatever and I never got any of these pop-ups on my phone I
never got anything talking about it I went and looked it was off so I guess
the option is you turn on an option to even allow people to ask for permission
I think it's I don't know. It's it's kind of weird. I think it's off by default
I don't know if you guys have looked at it yet, but I'm I didn't get on the beta track
Mine was on by default. Oh
And is that the one allow apps to request a track? Yeah. Yeah, is yours on or off Martin?
I turned it on I think see this way it gets confusing mine was off in that
It was already preventing the request
Yes, so it was immediate denial as as default right and I think that's how mine is as well
Yeah, so should it be off? Is that what you're saying? I don't know
I think that's what's confusing about it is because there was supposed to be this system in place to allow me to
Granularly say yes or no if a certain app can do it
But if the default is it's not even gonna ask and just auto block everything
It's a little bit scorched earth in a way and I mean
I don't have a dog in that fight in terms of advertising, so I guess I'm fine with it
But it just seemed kind of confusing and I don't know what the normal
What what would actually make me want to go in and say yes
I want to start getting bothered with a thousand things saying can I track you?
You know like everybody already is annoyed with notifications. Why would I want to enable more?
Notifications. I mean, this is the ultimate power of defaults, right?
Apple can Apple can choose a default and suddenly a billion iPhones and not sending data
And I don't get they don't get the opportunity to even ask because the default is no and I think that's what the default is now
You've got me questioning everything. I thought I
Could be completely wrong and there could be you know
A billion people screaming at their phone right now at how dumb I am for saying this
But it just it seems like there was a lot of buildup about all this choice that you were gonna have except
The the overarching umbrella choice was chosen for you. So forget all that other crap that we talked about
I don't know
It's it's it's an interesting one for sure because I I just don't know what to really make of it
is it possible that you know, it works as we kind of expected but
It's been worded in a way that's a little bit vague or isn't shoved in people's faces the moment they update because you know
It's not like a splash screen that comes up upon the end of updating
So the function exists as intended
But it's not pissing off the likes of Facebook or people who want to collect your data
So Apple's doing the right thing but not being too pushy or direct like they kind of took the bite out of a little bit
I I was assuming that actually I just
Started to change my mind when I've not gotten a single, you know with the
3,000 apps that I have installed not one of them has popped up and asked for anything that seems highly unlikely
So which which way just to clarify which way is your toggle is your toggle set to off like black or is it green?
On gray toggle is off and I believe was off for me
I don't unless again the beta has been you know
800 months now, so there may have been some point where I was like, ah turn that off
I don't even want to see it. So that's possible. I'm not sure what it looks like on a new install
Well mine was new because I don't do it the betas and I went in to look at it and was like us turned off
And then I went through that thought process. Yeah, mine is toggled to show green because I understood it to mean
Okay, you will have the option with these dialogue boxes to say no don't do that, but I will be asked
That's how I understood the instruction.
Yeah.
So we need to find the copywriter at Apple that wrote that little bit of text and say,
"less of the double negatives and give us a clear instruction."
Can we ask our audience, please give us some feedback on this one?
Because between the three of us, none of us have an idea, right?
And we're supposed to be informed about this stuff.
So it'd be great to hear what others have discovered about app tracking.
Or at least if people have received the dialog box, even if they don't get it themselves.
Yeah, is yours just off by default? And if so, what on earth would make you turn it on?
You might miss out on those sweet customized ads.
Oh, I love getting ads for the surface on Twitter. It's great.
It's not a joke either.
More things that start with A, I can see Apple Arcade in the list.
I'm interested to talk about this, although I didn't add it. Is this another one of Jason's?
I bet it is.
Speak.
Jason's running on about three of six cylinders at the moment, I think.
I'll keep targeting it.
Yeah.
Apple Arcade, I would just say is really finally coming into what I think everyone thought
it was going to be.
I don't know if it has staying power.
I mean, obviously when a company like that, that's behind it is as big as it is, they
can choose to run it at a loss as long as they want or as long as they feel like it's
still providing them some value.
But I know in the beginning of Apple Arcade, it was like a big, big launch, lots of games.
It was a big deal, kind of fizzled out for a little while.
Then it felt like somebody sort of remembered that Apple Arcade was a thing that they needed
to keep going.
It wasn't just going to just put it in the world and it was going to take over by itself.
You had to keep feeding the Apple Arcade machine.
So I think it felt like we got a bunch of new deals coming in and new games.
And it's been good for me personally.
I've been playing a lot of Apple Arcade lately.
And I'm just now starting to wonder if there is a kind of third act for Apple Arcade or
if I thought the third act was going to be a new Apple TV, to be perfectly honest.
I thought there was going to be Apple TV, whatever fifth gen, whatever generation we're
on with the M1 chip that does crazy graphics and now your TV, some kind of Apple type chant
of like, forget the new PS5 and Xbox Series X, you've already got the next gen.
Some crap like that is what I was expecting.
here's a game controller maybe that we've made and we've
done 800 billion hours of research to find out that this is the
one true game controller and half the world would hate it, half
the world would love it, and then we'd be off to the races with a new
gaming platform. That didn't happen. I guess iPhone is still the biggest gaming
platform or whatever I think they usually say. That's fine. I'm not a big
phone gamer person. I guess I'm old. I still prefer, you know, sitting in
front of the TV like an old person playing games.
Well it's bigger and it sounds better. It makes perfect sense.
Apple Arcade just, it feels like one of those services that's so damn good and yet it
feels like it just keeps getting pushed right up to the line and then it kind of
rolls back down and then we roll it back up the hill and it kind of rolls back
down. I don't know what the kind of general world consensus is on it. I don't
hear about it a lot. You know, there's not a lot of stuff being written about it.
The typical blogs will write up, you know, some little thing if there's new
games just to kind of have their full coverage. But Apple Arcade is just a
weird one to me. It's super cheap. It's five bucks a month for all the games.
You get it for free if you know for free if you're with Apple one and all that
I don't know you guys both have it. Obviously, I don't do you use it at all?
Do Andrew you have kids your kids use it at all?
And do you ever hear anyone talking about anything related to Apple arcade out in the world?
Entry you go first. Okay. Well to answer the very first question about the kids playing it. No, I
Actually the one who so my eldest is like 10. He's he's either
Playing roblox or something like that or he's on the switch playing a game there
Apple arcade kind of just goes into this no man's land. He's not showing any interest in
A younger son. He would actually be more liable to do it because he quite likes getting on an iPad and playing a game
but he's uh
There's no game suitable for him. He's just that a little bit too young for there to be really be anything
Fantastic so he kind of misses out as well
Moving on to me. I I just find the games to be a little bit boring. Yeah, they're not they're not the triple-a
Sort of games that you would find
So many of them are designed around that iPhone sort of approach of you've got five minutes to kill
Let's have a quick puzzle level that you can do one-handed. So
Everything is built around a tiny screen a tiny by gaming standards that sort of screen
So even if it's on the Apple TV and they make it available on it
It's pointless because it's not really ever designed for that device
It is an iPhone device first and foremost
They make it cross compatible because they have to as part of the terms of the contract
But that's that's not where the money's at. So so yeah, I've got a few of the games installed
And they just don't have any staying power for me. I'll play them for half an hour
I don't even I see the icon and I'm almost like
I have no desire to load that again, even if it was sort of captivated me for the 30 minutes. I played it
I know that it's just another 99 levels of the same thing at a slightly more
Increasing difficulty level. No, it's not working for me. I'm paying for it. I'm paying for the Apple one premium
Give us everything you've got planned, so I get it.
But if it went away tomorrow, I wouldn't miss it.
They got a bit closer with the bringing in the old games that were actually
good paid games. You know, the sort of the previous generation of games have been brought into the
arcade world and I like that, but that's not because Apple Arcade's good.
That's because those games were good when they were made and now Apple has bought them. And the one I'm looking forward to is
Forensic because I have great memories of playing forensic on my iPod touch
Going to work every day on the bus
So I hope that the rewrite of forensic sort of brings back some happy memories for me apart from that like there's just nothing
Nothing doing I tried playing probably the other one is wonder box to be fair. That's really quite good although again
I'm not very good at it, and maybe this is a more of a reflection on my gaming skills
But again, I sort of I played it. I try to play Jason's level and I think that was the straw that broke the camel's
Back, he destroyed me
It's pyramid. I couldn't figure it out. It's too hard
So now Apple I can't just I'm not loving it. Yeah adding my two cents
I agree with a lot of what you said Andrew the thing for me besides the fact that a lot of the games seem to
Be built for the iPhone is that Apple kind of thinks that everyone in the world loves puzzle games and I really
Don't enjoy puzzle games very much. I'm happy to give Wonderbox a go and I know there's that puzzle element to things
But I really like a bit of a racing or an action game
Racing games on Apple Arcade if they are there to me are mostly rubbish
I don't like things that have assistive controls which really comes from that touch first iPhone world
I would like something like a Forza or a Gran Turismo not really happening found that in a separate paid rally game
The first thing that I tried that I really liked that had a controller requirement was actually Samurai Jack
I don't know if either of you two have tried this or heard of the franchise
I think it was a TV show or set of games years ago
I had no knowledge of it, but Samurai Jack is like a third-person game where you are directing this samurai around actually
fighting things
fighting enemies and
And the controller has buttons that do different moves and you can control both the movement
and the perspective with the two joysticks and all of the heads up display or separate
controls recede.
So it's purely the action of what's going on.
Now I'm not saying this game has the most realistic graphics or most cutting edge sort
of look of any games that you would find on Playstation or Xbox but it felt like a console
first game and I thought "Aha, finally I've got something to invest some time in.
this is fun, this feels like it was made for a physical controller. So to me that's what I'm
really looking for. I want something where I'm diving into a story or running around.
Puzzles and things don't really do it for me. Something that I'd love Apple to do, and I know
this is probably terribly unrealistic, but they have the money to buy things. The real appeal of
Apple Arcade to me is the fact that it is a subscription. Now I've never thought that
subscription was a good word before necessarily. You're chucking money into something that you
don't necessarily use like a gym or newspapers delivered to your door, not a great word,
but in this case because you're paying for things that live in this database, this thing that is the
app store, you assume that they're not going to go away, they're part of this staying library,
and I think about the fact that I have this Xbox 360 plugged in under my TV and it's there mostly
for nostalgic purposes to fire up an old game, but then I think about the fact that my absolute
favorite console game of all time, critically smashed as it was at the time, is the game
Enter the Matrix. Enter the Matrix is not compatible on that Xbox 360 even after post-update.
It is locked away on original Xbox, low resolution, the disc tray isn't even opening properly
anymore on the one that I have and I think, why on earth is my absolute favorite console
game not playable on anything unless I have some Windows PC emulator? Unacceptable. So
I think to myself, why can't Apple go out and cherry pick these long forgotten awesome
games and somehow reprogram or recalibrate them and just own them and put them on the
platform.
People might look at me and think, "You're being ridiculous, Martin," but think of something
weird and imaginative.
That's what I'm getting at.
Put on classics that you can't get anywhere else and then have some staying power.
Game preservation is a huge issue overall and it's only going to get worse, honestly.
already difficult. Like if you go to archive.org there's a bunch of different
ROMs on there from generations of consoles which is great but much of that
stuff was pre all this DRM crap or at least it was in the beginning of DRM
when it's very easily crackable. So now it's like you know 20 years from now the
games we have today are gonna be very difficult to find and/or play to your
point. So I don't know what the answer is but it sure would be nice to have some
kind of steward with a crap ton of money to just say "hey we're gonna we're gonna
archive all of this stuff and make it playable in some way." I don't know what
that looks like to your point. Would they do it? Probably not because there's not
gonna be you know services revenue for that. But yeah that game preservation
And that's a whole other area that is definitely in need of someone to take it over.
I don't know if that's archive.org or something like that.
That's going to be a major problem.
Think about all the times that Apple at their various keynotes have had game demos on stage,
right?
And they're always painful, okay?
But they're designed to show off, "This is the best that we can deliver on this hardware."
It's the best expression of the hardware
None of those games are on Apple Arcade
Yeah, why not?
Why not just throw whatever money they need to throw to get all those games that they demoed as best-in-class
And put them on Apple Arcade it might give a reason for people to subscribe
Yeah, it might give some additional revenue and sure there's no downside to it
I mean, I wonder how much those publishers don't want to do it
That's the other piece though is as much as Apple wants them to be on there if they're only saying
You know you get two cents for every time somebody starts up your app in the arcade
Maybe the deal just sucks. I don't know what it looks like from a from a game publisher standpoint other than just saying
Hey, we're gonna promote you on Apple Arcade and it's like yeah, but that's for you know a day
Yeah
And then what happens, you know on day 60 when?
Literally, no one even opens my app anymore, and I've only gotten eight dollars
I don't know what that deal looks like
Maybe the deal is just shit and that's why we're not getting a lot of games
And that's why I wonder when it comes to the point of game preservation
I know my suggestion is probably ridiculous, but you think about how in TV streaming
Companies like Netflix really jumped in and bought up all of this stuff to create a library of content
And yes those things start to fade, you know things like friends or the office when studios wake up to themselves and go
"Oh no, we need to actually have this on our platform or take it back."
Why not do something like that with games? Because I know, I mean, Natasha probably won't
mind me sharing, but she told me about how much she loved eye toy back in the day on the PlayStation 2
or things like Snake on old Nokia phones. And I know I'm just sort of grabbing at different
examples, but people have really, really strong memories of these classic games. And like both
of you just mentioned before, these classic iPhone games that come on, suddenly everyone
starts talking about arcade again. What if they could buy things or license things and
be a little bit more imaginative so people go, "Oh, that thing with that brand power
or recognition or nostalgia is now on that Apple thing. I want to try that out."
Yeah.
Surely it's possible.
How long until there's Apple app catalog where you pay 50 bucks a month and everyone that
opts into it, your app, it's basically set app on your phone.
Oh, right.
You know, like you don't have to necessarily be in that, but if you check a box as a developer,
you're now in the Apple app catalog and everyone that subscribes to Apple app catalog just
gets all the apps.
No more of this, you know, buy every single app, you know, in-app purchase bullshit.
It's just like, you know, pay whatever the number per month and you get access to all
the apps.
It could be really terrible or it could be really good or maybe it's just kind of something
in the middle.
I don't know, but it just seems like a natural, everything is already a subscription at this
point.
When is it just, you know, pay, if you want to get super cynical about it, at some point
you just get to, you pay Apple $150 a month, they give you a phone and a tablet and a laptop
and access to all the apps and you just are renting the whole thing.
I know that's like, I'm not saying I want that.
I'm just saying like in a super, you know, cynical subscription world,
that kind of seems like the logical progression.
I'm going to have to mail this tie to you, Jason, cause you've just nailed the
business model. The perfect business model has just been outlined by you, Mr.
Burke. You get the tie.
Oh man. That goes,
that goes completely against everything that is my personality test.
Well, there's a segue.
- What's this personality test you speak of?
- Couple of weeks ago, I think it was a couple of weeks ago,
maybe it was a couple of days ago,
I got a link to a person,
I think it's a personality test, basically.
Basically what it feels like is one of those things
where when you've been at a larger-ish company,
somebody hears about a thing that is like a type test,
basically, of what kind of person you are.
- Myers-Briggs.
- Yeah, right.
And then everybody in the company has to take this thing to figure out how everybody works
best with each other.
Everybody's annoyed about it.
They all do it because their manager says they have to, which is kind of what happened
here.
And then you have a two to three hour review session with your team about how everybody
did.
And then you never talk about it again.
That's usually how these go.
And whoever provided the test made probably several million dollars.
Anyway, not that I've done several of these in my life, but my manager sent me one of
these the other day, the gentleman that's currently wearing a tie, and I thought, you
know what, what the hell, I'm gonna take it.
I'm gonna do it.
It's called Principles...
What is it called?
Principles U.
Principles U, yes.
Not a sponsor, right?
We're just clarifying that?
Not a sponsor, although if they're more than welcome to sign up or even buy a Patreon package.
Yeah.
is behind it. I think he's some sort of big bigwig in the VC scene so I'm sure
he could afford a monthly subscription. If anyone can burn VC money it's me so
send it our way. So I took the test it took maybe I don't know 20 minutes or
so and it's one of those where it's just asks you a kind of a pretty general
question about you and then you answer anywhere from strongly disagree to
strongly agree and there's like four or five options in between.
I think neutral was in the middle.
Once you get through about 10 minutes of it, you start questioning basically
everything about your existence and you start answering the questions as you
start out answering the questions objectively, then you start answering
them as what would somebody else say if they were asked this question about me?
Then you double, double guess yourself on each one.
Then you start thinking that it's asking you the same question slightly differently
to check and see if you're a liar.
I noticed that.
So then you go through that.
You kind of have like the whole like deaf, you know, levels of, of, of self
reflection, then you start wondering, you know, when the hell is this going to be
over?
Cause it doesn't give you any kind of progress as to how far along you are.
So, and then you finish and then you read through the things.
And the thing I like about this one is it instantly lets you start comparing
yourself to basically whoever they, they call it friends, which I thought was
interesting because I would think this would be more in a work type environment
so I don't I mean friends is fine whatever.
Frenemies. But anyway you can you can compare it compare yourself to your
friends. Anyway I took the test and I found it to be kind of interesting
mostly because I got to see Andrew's side of things and I was interested to
see how incredibly different and/or alike we are. It gives you an archetype
and mine is the individualist. Really? I'm surprised. Surprise surprise. I've never
heard that word to describe any American. I'm a trailblazer if you hadn't noticed.
I'm looking at the little islands you really are just an island all by
yourself. Wow. Yeah, it's kind of depressing actually. I was pretty excited about it because
it gives you, it said I was an individualist, then artisan, and then entertainer were my three
most closely matched archetypes. What were you guys? Well I was very amused for a start because
I didn't really read the email properly so I did the entire test and got my results but didn't do
the comparison thing so, well look I completed the test I just didn't compare with you two but I do
have the full pdf here i thought it was very fascinating and i actually found it pretty
accurate i i don't place a lot of not necessarily trust but a lot of emphasis or importance on
personality tests like this because i'm generally anti-quantification in that way but i i do think
it's a pretty cool tool to compare with others so i mean how do you want to run through it well
what is your primary archetype martin okay so my primary archetype which i feel is somewhat
Predictable or relevant you could you could disagree
My best match is the orchestrator
So at least it's not the the dominator or something like that with the failed foot coming down hard
Well the summary here I can read it to you. It says you are most like the orchestrator
orchestrators excel at bringing people together
Organizing around them and mobilizing resources to achieve and exceed expectations. They tend to be planful precise
engaging and people-oriented
It's like a LinkedIn recipe right there
Yeah, I think you should just copy and paste that over to your LinkedIn right now. I think that's that's it
That's the key and what I particularly enjoyed was the fact that it gives you the talents and the growth needs
Which is just a way of saying what you're good at and what you're not very good at
Yeah, I'd be interested to hear what yours are. So what was your archetype Andrew? We've got what do we have individualist?
We have orchestrator and what are you my best match is a planner. What?
Of course, come on plan
Planners are driven to put structure and systems around goals
Translating ideas into practical and achievable plans. They tend to be plan for methodical and results oriented
Now it doesn't say this but I can add on just don't get the planner to actually do the doing
Because at that point I'm out don't make me actually do stuff
I'll plan out how to get this stuff done. But that's on somebody else to do it
You'll notice that Jason is actually the one who does all the creative work
Martin you're the one who organizes and gets us together
What is Andrew actually doing damn it he's doing nothing
Genius to be fair. I also have the attributes of the investigator and the strategist
Well, I had some crossover with Jason in that my good match and my moderate match were entertainer and planner
Actually, I cross over with both of you in a way. Oh
So you and I both have entertainer you and Andrew have Oh planner
We need to Venn diagram this don't we I think so. So I'm like the hybrid of two of you in a way
Yes, it's the thing that's fantastic about this is it doesn't just go to that level of detail
It gives you all your how you prefer to think like are you creative or deliberative or practical?
How you engage with other people how you apply yourself and there's all these different explanations
And with any personality test these are always like well duh you read it and you think well duh
And it should be kind of dirt because you're looking at your own answers about yourself, right?
So it should sort of make sense
So I think that's kind of cool
But so getting that in itself and about you is it's kind of interesting to read
But where it really comes in to value and I guess this is where they're gonna try and sell it to the corporate
Companies is when you compare your results with one other person now
Unfortunately, Martin didn't follow the instructions.
So he doesn't get the benefit of this, but there's actually a whole page where
like I'm looking at it here and I was saying, compare results between me and
Jason and it gives us charts.
And so, so it shows us on all these different measures.
Am I low, very low, moderate, high, very high.
Where do I sit?
And then where does Jason sit on that same measure?
So we can see that the first one that jumps out in the creative measure, guess
what I am guys very low Jason is very high I also have my own school so I can
throw in if you're curious about any particular one I'm just not tell us what
you are on creative because we're the polar opposites all right here we go I'm
just scrolling scrolling hopefully moderate so he's right in the middle
high at 64% okay pretty good pretty good we can go through all of them but I was
just thinking like what is your lowest one what is your highest one and which
one did you look at and were either surprised and/or angry at? Which probably says a lot actually.
Martin you can go first. Okay so my highest one at 95% very high was that I
think conceptually and my lowest at 11% was practicality my lowest at 3% was
tough I'm an absolute pushover you tend to be less confrontational and more
diplomatic in your style seeking corporate cooperation and compromise of
a more disagreement and critique of others others ideas and positions yeah
I'll run from a fight I'm not interested in having it so this is in your
engagement category is that right? Yes that's my lowest how I engage with
others. What was your toughness Jason because I feel this correlates to how
I'm accused with being the Feldfoot so this would put it to rest. 38% low. 48%
moderate so it's not in the high category but I'm definitely tougher than both of you.
This thing is broken it's broken we all know it's a hundred and forty eight percent. What you it
says here generally straightforward in expressing your thoughts and opinions
No, never. That's not me.
What? Who would have imagined it?
I'm going to pry it out of you. Now, Jason, what was your highest and lowest?
Highest is under how you prefer to think creative, 93%, very high. And my lowest, I have a lot
of low. 7% 8% it looks like practical is my lowest. Very low. Which is completely accurate.
Is that risky for a podcast for two-thirds of its hosting staff to be impractical? I
don't know. Screw practicality. What was your highest Martin? My highest was thinking conceptually
That was the one although up there in the high was detail and reliability
extroversion
Humor tailed and reliable for me. It was high to
74 on that one. Yeah, I got 74 for detailed and reliable
This is how we've managed to keep a podcast running for this length of time man
With our craft documents and Trello notes and everything because with detail and reliable leadership
74 yeah, that's pretty oh, oh I got 7%
Wow
That's amazing. 7%!
Just tell me what to do guys, I'm right there with you.
[Laughter]
Which one did you find to be like, "That's not right."
Like, which one did you look at and say like, "Come on, that's BS."
Or just you were very surprised by it?
Okay, well, first I should just close the loop.
I'll say my highest was conceptual at 82%.
I like to think abstractly and philosophically,
Using theories and models to solve problems like a spreadsheet. So the most wrong what was your most wrong Martin?
Hmm my most wrong
It gave me 40%
Moderate for flexible and said you prefer environments with less change and uncertainty and tend to be less focused on personal growth and development
While being versatile in the roles you play in different circumstances
I felt that was pretty accurate, but I actually thought the 40% moderate rating was too generous
Okay, I think I'm actually a little bit more rigid than what it than what it said, but I'm happy to take that compliment
So you're being flexible. Yeah, I'm being flexible with the flexible
So I'm upset at the humble category
Let's see if he's humble or not in this but now for another reason because when I think of humble it seems to be
Different than what it's saying in the description. So first of all under humble
10%
Come on, that's not true. Typical American
That is just not true. And then it says you you tend to be less receptive to critical feedback
That's valid
But I wouldn't it doesn't that doesn't say humble to me
So less valid to reset or less receptive to critical feedback or eager to openly exist
Examine your mistakes weaknesses and blind spots getting angry about it
And may prefer to project self-confidence rather than modesty
What is this a self-confidence? I would not equate necessarily with gloating or bragging. Do you know I mean you can be
Self-confident and sure of yourself, but not go
Rejecting or professing it. So yeah, I mean it seems a little bit mixed in its meaning there
But yeah, I do like the irony of this
Show you humble
The one I'm most uncomfortable with is my category about how I engage with others and the category itself is nurturing
Oh, yeah, you were low on that. I got a score of 7%
Nurturing because your results are into Andrew
You tend to be less sensitive and aware of people's needs feelings and tendencies
I have been meaning to talk to you about that need to talk HR, but fair enough. Okay, I can see that to a point
I am NOT the most cuddly
You know like bear around
But that makes me seem like a total prick. You're a monster
I like to think that I at least give some consideration to how others are feeling and how they might be taking things
That just sounds like I'm just bull at a gate like bugger you we're doing it my way
Do you think though and I mean I haven't worked with you in an office environment
Outside of this very official podcast with you wearing a tie
It might not necessarily mean that you're getting stuck into people or you know being aggressive. Yeah, well, I'm only three percent tough
Yeah, there you go. So you're not tough. You're not you're not barking at people that makes total sense
So is it do you find yourself in?
working circumstances
to just not really engage with
Other people in their stories don't I mean you're not dismissing them, but you're not getting emotionally invested in things
That is true. That's probably detached. Yeah, that's probably true
Yeah, it is hard to find that part of me that cares enough about that stuff because how do we compare I would say
What about you Jason? How nurturing are you? Oh, I'm hella nurturing
41% give him a hug. Well, I'm sorry guys, but I've been rated with nurturing 63%
So what does that mean for the Feldfoot? That's because you have Mac mini now, but I mean, let's be fair
You have to throw in the Mac the Mac mini
Coefficient there. Yeah, you would have taken this previously to that. It would have been like 1%
That's right. So you're saying that I've been 62% by fatherly hormones as that is. Yeah
Yeah, this this turned your your your black heart into
Gold it's true. I noticed a lot of movement from my chest recently that wasn't there before like this kind of pulsing
I don't see that about yep Mac mini coming to the rescue
There's one that I'm particularly interested in and it's the one that I've gotten better about over time
I if I'd done this quiz a few years ago
I would have gotten a very low score and I feel like I've improved and it's been an active
I'm actively being trying to improve this part of my personality and that is
Extraversion
Because I used to be shy as anything and I'm still not mr. Extraversion, but I'm no longer fearful of
Talking to people or anything like that. I'm doing a podcast for goodness sake
So so my extroverted score was 28%
Which is still low
Granted but I think that's a market improvement on what I might have gotten previously
So does that sit in the low category is that I still say low which I'm a little disappointed about
Because I would have liked to have got at least gotten into the medium or something
You tend to prefer less social activity and to engage in more intimate settings be more cautious than adventurous in the activities
You like to participate in with moderate comfort asserting yourself in social situations when necessary
I think that last bit maybe crank that up a little bit more
But just curious where you guys sit with extroverted. I'm gonna guess Martin is like 95 80 80 plus for sure
I'm gonna say like a
83 very close 81% very high
Thought so. Yeah, apparently I thrive at the epicenter of social activities. I've always thought of you as the epicenter
It's true though. I I mean I've shared stories with you before about how I can't resist speaking to people in public situations
Situations particularly like at service counters. I have this I don't know this uncontrollable urge to talk. Hmm
You're in the right medium. Yeah, that's it somehow managed to rein it in and share the microphone with two other people
So that's good. But yeah, you were correct. I'm very extroverted
I think Jason's probably around 63% Maybe maybe attending a little bit higher
He has said that he's pretty introverted though. So in actual reality, I would be probably about a three
So most people don't notice I am a I am a timid mouse
who is afraid of its own shadow in in regard to
extraversion, but I have
crafted and molded and built an infrastructure of
Fake
Extraversion that I am able to put on like a Superman suit a persona. So therefore I'm I am able to break
Tests like this. So instead of a three
Got a 39. Oh
Well done. Yeah
Pretty good lower than I thought you'd get
Honestly, you come across as such a more extroverted person than I think you give yourself credit for. Oh
Yeah, you don't know what's going on up
between these headphones
Just fear pure fear you two are definitely on one end of the scale and I'm far on the other side. So
What is it particularly that you would say?
Makes you more uncomfortable or feel more introverted because right now I think you know we have a great discussion
You know online particularly things like micro dot blog
Had I never spoken to both of you personally in this way before I would have thought both of you are fairly extroverted
You seem very open to to share things
But sometimes it doesn't mean that it's more about whether you're the life of the party or whether you get your ideas from external sources
Who knows so where would you say that the true introverted nature comes out in both of you Andrew?
Do you wanna start I think with me it comes out in that it's that where you get your energy from
So I don't mind spending time with people
But it depletes my battery and I can feel and I'll get a point
I'll get to a point after a couple hours or two three hours or whatever and it's like cool man
I'm I need to get out of here. I'm worn out and then if I'm home by myself
Total quiet, not even music playing, just quiet.
I can feel that battery charging back up.
It's like, "Oh yeah, this is the stuff."
The irony is that the job that I do now, my jobby job,
I have to go and meet new people all the time
and talk to strangers and get to know them.
And so that is just like, I'm okay now,
but I do know that if I have to do a lot of that
in one week, by the end of it, it's like,
"Oh man, I'm out."
- And that's probably improved things for you as well.
Like you were saying. Yeah, yeah, like anything you do it enough you get practice you get better at it. Yeah for me
it's if I have to
See people be around people
Think about people
Exists within the same confines as people pretty much just those areas are
debilitating life in general and mostly work have ruined that and
fixed all that because for work, I mean it would be you know, go
stand on a stage and give a two and a half hour talk to 10,000 people and it's like
Nothing will snap you out of that faster than that. I still feel like whenever I do stuff like that, though
I feel like as soon as I get up onto a stage I black out
Give the entire talk and at the very end I just kind of like wake up and it's over
So and it's worked really well so far. And you survived. Yeah, I'm still there. So I did find another one that made me mad though
If I could add one more. Oh, yeah
Status seeking the last thing I want to do is be noticed. This was so high. I don't I don't know
I don't agree with this at all
Mmm. Oh, it was 77% by the wolf. Hi like that's
Huge you it basically is saying you're the kind of person that wants, you know, 10,000 likes on your I
Don't have any serve
You see services anymore that have likes but let's say I was on Twitter and it would be like, you know
You want to have 10,000 followers or whatever?
No, I'm one of those people who says they don't care about what others think but really secretly I very much do
So I don't really care about likes and all that thing like Jason said with social media
and I don't even though I'm quite extroverted and I get a
Rush from positive feedback in a group and particularly when people laugh at what I say if people laugh at what I say
There we go Andrew for the visceral reaction, oh, there we go
but yeah, I don't seek to show off or
improve my status and obsess over my self-image, but
But if there's a compliment or praise to be given,
whew, so yeah, not so closeted status seeker.
- We've all done a million of these surveys before,
and the good news is as part of the Hemispheric Views
new corporate plan, we will be doing these annually.
So we'll be able to do a, we'll be able to A/B test ourselves
and look for ways that we've improved as people
and as a team.
- I cannot wait.
- So yes, don't forget, keep this, save that PDF, Martin.
Save your login, Jason.
(upbeat music)
- Media Corner.
Media, media, media corner.
I'm gonna do music this time.
It's a, I guess a group, yeah, group.
It's two gentlemen, I believe.
And what they do is they take predominantly music from games and jazz them up.
And by jazz them up, I mean turn them into jazz songs, basically.
So they're called gentle love is what they go by when they collaborate on these things.
And the majority of them are called prescription for sleep.
And then it'll be colon, like whatever the game is.
So there's one for Celeste, there's one called Lullabies of Mana, there's another one coming
out pretty soon that's for Stardew Valley.
Even if you don't care about video game music or think you like it, I would absolutely say
go into your music thing of choice.
I'm sure they all have it.
I am looking at it in Apple Music right now.
And give it a listen.
I think you'll find pretty quickly if it's your thing or not, but it's just it's nice
music to there's no words.
It's just kind of background music to have going in the house when you're, you know,
doing whatever really.
I'm all about it now.
I just have this thing playing like 24/7.
And there's I think like four or five albums at this point.
And the Stardew Valley one is coming out.
I want to say mid month this month.
So yeah, check it out.
There's like Shovel Knight.
There's one that's kind of a compilation of different game songs.
Undertale is on there.
Really cool, really nice just music to have going.
Yeah, check it out.
So was this delivered to you algorithmically or by personal recommendation or was it that
cool new tool that's come out called iTunes Genius?
I came across it in, I think it was actually my RSS feed from somewhere.
I'm not sure where, but it was something game related and it was about the
Stardew Valley one that's coming out in the next month or so, and I was like,
Oh, that sounds cool.
So I went and looked for it to play it and found it on Bandcamp.
And then from there searched, then found that other albums and then I've landed
on Apple Music and it was like, do I have it already?
Because so many times I will find something like that
and just Insta buy it and then find out
that I quote, already have it via something else
I'm paying for.
So this time, one of the rare times I was smart enough
to go search first in Apple Music to see if I had it.
And I did.
Yeah, there you go.
Gentle Love Prescription for Sleep.
There's six or so albums on there.
- Cool pick, very good.
What have you got, Martin?
Normally there's a story attached.
It's not a super interesting story, but I'm going to tell it anyway.
Quite often in this very study in which I'm sitting, I'll just walk in if I have a spare
moment and stare at my bookshelf.
Right.
Natasha and I share these bookshelves against the wall.
I've read most of the books, but sometimes I just stare at the books that I want to read
that I haven't had time to read and feel this sense of woe and dread and, you know, what
if I had the time to read those books?
But then I move slightly to the left or the right, I avert my gaze and I discover something
that I loved and have already read.
And I did exactly that earlier today and I wanted to share a text with you that I recommend
everyone should read and it kind of matches up with my warped sense of humor.
Have you heard of Mulvaney a land untouched by modern dentistry?
I mean I've read it four times but no, tell us about it as though I have not read it already.
Okay so this book is the first in what was known as the Jet Lag Travel series, Jet Lag Travel Guides.
I got this in high school and absolutely loved it. I remember taking it in the car with me sometimes
to, you know, like if my sister had soccer lessons or soccer practice or something I got sick of
watching I would read this book. It's written by Santa Chalauro, Tom Gleisner and Rob Sitch.
Australians might know some of those guys and they're linked to some of the
people who did things like the TV series Frontline in Australia, even things like
that Baja series on the Late Show, Crackerjack, a lot of these guys have
crossover. Anyway getting back to it the Jetlag travel series is a completely
fake travel series. These are made-up travel guides about countries that do
not exist and what I love about it is that not only is it hilarious but if you
look through the book, right, beautifully done spreads, color-coded recommendations,
sites to visit, the whole lot, and it's completely made up.
And this first one, Molvania, is this kind of like, it might even be pre-Borat or around
the time of Borat, yeah, first published in 2003.
There you go.
So I was just finishing primary school when this came out.
You're so young.
Yeah.
like a made up former Soviet hellhole. And it's great. Like if I just read here, the
description is, "Molvania, a land untouched by modern dentistry, is the definitive guide
to one of Eastern Europe's most overlooked destinations. Once known only by war historians
and Soviet drug runners, this landlocked republic is now finally being discovered by the discerning
traveler. And this latest jet lag travel guide offers all you need to know about getting
you're getting around and safely escaping the forgotten jewel that is
Mulvaney up and it's just brilliant and you get photos like this really unhappy
guy playing a piano accordion reminds me of every Macedonian wedding that I've
attended you even get to learn about places like the best place to dine on a
budget or health alerts about bed bugs so honestly check it out jet lag travel
guide if you're not as into the pre sorry post-soviet era thing as I am I
I have the other two up there. There's Fake Tan, which is a fake Southeast Asian country, and San Sombrero
Which is like a made-up Central American place. So check it out. That's my recommendation for today
So how many of those did they make? I think there were three
But if you actually look inside the cover, this is how much they made up. They actually made up that they did further ones
So you've got, there is San Sombrero, which they ended up doing, but they had Taki Tiki, Bongo Swana,
Tofu Islands
Mustache is done and the syphilis straits
So they just used to make up all of these ridiculous places and the effort they've even made up phone numbers addresses everything
That's impressive. Thank you. I'll leave that with you next time. I go to Wollongong
I'm gonna stop by your little library and read that book at this stage. How do you even know?
Well, I'm gone is real. I still don't believe that it is
Could just be made up. Well, I've got a very quick media corner. I won't waste much of people's times
It's very simple TV series streaming here on Amazon Prime
That doesn't mean it's on Amazon Prime anywhere else, but it is Star Trek Lower Decks
Alright, it's it's an official Star Trek
Property, so it's got the Gene Roddenberry
Stamp of approval on it, but it's animated and each one runs for 30 minutes Star Trek usually focuses on the captain
and the crew on the bridge and all the important people on the ship.
This one, by its very name, Lower Decks, focuses on the less famous people.
The tradies!
The red shirts.
Klebs.
Yeah, the people that have to clean up the messes and do the unglamorous things.
It's a comedy.
It's a comedy Star Trek.
It is really good and because it's got all the official licensing, they can use all the
different characters and that kind of thing.
They make fun of themselves, but they don't overdo it.
So it's not a complete piss-take of Star Trek, so it's still in the world of Star Trek, but
they kind of make some gags along the way about the older ones.
But the quality of the writing and the acting, it's just fantastic.
Highly highly recommend it.
It doesn't take long to work through the season.
I think it's 10 episodes.
I don't think you need to be a Trekkie to really like it.
Are there any episodes where they take a personality test to see how they better can work together? No
Damn not
season two
So just can I tie two things together you said animated series earlier you talked about matrix
I'm just gonna throw out the animatrix as well as another thing. I love pretty damn cool from like
2000-something it was 2003 it was in the matrix universe
But it was like I think it was two or three
like sub
Little mini animated movies that were kind of basically it was nine was it nine. Holy crap. Yeah
Wow, sorry to take over your recommendation. Can you know? No, that's fit
I just vaguely you said matrix earlier and then you just said animated and it was like popped it back into my head
I haven't seen it and probably since when it came out in 2003
But I remember it being very cool and just very different in terms of what it was
So I I'm gonna recommend it having not seen it in a long time
It's well worth watching if anyone hasn't seen it because it was just to extend what you said
It was kind of used as an expansion of the matrix universe, but also a promotional tool for the matrix reloaded
So one of the films the short films was final flight of the Osiris
which shows what happens before the Matrix reloaded to enable them to discover that the
machines are digging to destroy the city of Zion. There's also a two-part animated short
called The Second Renaissance which gives you the entire history of the machine wars
and the downfall of humanity that led to the creation of the Matrix. And then there are side
stories of different exceptional beings that release themselves from the system.
Well, I've just looked and it's in my Plex library.
So anyone that is in the correct Patreon tier and has access to my Plex library can watch it.
That's not necessarily a scalable tier.
Actually, you're on a gigabit ethernet.
You're fine.
I got fiber.
We're good.
Bring it on.
Just don't connect to Martin's Plex server.
You might have more troubles.
Yeah, that's all that needs to be said.
Do you remember RealPlayer?
It's getting video from Martin, it's a bit like watching real video.
I think that's generous, isn't it?
(laughing)
