AOL is new and improved.

- Oh my goodness.

What is that?

- I am switching ISPs to America online.

- Okay.

- Because I now have the new and improved version 2.7.

It is both free and fun.

50 free hours, best offer yet for Macintosh version 2.7.

- Wow.

- I feel like the time is now.

I want to get an early on this new information super highway.

So I think I'm going to dive into the world of AOL

because it's the world's most popular

internet online service.

What do you both think about that?

Do you think that's a wise move in 2024?

- I mean, GongNet is pretty formidable,

but I'd be willing to move to something

if it's fun and free.

- Yeah, for 50 hours.

50 hours.

So our type 45 may have to get reduced

'cause I only have 50 hours now,

but I'm intrigued to see what it's like

to use AOL on a floppy disk.

There are thousands of exclusive areas.

Yeah.

- It's not on a CD.

It's a floppy disk.

- No, it's a floppy.

- Okay.

- I think that's compatible with Sonoma.

I'm pretty sure.

- What about CompuServe?

Do you have one of those?

- I don't have one of those.

No, I just have the America online.

I could try, I could maybe do a, like a segment.

I could do a comparison, a compare and contrast,

if you will, with a checkbox cheat.

To be fair, because I live in Australia,

I never got to experience America online.

- No, you probably didn't.

- I actually don't know.

I don't know what it really is.

Some sort of ISP, but it seems like not really an ISP.

It's like a walled garden ISP.

- I don't know if either of you remember this,

but I do feel like I recall that AOL was in fact in Australia

as Australia online.

- Okay.

- Yeah, 'cause they were like, we're already called AOL.

Are there any other A countries

that we could try to expand into?

- Australia online?

- Yeah, I think that was it.

They're like, well, Australia is an option.

Let's give that a go.

- I think Algeria online came before America online,

yeah, alphabetically and chronologically.

- I'm hoping you can find an Australia online disc

from back in the day.

That would be great if you could do that.

And I'll send you an America online version.

You send me an Australia online version.

- Okay.

- And that just really, I think that would be a good thing

for us to bridge the gap between the two atmospheres.

(upbeat music)

- Now, this is shocking.

Normally it's only Andrew's a something guy,

but we've got, I'm a range finder guy.

Jason, you're a guy now.

- I've decided that it's very,

like the waiting of the I'm a X guy

has been really heavily weighted

in the Andrew Canyon bucket.

- That is true.

- There's not a lot of stuff in the Feld bucket either,

but I felt like if he could be all these guys,

surely we can be something, right?

So I've decided that I'm gonna be a range finder guy

'cause I don't think there's gonna be overlap there.

So I don't think there'll be like legal issues

that we have to work out or anything.

And I just kind of wanted to try it out,

try to see how it fit me.

So I am now a range finder guy in the form of taking photos.

I've been doing the range finder thing for a few weeks now,

and I absolutely love it.

It's a lot of fun,

and it's just like a new skill that I have to hone

that I'm not good at, and I really enjoy that.

So I am now in the guy bucket.

- Just to define for people who aren't as familiar

with the camera terms,

what is the difference when it comes to a range finder?

- Good point, good point.

So you have something like a SLR camera

where you look through the viewfinder,

there's mirrors,

and you're looking directly through the lens.

Okay, there's all of the mirrorless cameras,

which by definition don't have mirrors.

So you're effectively looking from the sensor view

through the lens.

Range finder, totally different.

Back from the dawn of cameras,

you're looking through a little window

that has absolutely nothing to do

with what the lens is seeing at all.

And then there's a separate optic

that you're lining up with what you're looking through

to get focus, and then you're taking a photo.

In the range finder, you have what's called frame lines,

which are effectively what the lens is seeing,

but really you're looking at something,

the lens is looking at something,

and you're sort of making them all work together.

So it's a very old, old version of photography.

It's a hundred percent manual focus.

There is no auto focus, so sorry.

Everything you do is a hundred percent manual,

and it can be frustrating,

but I'm finding it to be a lot of fun.

So range finder guy.

- Why would anybody want that?

Why would you want that?

- I don't see the upside.

- Oh, Andrew.

- Oh, oh.

- Oh, Andrew.

- Oh my goodness.

(laughing)

- What are you getting into?

- Why is anything anything?

- Oh boy.

- We don't need, we've got a tight 30 today.

I don't want to, I don't want to a hundred percent

hijack this into photography corner,

but I'm more than happy when we go back

to a tight 45 format to burn those extra 15 minutes

talking about.

- Can I offer?

I think it's, yeah.

- I'm saying it quickly within this tight 30 that we have.

It's a different kind of photography.

It's a slow photography.

You're walking around, you're observing,

you're manually focusing.

It's not chasing wildlife or journalism.

It's a different kind of thing.

And I know you said I haven't yet identified myself

as a what guy.

I would now call myself, I think it's been long enough

that I'm a micro four thirds guy.

I'm going to take that label.

- Definitely.

- Okay.

- Yeah.

- You're a range finder guy, I'm micro four thirds guy.

And I'm out there zipping around, you know,

chasing a kid or birds or whatever.

Jason is approaching the world differently.

The range finder is, it's like this premium,

like modern rebirth of this older thing.

Am I right?

'Cause we're talking about a Leica here.

This is a Leica journey.

It's like the Porsche that keeps getting refined

into these futuristic versions.

- It's true.

- Yeah.

- It's a different idea.

- Yeah.

- Okay.

- So there you go.

- I'm sure there'll be much more.

- You can still talk about it more in the future,

but that's my little contextualization.

- So have you set up your slash guy page on your website?

- I have not yet.

No, I didn't really.

This is a very new revelation in my life.

So I've not popped open the old text editor

to get that going, but I'll get right on it.

- Okay, good.

- Pressure is on.

Pressure is on.

- Yeah.

Full credit to Katie.blog/guy.

- Okay.

Range finder.

- That does work now, right?

I'm not sending people to a 404 anymore.

- Pretty certain that works.

- Okay.

Okay.

Just checking.

- We'll find out soon in the show notes, that's for sure.

(upbeat music)

- I've been instructed by Andrew's note here

with the basketball,

"Fire up the depreciation spreadsheet,

Canyon went shopping."

I don't have one personally,

so you're talking about your own, right, Andrew?

- Oh, absolutely.

- I'm glad that our streak of like

every consecutive episode

with depreciation spreadsheet mention is being maintained.

- Yeah.

- Well, of course.

- I think.

- So just, we can't mention YNAB anymore,

so I've got to mention some other financial product.

Sorry, Jason, you're gonna have to link to it now.

- Yeah.

(laughing)

We said we were gonna stop linking to them,

but I'm kind of pretty sure

we're never gonna stop linking to them.

(laughing)

- So I went away for a week to Sydney recently,

as you know, I saw Martin.

- What?

- That was fun.

- When can we hear about that?

- Previous episode.

- Oh, okay.

- Look back in your podcast feed.

- 115.

- What was bad about that was I got home from Sydney

only to discover that my HomePod OG had died.

- RIP.

- So clearly it being ignored for a week,

it just, it would not turn on, just totally dead.

So I was like, ah, what a bummer, but that's all right.

I will not resist, I don't need one.

Well, it turns out I do need one.

(laughing)

I lasted about 10 days without having a HomePod.

I just need that readily accessible music.

And I thought about maybe buying a Sonos instead,

but nah, I didn't do that.

I'm like, I'm an Apple guy, why am I messing around?

So I ordered a HomePod second generation

from the refurb store that will be with me hopefully.

- The big one.

- Yeah, yeah, hopefully tomorrow.

But so I just wanna give, you know,

pull one out for the OG HomePod.

Acquisition date, 26th of April, 2018.

Disposal date, 8th of July, 2024.

Life of service, 324 weeks.

I paid $499 for it, got nothing back for it in resale value,

which calculates to a HomePod cost

of $1.54 per week of ownership.

- That's a steal, pretty good.

- So I think that's okay.

People complain about the HomePod being too expensive,

but I would be willing to drop $1.54 a week to utilize it.

- Two questions.

One, did you consider an iPod Hi-Fi?

- Yeah, good question.

- No, I did not.

- Okay. - No, I did not.

- Two, have you taken that HomePod to the HomePod store

and said, "Hey, can you make sure this is like legit dead?"

- No, I have not.

- Okay. - Couldn't be bothered.

- Just asking, maybe, might be worth doing.

- Figured it's out of warranty.

It's out of warranty, it's considered, what,

a vintage model now.

Eh, what are they gonna do?

- I don't know, a little store.

- Did you try plugging in those yellow, white,

and red cables in the back, you know?

(laughing)

You know those ones?

- Yeah, I know the ones.

- I don't know, the right genius may just say like,

"Oh yeah, we just gotta boop, boop, boop,

"and it's fine now, and maybe now you have two HomePods."

I mean, instead of just chucking it in the bin, eh?

- Maybe I'll try that.

I might try it if I'm bored.

I just don't wanna be sitting around

at a bloody genius bar for three hours.

- Mate, have a look.

- And just another little shopping update.

I also decided to order myself new AirPod Pros.

- Wow, you're just, money is just out the door.

Just, whew.

- I got excited, I got excited.

- You're an audio guy now.

- So AirPods Pro, the new ones haven't arrived yet.

I got 'em on a Prime Day sale,

so they're taking a bit longer to arrive.

Eh, it's fine.

So at the moment, just wanna say,

at the moment my AirPod Pro originals

are running at $2.01 per week.

So a little bit more expensive than the HomePod.

- Do you think we could get that down sub two?

You think that's possible?

- Well, what I'm wondering, if maybe when I get the new ones

I don't actually just get rid of the old ones.

I keep them in two separate places

and then I've got concurrency

and then they'll just keep on bringing that price down.

- I personally would love to see that sub two.

I just.

- Well, look, $2.01, I reckon I've got it in me.

I can do this, Jason.

- If anyone can make it happen, you can.

- Thanks, man. - Yeah.

- I should really put this live online somewhere

so everybody can load it up and just look at it.

- It should be, yeah.

Like a live updated website

where as soon as you make a transaction change,

auto update, just ready to go.

Twitch stream, really, it should be probably a Twitch stream.

Just gonna throw that out there.

- Yeah, and whether you like it or not or ask,

Jason's gonna check the uptime, so good.

- Yeah, oh yeah. - That's true.

- I will report back that your site is down.

- LinkedIn, is that a service

or is that like a made up gerund noun

for the act of being on LinkedIn?

LinkedIn, I don't know what I'm reading here.

- Linky dinks?

You may be familiar with the old service, Delicious,

also pinboard.io, you may be familiar with that one.

- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

- Basically bookmarking services.

- Yep.

- And essentially it's a clone

of one of those bookmarking apps,

but it's your own self-hosted instance.

And I just wanna say it's pretty good.

And it's a nice way to sort of save links

and get back to them later, bookmark manager, old school.

And so I like it, I'm using it, it's fun.

That's all I really wanted to say.

- So I'm always impressed with David H

that he has this copious record of links

that he can just pull from.

I think he uses Good Links on iOS.

I also have that,

but that's more of like a read it later service as well.

I just want pure bookmarking for some reason.

So I'm using LinkedIn, we'll see how long it lasts.

- Now this is interesting, past a follow-up.

I love that the poll was run, this is fantastic.

Interesting results.

I think Jason should speak to this.

- Well.

- It's not about being right or wrong,

it's about the diversity of our listenership

and it's overwhelming preference for a certain option.

- There's been further follow-ups since also.

So we ran a poll, episode 115,

we talked about pasta twirling.

It's probably, I doubt there's any topic in the world

that was more talked about than that

in the given time span since episode 115.

And so we ran a poll of when you're doing pasta twirling,

are you clockwise, counterclockwise, or shovel?

Right?

Just to, you know, put all the options out there.

Overwhelmingly 81% clockwise with a star on that,

because there were some instances

that we've heard about afterwards

where people voted in one way.

So it was 8% counterclockwise, I'll say.

But there are people that voted counterclockwise

that then came back later and said,

actually, I'm clockwise.

So from my account that I've been keeping separately

in my copious notes, I am still the only person

that is actually bona fide counterclockwise

in the universe from what I can tell.

And this is with additional votes from people

that I ask everyone I run into now

in a day-to-day situation.

Clockwise, counterclockwise, pasta twirling, which are you?

Like that's the hot button topic.

Every single person clockwise, every time without fault.

- Well, I'll tell you what,

I brought this up at a wedding

that Natasha and I went to yesterday,

and that you do the anti or counterclockwise turn, Jason.

And they were shocked, not negatively,

but like, wow, we hadn't thought of this.

And actually we're all clockwise.

So you are pretty unique.

You've got your own like highly localized

Coriolis effect pasta thing going.

And then after this poll finished,

I realised, oh, I should have mentioned this,

but I'll bring it up on the show now.

You've got the shovel option, right?

But then Natasha is actually a person

who cuts the pasta. - A cutter, yeah.

- Like when it comes to spaghetti

or longer noodle style pastas.

And then that's not really a shovel, is it?

That's another option.

So I feel like we've got these little unique edge cases

floating out there.

If you are listening or discovering us online

or Mastodon or whatever, and you see this,

please tell us if you have other weird pasta habits.

- Yeah, and there were more choppers

that came out of the woodworks

after that was posted by her.

So she was not alone.

- I'm not comfortable with, you should not chop pasta.

It's disrespectful to the pasta.

- Well, you know, I could say the same

about you clockwise folks.

I could say that that's just disrespectful,

but you know, we all do our own thing.

So. - Well, look, eventually,

you know, when the inevitable hemispheric views,

you know, global world, you know,

kind of live tour thing happens and we land in Italy,

we'll speak to the people on the streets

and see what they think.

- And then we'll all get one big bowl of pasta.

We'll all twirl from it

and it will be the same noodle somehow.

And then we'll do the thing where we just start eating it

and then our noses touch.

It's gonna be great.

- Ah, lady and the tramp.

- Yeah, it'll be great. - Not weird at all.

- Somehow three of us have one noodle.

- Who's the tramp?

- Probably somebody that's clockwise would be my guess,

but I don't know, we'll see.

- Now this is pretty fascinating, leaving pasta corner,

CMF Phone One.

This is a special chat, Jason.

You've actually done like a Vox Pop,

not pasta related, but phone related.

What's going on?

- I chatted with Lee, a listener of the show

about the CMF One phone, 'cause we both have one.

It is the sub-brand of nothing, the nothing phone,

which is a weird name.

- It just sounds funny when you say it that way.

The sub-brand of nothing is extra nothing.

Smaller nothing.

- Yeah, nothing is a phone manufacturer.

They have a sub-brand called CMF,

which is like their budget phone.

And so we chatted about the fact that, you know,

everything's about iPhone versus Android all the time.

But like, what do you get from a phone that is,

it's $200.

So 200 USD, it was like 179 pounds for him, whatever.

You know, call it 200 bucks as a phone.

Compared to, you know, the phone that I use every day,

which is like $1,200.

Like what does a thousand dollar gap

in phones look like in 2024?

And it was just like,

it was an interesting time to just talk to somebody about

not iPhone stuff.

I mean, we still touched on like differences

and comparisons, of course,

but like, what do you get from a $200 phone in 2024?

It's a really, really good device,

especially considering it's $200.

But it was just an interesting chat

to talk to somebody about non-iPhone, non-iOS,

non-Mac, non-Apple stuff, and what we thought about it.

So yeah, a little side chat there.

- Well, let's cut to this special audio interview

for this very unique listener corner.

(imitates audio)

- Thank you for jumping on to talk CMF one,

no, CMF phone one by nothing.

Yeah, the sub-brand of nothing is my understanding.

- I didn't even know they had a sub-brand

when this whole thing happened,

or is this the beginning of it?

I don't know.

I should preface this by I am not in the Android world.

I think everybody probably knows that.

So this is kind of my first foray into that.

- I'm obviously primarily iPhone too.

I've doubled with Android here and there,

but I had the original nothing phone one.

I just love that design, the clear back and the glyphs,

you know, the lights on the back

that has kind of limited usage.

- Those lights, those were really cool.

- I'll tell you what, there was the only phone

that I've ever had someone out ask me what it was.

(laughs)

I was testing it alongside the iPhone

I was just out on, I live in like a rural area.

So it's a lot of like, you know, countryside walks and stuff

and someone was walking their dog and they were like,

what the hell is that?

And they were like asking me about it.

And they were actually a OnePlus.

They came from like OnePlus.

And the guy that founded nothing actually founded OnePlus.

I think Carl Pei is the founder of nothing.

He founded OnePlus, you know,

until they got sold off, I guess.

The UK is probably more of a 50/50, I would say,

between Android and iPhone

in terms of what you see out and about.

Mainly Samsung over here.

- Yeah.

- You see a very few kind of, you see pixels occasionally,

but most of what you see here is Samsung.

And then iPhone, you're just looking at the number of lenses

on the back of it to see which one it is.

But CMF is obviously their budget line,

which has taken the same design kind of ethos,

which is driven by Teenage Engineering,

who are on their board as well.

They helped design the first phone.

So they're trying to bring that design ethos

down to a lower price bracket.

I think aimed at Asia and some of the places

where there's Android phones everywhere.

And they've been out for a while.

I mean, they had the phone,

the watch was the first thing they had.

They had watches and earbuds, you know.

And then this is the first phone they've done.

You know, the CMF phone one is the first one.

- Right.

So you said you're using an iPhone now.

What phone were you using prior to picking this up?

- So prior to picking up this one, I'm on a 15, 15 Pro.

- 15 Pro, okay.

- And then before that, I had a Moto Razr.

- Yes.

- Which was my other dabbling to Android

'cause I wanted to try the foldable form factor.

- When you did that, I was like in this,

I think I probably had one in the cart at that point

because I was very intrigued by it.

It was like, it just--

- They're cool.

- It was something different.

I'm not necessarily like, oh, my phone should fold,

but I just kind of wanted to know.

I felt like that fold maybe was better than the other fold.

I don't know.

Like what was it, taco and hamburger

or whatever the hell people call it.

- They're too big.

They're too big, those ones that fold like a book or whatever.

- Yeah, 'cause you're effectively now,

it's just two phones like stuck together

and that's not really--

- Yeah.

- I never have the issue where I'm out with a mobile device

and thinking, boy, if I just had a tablet right now,

like that's just not a thing for me.

- No.

- It's meant to be just a small screen

that I can kind of do things if I need to.

But I mean, if it works for you, great.

But that never was appealing to me.

But for something about that Razer one,

I have to imagine there's like a piece in my brain somewhere

where it's just nostalgia for the Razer brand as well

from like way back in the day.

- Yeah, I had one of the original ones.

I mean, ultimately why I returned that one

was down to privacy, to be honest.

It was, as I do, like a lot of us restoring phones,

backing up, trying different phones all the time.

And I was delving, not delving in,

but I was waiting for something to set up.

So I was just reading the privacy policy.

And this thing's like, we train our AI on your data

and you can't opt out of it.

And they sell stuff to third parties as well and all that.

And I was like, right, I'm done.

I'm in the return window, I'll just return it

and go back to my boring looking iPhone, I guess.

- Yeah, I mean, when there's nothing more personal

than your phone, that's like the last thing you want people

just doing whatever they want with it whenever they want.

- Yeah, that put me right off that phone.

- Well, good, I'm glad you were able to do that

and I didn't have to, so thank you.

(laughing)

- Yeah, safety of return at least anyway.

The hassle of going to the post office

or whatever, you know, to return it.

- So why the CMF then?

So what was the, you did the Razr

and we know we got rid of that,

but then, so you're back on 15 Pro.

- I'm on a 15 Pro again.

- Then this happens.

- I'm on a 15 Pro again now, actually.

- What was?

- I've got, I've said.

- Oh, okay.

- Dueling, you know what it's like, like you are.

I can see you've got it in your hand there.

So CMF for me, it was a design.

I love teenage engineering and it was the design,

it was their approach in terms of bringing good design

down to a lower cost.

It was having an Android phone to mess around with,

you know, getting, you know, being,

I think it's good to have, if you can, is have both.

Not so much to daily carry both,

but just to understand the ecosystem of it.

But again, it was color, design,

and it was the functionality of being able

to put the things on the back to turn it into a stand

or to turn it into, you know,

I thought when I saw the pictures originally,

it was a power pack on the back,

but it's like a wallet, you know,

it's like a wallet there.

- Yeah, I thought the same thing.

It looked like it was like a battery thing.

Like the old, when Apple used to make a case

that had that like kind of bulge in the back,

it looked similar.

- It's a nice object.

And I knew kind of going in that I'd struggled

to make it my main phone just because of, you know,

with RCS, you know, a support on iPhone,

that makes things a little easier.

But for me, the main reason I love smartphones

and iPhones specifically is the camera.

So I knew as much as I loved the design,

I'd be doing them for a bit.

And that's what I've been doing.

But yeah, it was the design and the approach for me.

179 pounds, you know, or I'm not sure in dollars

how much that is at the moment.

- It was 199.

- Yeah, and it's just unbelievable for that.

- Yeah, I think design was obviously the play here.

Like this spec wise, like it's fine.

And we can talk about that too, I guess.

But like, you know, from, so even just like,

if we back all the way up to like the unboxing,

like the design of the packaging,

I thought was good and thoughtful.

You know, it is the first thing you see.

So it's packaging that gets arguably chucked,

but I think it's still important

that you have a nice presentation that when you open it,

the phone comes out nicely.

And it's not like you're trying to dig through

like 50 layers of plastic to get the phone out.

You know, it comes with nothing.

- Did you see the ejector tool, the little ejector tool?

- Yes, so yeah, you get one USB-C cable

and then you get the little SIM ejector tool.

- Yeah.

- Which I think people could probably complain about,

but like, if you're really gonna like look at the landscape,

you know, the phone I have that I normally use,

the iPhone 15 Pro Max, it is $1,200

and it comes with the same thing.

- Exactly, yeah.

- That's not a big deal, I don't think at all.

But yeah, the design, I'm just shocked

that there's been a number of devices recently

that are designed by or in collaboration with,

or somehow affiliated with Teenage Engineering.

- Yeah.

- Which generally when you look at Teenage Engineering stuff

like it's pretty costly stuff.

I mean, it's very nice, it's a warranted cost I think,

'cause it's a well-made thing.

But you see some of these devices coming out that are,

well, actually the two I'm thinking of,

they're both $200 and they're both designed,

I don't know if it's fully by them

or in collaboration with whatever it is.

- Probably I would say with the CMF stuff.

- Yeah, like they are involved there.

So like there is money changing hands

over to Teenage Engineering for their input

because you know, they're very good at this.

And it's still 200 bucks.

I'm very shocked by that.

- Yeah.

- By the amount of quality and still features

that are in a $200 phone.

- It doesn't feel that price at all.

I mean, what gave it away for me?

No, I wouldn't say gave it away

'cause I don't have much experience

of that price Android phones.

But when I've been out using it,

there's a couple of things which I would,

would frustrate, have frustrated me a bit

and would frustrate me if I used it full time.

One is lack of NFC.

So I can't do tap to pay.

- Okay.

- Or like, I don't know what Google Pay,

there's none of that on there.

So you can't use it.

Low light performance on the camera is pretty dreadful.

- Yeah.

- And I don't know about you,

but I find the fingerprint sensor to be quite unreliable.

And I don't know if it's 'cause I'm used to the stuff.

- I don't think it's you.

I don't think fingerprint sensors are good at all.

I think they're kind of just mid at best.

I had a Pixel phone for testing some stuff for work

and it has a thumbprint one.

And that one is actually worse than this one.

That one I feel like is three out of 10, it'll work.

And I've found on the nothing phone here,

or the phone one,

it's maybe more like 60 or 70% that it works.

And it's fine compared to,

I think when I pick up my iPhone and face ID is like instant

and just works for me.

Like this whole fingerprint reader under the screen,

I had a note that it was just, they are meh.

Like they're just, they're fine.

I guess it's better than a pin code,

except when it doesn't work

and then you have to do a pin code anyway.

So I don't know.

- I still kind of prefer touch ID on iPhone because,

- Okay.

- For me, my daughter's got an SE,

you know, whatever the latest SE is.

And I've used that a couple of times.

And you know, when I, back when I had a seven,

I think was probably the last one I had with the touch.

You could unlock it as you were getting out of your pocket.

Cause you could feel where the button was,

you just put your thumb on it and locks and you're using it.

Whereas there's another step with face ID,

you open it and then you flick.

I mean, it's not a, it's only, you know,

it's not a huge amount of difference,

but with this fingerprint sensor,

because there's no tactile button on it,

you have to look at the phone before you press on it.

I would have much preferred it on the power button

or something like that.

But the screen is unbelievable on it for that price again,

that 6.7 inch, which looks, I mean,

it doesn't look as kind of saturated as the iPhone one does.

I've got, I've obviously not got the Pro Max,

which that is more equivalent of, you know,

I think that phone is actually bigger than a Pro Max.

- It's, it is.

Yeah. It's actually, like,

I didn't think I could have a phone bigger than that,

but yeah, here we are.

It's actually bigger. Yeah.

- There's nothing in it that says it's that price.

I mean, I don't know how they're,

whether they're making a loss on them, I'm not sure,

but that's the biggest takeaway for me

in terms of being impressed with these,

obviously the design, but it's that screen.

It's, it's obviously not,

it doesn't look as saturated as the iPhone does.

It looked, to me, it looked a little bit washed out,

but it's impressive.

It's, it's an impressive device for that money.

- From a hardware standpoint, I felt like it is,

you know, there's, there's little things we can nitpick at

of like, you know, no NFC, things like that, or, you know,

no wireless charging.

Most of those things are kind of nice to have,

but it feels like this phone is more than enough phone

for like 90% of people that are not tech enthusiasts,

that are not, like, this is actually something

that is a really good device for everyone

'cause it's 200 bucks, you know?

And yes, I know it's not technically for everyone,

but compared to a $1,200 phone, like.

- Yeah.

- I would, I would struggle to say that my iPhone is,

is six times as good as this.

- Yeah, I agree.

- Well, if we had an affiliate code, I would put it here

so everyone could go buy a CMF1 phone.

- Yes.

Yeah, I might have to.

Yeah, no, I appreciate, I appreciate you setting this up

'cause it's, like you said,

it's good to chat to somebody about it.

- Yeah, thanks, Lee.

Absolutely.

(mimics air horn)

- Well, thanks for including that, Jason.

I like this listen to corner thing,

incorporating people a bit more

'cause people spend their time listening to us,

but maybe we should listen to them sometimes.

They've got things to say.

- Well put.

(upbeat music)

- Now, recently I started this new segment

called Counter Chat.

- Counter Chat.

- You know, I talk to people at counters quite a bit,

but it seems that someone else has branched out

this episode.

I'm seeing a basketball.

Andrew.

- Yep.

- Have you had a successful counter chat?

What happened?

- I have, and it was, it's, it's sort of a counter chat,

but sort of with another customer

rather than a staff member.

- Ooh.

- And it wasn't exactly at the counter.

It was at the meat section.

- Okay.

- Is that okay?

Is that still qualified?

- That's technically a counter.

- That's true.

It's true.

It's like shelf.

- It's the meat counter.

- Yeah, yeah.

Meat count, meat, meat counter chat.

- Yeah, I think that's fine.

- Okay.

So I don't know how it works in other supermarkets.

- Like you need permission.

Nope, sorry.

That doesn't, doesn't make the cut.

We don't, we don't want to hear your story.

(laughs)

- All right.

Generally in Perth,

people don't talk to each other in supermarkets.

You keep to yourself, you run your own show,

you're doing your lists.

I was looking at meats.

I was trying to start finding the particular meat

I was looking for.

And I heard a lady next to me saying to her husband,

I presume, "Where's the rump steak?

I can't find the rump steak."

And I was like, "Oh, okay.

I'll just let them find it."

And then she's like, "I can't see it anywhere."

And I looked straight up and there was the rump steak,

top shelf.

And I said, "Oh, excuse me.

You're looking for the rump steak?

It's just there."

And she's like, "Oh, of course I couldn't see it."

Because she was about five foot two

and it was like above her eye line.

- Tall guy.

- So she missed it.

And I said, I was like,

"Oh, that's the one thing that I come in handy for

being six three or whatever.

I can see these things.

That's one of my limited uses

is helping people find meat on high shelves."

- Yeah.

When I think, "Where's rump steak?"

Andrew's my guy for that.

- Yeah.

And so I was like, "There you go.

Have a nice day.

I hope you enjoy it."

And she was like, "Oh, thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you."

That was very kind of me.

And we sort of had a laugh about heights

and carried on our merry way.

So just a small anecdote,

but evidence going to show that you can create

a counter chat situation in any environment.

You just have to stay a little bit aware

and a little bit willing to go outside your comfort zone.

So that's my little story.

Counter chat, customer version.

- Bringing people together.

You're putting the community back into grocery shopping.

I love it.

- Yeah.

Like nobody wants to be an outie.

We all hate it.

So let's bring some happiness and joy.

And then later on, I actually,

I was trying to steer around somebody

and I accidentally bumped a lady's basket

as I was trying to steer my trolley.

Totally, like totally incident.

I didn't mean to do it.

I wasn't being angry or anything.

And I was like, "Oh, I'm sorry."

And she gave me the dirtiest look

like I had absolutely just run her over at full speed.

And I said, "I'm really sorry."

And she just followed me with beady eyes, like evil.

And I was like, "Whoa, whoa."

So that somewhat brought down my happiness

from the earlier customer counter chat.

- So that was not a counter chat.

- Well, look, we're here to support you.

- Okay.

- Can't win them all.

- That was a basket case, that one.

(laughing)

- Thanks Andrew for laughing.

Jason looks like he's in pain.

(laughing)

- I just stopped recording

whenever those things happen at this point.

(laughing)

(upbeat music)

- Well, Jason, you did really well for being drunk.

You did really well.

- Thank you.

Appreciate that.

- Congratulations.

- Yeah, I feel great.

(laughing)

- All right, count us down.

- And three, two, one, stop.

(beeping)
