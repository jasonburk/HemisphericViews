[intro music]

Well, welcome to episode 117.

No big deal.

Just a normal, average, every other Fortnite episode.

Except it's not because we have guests on the show today.

Normally there are three.

Today there are four.

No, five.

Five people on one show.

Good luck whoever's editing this week.

I am sorry for that.

Oh, I think it's Martin.

It looks like...

No, it's Andrew.

Oh, is it Andrew?

Lucky me.

Oh, you scored.

You scored.

Well, guests, who do we have today?

Hmm.

Who could it be?

One of the greatest other podcasters in the world, Kate and Megan from Not Quite Dead.

I think we've talked about them before.

They're both in the Discord.

You know them.

You love them.

Welcome, Kate and Megan.

I will not even try to say the wonderfulness that is your show.

I will leave that to you because I know I don't like doing that, but hopefully one of

you do.

So, Kate and/or Megan, would you love to give a quick synopsis of Not Quite Dead?

Thanks for the intro.

We go deep, but we also like to keep it shallow.

Two gal pals discussing horror movies.

Perfect.

Yep.

It's a great show.

I enjoy it.

I don't really watch a ton of horror movies, but you can now watch it through their eyes,

which is actually perfect because then it's less than two and a half hours and you get

all the good stuff.

So, there you go.

Yeah.

So, thank you, Kate and Megan, for joining us on episode 117, which I think was initially

going to be episode 113 and then maybe 115, possibly 116, and now we're here for 117.

We did it.

Wow.

We got there.

We made it.

We're basically over the finish line already.

Oh, good.

Can I open with a hemispheric question?

I'm noticing- So, Jason, this is a pronunciation issue, north of the hemisphere versus south.

You're saying- Now, let me get this right.

Megan?

This comes up a lot with my name, yeah.

In Australia, we would say Megan.

Megan.

Okay.

What?

Megan.

Yeah, that's the standard pronunciation.

Yeah.

So, I don't want to get it wrong.

I want to represent- Yeah, I want to get it right.

So, can you clarify for us how your name should be said?

I'm fine with any of those pronunciations, honestly.

I always hear, "Is it Megan or is it Megan?"

And now, this is the first time I've heard Megan, and I just sort of chalk it up to different

accents.

Like, I don't care.

They all sound fine to me.

So, you can say it however wrong you want to.

You're good.

It's not Megan, like the Renault.

Don't say Meg-han.

You know, no H in my name.

Okay.

Because I'm going to probably tie it back to a horror thing.

So, I've just finished, finally completed all seasons of The Walking Dead.

Really?

It was- Oh, don't even get me started.

Even I haven't done that.

Oh, it was- I put myself through the pain.

But so, I'm now relating your name to Negan.

Oh, yeah.

So, I'm going Megan Negan.

Yeah.

I'm a bad guy, yeah.

That's where my head's at right now.

It's a good association.

So, how do you guys say Kate then?

Is it Kate?

Or like, what are we doing there?

Oh, God.

Well, it rhymes with mate.

So, you guys should have it in the bag.

Nice.

Well, no, I was going to ask if Andrew had any issues with Kate being spelled with a

C rather than a K, now that we're getting all name issues aside.

Andrew, are you bothered by that?

Or can Kate continue with her spelling?

It is funny you mentioned that because that's what I would have said.

I would have said, well, look, the pronunciation is correct, but the spelling, we need to work

on that.

It really should start with a K.

Andrew, why is your name spelled with double O?

Like what's the EW thing?

Come on, just- Andrew.

Andrew.

The classic double O Andrew spelling.

Oh, my God.

I'll give you my parents' phone numbers.

You can take it up with them.

So now that I've offended both guests, we can carry on with the show.

This is why we have guests so often.

I have a non-hemispheric question, probably more of a curious question.

Now I discovered you two, Kate and Megan, through Jason, obviously.

I am, I'm just going to come out and say, I'm not a horror movie person.

I'm an absolute wuss.

I'm a coward.

And I respect those who can sit through them and enjoy them and not be like filled with

terror for the rest of their lives.

So maybe, I don't know if you want to start, Kate, we'll go alphabetically since we're

on the topic of letters and how we spell things and say things.

How did you two start this podcast?

What brought you together and, you know, why we're sitting here talking about it today?

Probably the worst movie ever, Kate.

Well, Megan and I were co-workers and we bonded over the movie Saw and the Saw franchise,

if you've seen it.

We've seen every one.

We've seen every movie multiple times.

And we would do, you know, movie weekends, we'd hang out, we'd watch these horror movies,

and we would just talk our way through these movies, making fun of them, analyzing them,

sometimes riffing on what our own ideas for adding to the franchise, what that would look

like.

And for years, we were saying, "Man, we should do a podcast because we have a lot of opinions

and we're objectively correct in all of our opinions," which is like the basis of all

podcasts.

And when COVID hit and we're all, you know, inside and thinking of what to do with our

newfound free time, we picked up podcasting.

So we're totally self-taught.

That's why we're so good at it.

Yeah, we just wanted to be able to gab about our favorite things.

Our other podcast was a food show that we did with two other people.

We all ordered takeaway for each other.

We would buddy up and send each other like door dash meals, basically.

And we'd pick a theme for the week, and you got what you got.

And then we would eat it, and then the next day, talk about it and record that.

Yeah.

That got expensive.

So we didn't keep it up.

I completely forgot about that.

Yeah.

It sounded like a horrific pain in the ass.

It was.

Having to order door dash for someone else in a different place and expect it to get

there.

What a logistical nightmare.

And different time zones, because I'm in a different time zone than the rest of them

were at the time.

It was a logistical nightmare.

It was horrifically expensive.

And sometimes you got some of the most disgusting food that you could not believe that someone

paid like $40 to send you.

Fortunately, you make so much money from podcasting, though.

It doesn't really matter because it's just the money just rolls in.

Yeah.

It is a lucrative business.

Actually, I'm going to sidebar for a minute there, because that is a perfect segue, Jason.

And I hope you don't mind, Kate and Megan, if I do this.

We have a program here for our podcast friends called, what's it called, Jason?

You say it best.

OnePridePlus.com.

That is correct.

That's in the long game.

Yes, it is.

And joining us in the long game from this point forward is another name that is challenging

to pronounce correctly.

It's Jacoby.

Or Jacoby Y.

As we usually do it.

Yeah, because-

To not dox them with their entire first and last name.

I'll edit that.

But is it Jacoby Y or is it Jacoby Y?

Or is it Jacoba?

Oh, yeah.

It's definitely Jacoby.

Based on my Twin Peaks knowledge, it should be Jacoby, right?

There you go.

I was just throwing a European twist in it.

Okay.

Jacoby, we thank you for your service.

We thank you for your loyalty.

We thank you for your cash.

OnePridePlus.com.

We do.

Yeah.

OnePridePlus.com.

And if you'd like your entire name given out across the land for everyone to look you up

where you live, if you'd like your address included, we can do that as well for an extra

fee.

OnePridePlus.com is the place to be.

Continuing with you, maybe Megan, because you were just talking then, like, what is

it about horror that appeals to you or appeals to you both?

Like what sucks you in?

And like, to me, it's something that you kind of inflict upon yourself, but you two clearly

enjoyed enough to talk about it.

So, what is it?

So I've watched horror movies for as long as I can remember with my dad.

I started young.

I think the first movie I remember watching with him was The Gate.

Either The Gate or Killer Klowns from Outer Space.

I don't know.

I don't know what interested me at that point.

I can't remember.

It was probably just hanging out with my dad.

But because I've watched so many horror movies, I have to say that must be, it must be why

they don't scare me.

I'll go to bed watching horror movies.

I'll fall asleep to Saw.

It lulls me to sleep.

So, one of the things I love about watching a horror movie is the quest to get scared.

I like going in blind and like, maybe I'll get scared this time.

I love a good jump scare.

It's like that rush that makes you feel scared, like that anxiety feeling.

I enjoy that feeling.

Like, it's just enjoyable to me when it happens.

And so I want to seek it out when I go to the movies.

And I'm often disappointed because most things don't really scare me.

You're desensitized.

I think I am.

Yeah.

I mean, I laugh at Saw.

Right, Kate?

It's like a joke.

Yeah.

Although jump scares get you still, which is pretty funny.

But it won't solidify the movie as a good horror movie for me.

I'm just like, oh, good.

I got scared.

Perfect.

Like, I want that more.

More, more, more.

I want nightmares.

Yeah.

What's your favorite jump scare movie?

Ooh.

Specifically jump scares?

Oh, that's a good question.

That's a good question.

I mean, that's usually what slashers go for.

Right, I was going to say, is it Scream?

Slashers are usually kind of that build up and jump.

Yeah, I was going to say Scream or one of those, like, yeah.

Classic jump scare movie.

I lost the thread on Scream.

I watched the first three or so, but then after that, I kind of gave up on them.

I don't know if I should be a completionist with Scream movies or not.

I mean, Kate, you and I barely became completionists, right?

When the new one came out, we were going to watch it for last year's season.

And we were like, all right, let's have a Scream-a-thon because we should.

It's a fine franchise.

It's a lot of people's like intro because it's so like pop culture, like oriented.

And there's like a huge meta element to it.

I think that the requels, the kind of like rebooted like movies that they've done in

the last couple of years aren't bad.

They're certainly better than Scream 2, but I think most things are better than Scream

2.

So you can give it a shot, but I wouldn't like really prioritize finishing the Scream

franchise over the many, many, many, many other better horror movies that have come

out in the last 20 years.

And what was your gateway into horror, Kate?

My gateway into horror, let's see, I was quite young.

I had an aunt that was living with us at the time who was not much older than me.

She was like a cool kind of big sister and she was really into horror movies.

And she had a VHS collection of horror movies.

And it was told to me that I wasn't allowed to watch any of those movies.

And I think I had an afternoon where I was home from school, I was probably like nine

or 10 and I knew I had like a two hour window before anyone else was going to be home.

And I watched Friday the 13th by myself.

And it was so scary and I loved it.

I like loved that it was different than anything I'd ever seen before.

It had all that taboo elements in it.

And it was very thrilling.

Like, oh, this is something that you're not like, I wasn't supposed to see it.

It's also so violent.

And I just got so excited like watching this movie.

And I just kind of glommed on to that feeling like Megan said.

And then when you start watching them and you like it, you get desensitized pretty quickly.

And I think for me, I'm not really thrill seeking quite as much as Megan is.

I don't watch horror movies to get scared.

I'm a huge like genre fan.

Like I love sci fi movies.

I love all kinds of movies.

I always qualify that I'm not just a horror like person.

Like I love all kinds of movies, love sci fi, love action movies, comedies, period pieces,

like all kinds of stuff.

And so I really like it when people do interesting things within the genre.

And I feel like that's really what I'm looking for is someone who's doing something new,

pushing the envelope, whether it's like writing, cinematography, storytelling.

You can tell who goes deep and which one of us stays shallow.

I don't think that's true.

No, but it's a good point because I can tell you with horror with me, any horror movies

that I've ever watched, I don't know, Andrew and Jason, if you're the same, clearly we

have two people who are like horror connoisseurs here and aren't as concerned.

Like my mind will populate empty like kind of liminal spaces with the horror that I've

seen before.

Like when I see something terrifying, it's lodged in whatever part of the brain holds

that particular memory.

And I don't know, I remember like standing in a lift one day by myself and going, yep,

that reminds me this particular movie, this thing, I better not turn my back on that corner.

This was years like I've gotten over it now, but it like stuck with me in a way.

So yeah, Andrew and Jason, do you have that?

Are you, Jason, you've been on their podcast, so maybe you like horror more.

I think that that's actual trauma you're describing there.

So you might want to-

Yeah, it sounds like trauma.

We are definitely not a mental health podcast, but let's see here.

As far as horror, I'm hit or miss.

I have been fortunate enough to talk to both of them about, I would say lighter movies

for sure.

Like I've not been on the episodes that are like hardcore murder podcasts or anything,

but are murder movies, but it's been more on the fun side generally.

So I'm more of the, I like the really like just stupid old, like really crappy movies.

I'm more of a crappy movie fan.

And if they happen to be quote unquote horror movies, I'm into that.

Like we watched Night of the Lepus, which was utter trash, but kind of great at the

same time.

I don't think I could hang with either one of them in terms of like going all the way

to like the crazy horror though.

Like I think I would be like you, I'd probably just never sleep for like a week.

Yeah.

Well, I thought we were talking about horror, not romantic comedies.

Is it a documentary?

What?

I don't know.

I want to pick up on something that Kate, you said about the first movie as a kid and

you sort of weren't meant to watch it.

Because I have a similar memory of a movie like that.

And I'm curious to know whether you think this qualifies as a horror, but I remember

my mom saying, you cannot watch this.

You are not allowed to watch this.

So of course, what did I do?

I watched it.

And it was The Fly with Jeff Goldblum.

And I don't know if that qualifies as a horror, but at the time I got to the end of it and

I was like, my mom was right.

I shouldn't have watched it.

And I really struggled to sleep that night.

And forevermore, that is kind of my, if I think about the origin of me acting in a way

that was not aligned with what I was meant to do, that was kind of the start of it.

And that movie still creeps me out.

Even to this day, I'll watch it.

And I still get creeped out almost because of the memory of who I was as a child being

creeped out by it.

And I think part of that is just Jeff Goldblum.

He's kind of a creepy looking dude.

So is that a horror?

Would you consider that to be in the genre?

Did you see my eyes light up when you said The Fly?

I love Cronenberg.

Oh my God, of course it's horror.

It's body horror.

It is disgusting and visceral and wet.

Like it's so, like everything he does is so goopy.

And I just like, I love it.

Of course it's horror.

Is that the show title?

Disgusting, Visceral and Wet?

I think that's the episode title.

Yeah, we need a name change, Kate.

I want to take that one.

So this director, I don't know much about other than my memories of the movie and stuff.

That's a director and that's his kind of vibe, is it?

Yes.

Yeah.

He is like the Da Vinci of like body horror.

Like that is a genre, a sub genre within horror films.

And he's a fairly prolific director.

And a lot of his movies have those elements of just gross things.

And he does a lot of practical effects.

And that's something that Megan and I both like really love and appreciate is it's not

a lot of or any CGI.

It's just like a lot of jello and like fake blood and like, yeah, goop.

His son also does, sorry, his son is also a director and he's very similar in style.

If you guys have seen or heard of Infinity Pool, his son directed that and it was equally

like visceral.

And I was like, I was not expecting that from this movie.

It gets gross, runs in the family.

Yeah, his daughter actually has a horror movie coming out later this year too.

So David Cronenberg is the director of The Fly, Videodrome, a bunch of stuff like that.

And then Brandon and Caitlin Cronenberg are both directors and they're on right now.

I know what you mean though, in terms of like not relying too much on CGI.

And this isn't so much a horror film.

This is more of a, I suppose, sci-fi dystopia.

But you were saying that you like sci-fi as well.

Movies like Children of Men, you've seen that?

Yeah.

It's a great movie.

You have these long drawn out, almost like theatrical or performed shots that don't rely

so much on computer effects.

Or even when you look at, I don't know, if you think about the days of like early Star

Wars and the look of models and stuff.

So you have this kind of satisfaction looking at something that looks real.

Like you find that you believe it more when it's not imagined by a computer.

Yeah, definitely.

It's more tangible.

That's one of my biggest beefs with a lot of modern action movies is that it just feels

really stale and very flat because it feels like everything's really green screened.

Even though the CGI is absolutely beautiful, it's very, very flat feeling in a lot of ways.

I tried to watch another horror movie last night.

I couldn't get through it.

I got about 25 minutes in.

I think it aged in such a poor way that I couldn't carry on.

It was called 16 Candles.

Yeah, man, that movie did age not so great.

And I say it's horror because it's so freaking inappropriate for our time.

It was horrific to watch.

Like every time long duck dong came on the screen and you get the dong.

It's so racist.

It's so bad.

It's rapey too, right?

It has that rapey.

It's really rapey.

Yeah, that's the one.

Have you not seen it all the way through?

Oh, like too long ago.

Too long ago to remember.

I've only got vague memories of it at this point.

And we thought it'd be a fun watch, you know, like, oh, let's relive our youth, you know,

and watch this movie.

No, I couldn't do it.

It is if you've seen it in its time and you can be like, okay, I get it.

Like it wasn't like this when it came out, you know, and now it is.

And you can forgive its sins a bit more.

But yeah, if you're watching it for the first time now, it's not or, you know, essentially

the first time now it's not fun to watch.

You feel cringy and you're not supposed to.

A warning for those who might be wanting to relive their youth, you know.

Breakfast Club still holds up.

I'll stand by that one.

Yeah, that's a good one.

16 Candles, not so much.

Not so much the 16 Candles.

Nah.

That was brutal.

Because people get mad when you don't talk about podcasting on a podcast.

I do want to ask a follow up question quickly.

You said you started this back pandemic time.

You could have easily just watched a movie on FaceTime together or whatever and just

chatted about it.

Why go through all the extra, call it hassle of getting microphones and recording stuff

and editing and having to put it somewhere for other people to download?

Like what?

This is easy.

What was the drive to do that?

Did you both say like, podcast at the same time?

Or did somebody try to prod the other one until you finally agreed to do it?

Like, how did that work?

So we had talked about doing it for a while, but there was no like motivation.

It was just like, Oh, that'll be fun.

You know, that's fine.

I think once the pandemic hit, it was like, Okay, everyone's making a podcast.

Now's our time.

We're home all the time.

Let's do it.

Like everybody else said.

And it was important to record because as Kate said earlier, we're always right.

And it's important that other people know.

But most importantly, we are going to buy our cemetery plots next to each other and

dig a trench between our two coffins and put a little radio and string our headphones to

each other's coffins and listen to each other talk for all of eternity on repeat.

So it's important that we have this backlog.

It's beautiful.

Really?

Yeah.

It's a good memorialization of friendship.

Yeah.

To sum it up.

Yeah.

I mean, also, like the horror community is like a really, really fervent community.

Like, it's something that I knew kind of logically, but once we started putting out content, you

would really see we get listeners in bursts.

And you can tell that there are listeners that will tune in for a season because they're

diehard Chucky, like Child's Play fans.

And they're going to come around in droves, and they're going to listen to that whole

season and then they're going to drop off and listen to literally nothing else.

And so there's a lot of really intense fandoms that once we started recording and putting

it out there and on social media, we'd get these pickups of people who are really into

the particular sub genres or franchises that we were doing.

That for me was a cool motivator to keep going to.

And Megan and I get really excited talking about specific actors or directors or themes

that we can focus seasons on.

So there's like internal motivation to keep going to.

Yeah, I also have a YouTube channel where we paint miniatures totally unrelated to horror.

It has nothing to do with horror, or movies.

And there's a handful of people there who I know get excited for a new episode.

And so there's like this little tiny cluster of people that will just, you know, hit me

up and chat a little bit about a movie or an opinion I had or you know, something they

want to argue about.

And I enjoy that.

I would love to see the community, you know, I would love to see our community grow a little

bit more.

I think it's a bandwidth thing, right, Kate?

We'll get there.

Yeah, definitely.

This is definitely a passion project for sure.

And I think that it's something that we like doing and we keep doing it.

YouTube.com/thehobbycollab.

And when you say miniatures, sorry, I just want to clarify, miniatures, what are we talking

about?

Are we talking about Dungeons and Dragons miniatures or minifigs, Lego minifigs?

Like, what are we talking here?

We're talking Games Workshop.

We're talking Warhammer 40k and Age of Sigmar, primarily.

But yeah, we'll paint whatever.

We've shifted around to different board games, depending on our mood, or what it is we're

trying to, like a technique we're trying to highlight, etc.

But primarily it is a Games Workshop centered hobby stream.

Yeah.

And Kate was just on that with Megan doing a thing, what was that?

We did horror.

A couple weeks ago?

Yeah, we did horror figures.

This had nothing to do with Games Workshop.

It was about a month and a half ago, I want to say.

God, was it that long ago?

By the time this comes out, it's going to be like two months ago, because it was beginning

of June.

Yeah.

Just time keeps on trucking.

So the two of you are proximate to one another, not like the three of us who are separated

by thousands of kilometers or miles.

Yeah, we're a quick two hour flight away from each other.

Yeah.

Did you all invite anyone else?

Because I've got another person trying to pop into the call here.

Did either of you?

No?

I think I'll just let them in and see what happens.

Unannounced Trivia Corner Special Edition!

OK.

Pew, pew!

Andrew Space.

God, you're excited.

Look at the excitement, the enthusiasm.

I wish I'd got a screenshot.

Love it.

Jason, you know, there are people in my real life, like tangible 3D people who have gone,

one of the answers coming.

Nobody knows.

That's the great part of Unannounced Trivia Corner is that I get to have a blast and neither

of you do.

But there's a twist, because I am not the host of Unannounced Trivia Corner today.

Who is, you ask?

Great question.

To my left, Kate is going to be the host of Unannounced Trivia Corner today.

For both Andrew and Martin.

And Jason.

So, Kate, please.

Are you answering, Jason?

I am.

I am an impartial judge.

Oh, goodness.

I was going to say that you guys don't know the questions or the answers I'm proposing,

so this could be open, but I'll lead us into this.

So the theme of the Trivia Corner is the TV streaming series Black Mirror.

There's a little bit of overlap in the Venn diagram between our podcasts of technology

and horror.

So I thought it was topical.

And if you guys have seen it, great.

If you haven't, even better for this bit.

Megan and I love a bit.

I have not watched it.

I know what it is, but I haven't watched it.

Great.

You're going to do fantastically.

Excellent.

All right.

The first question is, what is my favorite Black Mirror episode?

The one with the pig.

The one everybody knows.

Do you have ABC options?

Of course, Andrew.

It's unannounced Trivia Corner.

There's a format.

I do have ABC options.

I would love to, although I kind of wish I was just making it.

Thank goodness.

There is a form.

I was told that there is a very specific format.

Okay.

A, Sandunapero.

B, Hang the DJ.

Or C, The Entire History of You.

Oh, God.

This presumes that I know what the episodes are based on their title.

Yep.

It does.

Your name starts with the letter C, so I'm going to say C.

Oh, good strategy.

That was the answer I was going to say as well, based on less than that.

But C, yeah.

Megan?

A, Sandunapero.

Great.

Next question is ... The next question is, what is the episode Nosedive about?

A, an AI company has to cut its bots free after its stock value drops.

B, a world where your value is literally rated via social media.

Or C, someone invents cocaine that has nanobots in it.

Now I'm interested.

Andrew, you answer first.

Okay.

I think I'm going to go B. I remember that social media episode.

So, yes.

I think that's what it is, because I think his social media credits plunge.

I think it's a B.

Megan?

Oh, I'm next?

Okay.

Yeah, I think it's B. I think I remember it being B.

Well, just to be different, I'll say A, even though I'm probably wrong.

Great.

And that was Unannounced Trivia Corner.

Thanks, guys.

Yay.

Thanks for watching.

Fantastic.

See you next time.

Okay.

That's ...

Oh, it's just the best.

Everybody loves Unannounced Trivia Corner.

There's not a single person on the planet that is just not stoked.

There's like so many people listening to this episode now, and they're just annoyed.

Like, it's like watching a magic trick and not knowing how it was done.

But there's no joy in the performance.

It's just annoyance.

There was plenty of joy.

It was just all mine.

So, you're welcome.

I got to do some creative writing in that second question.

So, I at least got some joy from it.

So, you'll have one listener who liked it.

All right.

Well, thank you for playing Unannounced Trivia Corner.

As if you had a choice.

I've got an unannounced topic now.

Well, semi-announced.

Jason and Martin might know a little bit about this, but Megan and Kate, you might struggle.

But I'm going to put you on the spot.

It's counter chat time.

Oh my gosh.

Again?

Is this every week now?

If you talk to people, it is.

So, Megan and Kate, I don't know if you've listened to recent episodes, but we have had

a bit of a thing.

Martin is generally the person that is happy to talk to anybody at any time in any situation.

And he will talk to people.

Yeah, like compulsively, like obsessively.

Yeah, he's a talker.

So, he'll go into a shop or a store and he will talk to the cashier, the clerk.

What do you call those people?

He will talk to anybody.

All day.

Oh my God.

So, I'm going to put it to the two of you first.

In recent history, can you recall a time where you struck up a conversation with a person

in a retail environment?

Yeah, I did like last week.

I'm kind of one of those people too.

I was friendly.

Is there anything you'd like to share?

Is there an anecdote?

Oh, what was it?

The guy in front of me in line at a grocery store was talking to the bagging clerk about

David Lynch and it's like physically impossible for me to not insert myself into a conversation,

especially about David Lynch.

And so, I ended up talking to the guy for like 10.

I was there for too long.

It was way too long.

I love it.

Megan is like accessing her mental archives as we speak.

You all right?

I know I did this.

It was just so unimportant that I immediately erased it from my brain.

It's like the kind of thing where you're, I know, terrible, right?

Not that anybody out there is unimportant.

I just, nothing sticks in here, you know?

I have to watch a movie like five times before I can talk about it with Kate.

So I'll just say that I probably made a corny joke and this person probably laughed, to

be polite.

That's probably what happened because that's usually what happens and that's the extent

of my conversation with strangers.

But you took the initiative and you did it.

Yeah.

I'm not afraid to do that.

I think that's excellent.

That's a great entry point to a longer conversation.

So now you can continue to set stretch goals for yourself.

Okay.

I'm going to start with the corny joke and I'm going to build on it from there next time.

And then the time after that, you're basically-

Stretch goals.

We'll establish some KPIs.

Why?

Leave it to Andrew to put OKRs on f*** talking to people in a store.

Oh my God.

If they don't laugh at my joke, can I file a bug?

I'm just corny.

Well, I can share.

I had a customer counter chat just last night.

I was at the pub and every Friday night they have- Friday, Saturday nights, I forget my

days mixed up, it was Saturday night.

They have a raffle.

So if you- as a way to encourage you to stay there and buy more drinks, every time you

buy drinks, you get a little raffle ticket.

Is this familiar?

Do you guys know what raffle tickets are?

Is this universal?

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

Megan, this is a great opportunity for us to be like, what are you talking about?

Damn it, Meg.

Raffle tickets.

I'm so bad.

I'm sorry.

I don't know what a raffle ticket is.

Anyway, please, sorry.

Continue.

Yes, it is a global phenomenon.

It's fine.

And so me being me, I've lined up my tickets.

You know, I'm ready.

The draw- it's draw time.

And it was like, orange.

Yes, that's me.

D. Yes, that's me.

And then it said 30.

And I'm like, yes, it's-

And then they just stopped.

It was like, oh, D30, not D32, which I was expecting it to be.

So I lost by a couple of things.

But the winning prize is a meat tray, which is a classic Australian prize for a raffle

at a pub.

A meat-

Natasha won a few through raffles recently.

It's huge.

If you win the meat tray, it's big time.

Is it a tray that is used for serving meat on, or is it a tray with meat on it?

It's a tray with meat.

And it's supplied by the local butcher shop.

Is it like raw?

Yeah.

Can you eat it raw?

Okay.

That's Megan's alley.

I mean, so the table across from me won the meat tray, which was fair enough, you know,

can't win them all.

But I was curious to know about this meat tray.

So I just thought, I'm going to go find out.

So I wandered over to the winner and said, hi, congratulations on your prize.

I was just wondering, would you mind if I just had a little look at the meat tray?

I'm curious to know what you get.

He starts eating it.

You have, honestly, can I just say, on the topic of stretch goals, Andrew, you have come

leaps and bounds.

When I first brought this up years ago on the show, I was like, oh, how could you do

that, Martin?

And now you're just, you're just going up to tables and asking people to look at their

meat.

Let me see your meat.

Show me your meat.

It probably helped that I had a few beers, you know, in an attempt to try and win the

meat tray.

But nevertheless, I did it.

And I just want to tell you, this meat tray, I'm going back.

It's worth winning.

It had some lamb chops, had some sausages, had a chicken Kiev.

Like it was stacked.

Do you need any of that raw?

Yeah.

I mean, I prefer to take it home and barbecue it, but you know, you do you.

So anyway, I had a nice little interaction with the other person and I said, thanks for

sharing your meat tray experience with me.

I hope you enjoy it.

Have a good night.

And I went back to my table.

There you go.

Customer counter chat.

Did you say thank you for sharing your meat experience with me?

Did you really say that?

I might have said something along those lines.

I am known to make weird, weird phrasing.

That table is now sharing their version of their story with a very different tone with

all of their friends.

Yeah.

I promise it wasn't creepy.

I was at a...

Well.

Hey, guys.

I'm excited for I started with this, this new chapter we've got going, this new segment,

the artwork changes hopefully each time.

So when I was doing a counter chat, I had an old photo of myself at a counter, then

it was Andrew.

Andrew, your challenge is to find an appropriate photo for this chapter artwork that somehow

has to do with your meat experience.

I don't know how that's going to work out.

Oh, we're so delisted.

We're getting delisted.

That's it.

We're done.

One seventeen.

This is it.

It's over.

Oh, my God.

So that French guy who knocked over the high jump bar.

I think we just put that in there and just let people make of it what they will.

Yeah.

Just put Andrew's face on it.

That's it.

Oh, yes.

On the jump.

Oh, geez.

Yeah.

Or close.

He's jumping and it's Andrew's face.

Or just floating nearby asking about it.

Yeah.

Hey, what's that?

Yeah.

Nice meat tray.

It was a good one.

There we go.

Well done.

So many titles.

Actually, while we're in this kind of realm, because we were talking about community before

with the horror podcast and also your miniatures on YouTube.

Like counter chat kind of reminds me, when you talk about podcasting, generally the stereotype

that jumps into your head is a lot of white men talking crap and that's it.

Right.

You two are not white men talking crap.

Right.

We kind of enter that realm.

I mean, we're white girls talking crap.

Sure.

I mean, you kind of put it that way.

But when it comes to the horror community or even things around miniatures, the things

that you are both interested in, what's that been like?

Have you come up against any kind of interesting stereotypes or trends in that community?

Things to do with maybe men in that realm or podcasting?

What's your experience been?

I have a story for each, Kate, both the miniatures and the horror stuff.

Throw my husband under the bus for this one.

But this is my white crap talking husband.

So Kate and I, I think a year ago, we're trying to think like, how can we rethink or reformat

or re-market our podcast?

We would love to have it pick up.

We just don't have the bandwidth.

Is there something we can do?

And we were brainstorming.

My husband, Zach, he wrote the music that we use for our podcast.

So he's involved a little bit.

And we value his opinions with a grain of salt.

And his idea was that we should market ourselves as horror archetypes, two different female

archetypes within the horror genre.

And I'm thinking like, oh, this could be interesting, like a little thought provoking.

I had blonde hair at the time.

So the role he chose for me is the girl who gets it first, the dumb one.

I get to ask a bunch of dumb questions and just be kind of a general bozo.

While Kate, Kate with her brown hair is the final girl.

She's the smart one.

She makes it to the end.

She's where all the insight comes from.

And this is now our marketing idea.

And I looked at Kate later on and I was like, Kate, if he wasn't my husband, I would have

slapped him.

I don't like any of these ideas.

We sat through this presentation where he was like, yeah, you can be like the dumb,

sexy one and you can be the brown haired one that lives.

We were like, oh, cool.

Presentation with the slides.

Wait, wait.

Yeah.

Hold that back up.

Oh yeah, there was slides.

Yeah, there was a presentation, Jake.

We haven't even had slides yet.

Have we?

I don't even think we've done.

We've not even gone that far.

Oh my God.

Slides.

Yeah, it was serious.

We need to get him on the show.

So I didn't like that.

Oh, you should.

He'd be great.

He's a good talker too.

Wow.

So I didn't, I didn't enjoy that.

Only if he brings a slide deck.

Yeah.

Right.

Okay.

So what you said you had one for the YouTube as well.

Well, so I guess I should back that up a little bit.

I don't have a specific story.

Nothing has actually happened to me.

My community that I'm in, the community we've built for our channel is very welcoming, warm,

not sexist, Zach.

But the world of Warhammer and miniature painting and miniature tabletop board gaming is rife

with that kind of thing.

And so I'm always aware of that in the back of my head.

I need to watch what I do and say and how I act and I need to be good at these things.

Like it's really important to me.

And this probably isn't true.

I don't probably need to feel this way, but I can't help it.

Right.

I'm representing women to some extent within this genre.

And there aren't that many of them.

And I don't want to give the grognards of the world a reason to hate us more.

So it's important to me that I'm decent at playing the game and that I'm a decent painter.

And so that's pretty much that.

It doesn't weigh heavily on my mind, but it is something that I'm aware of.

It's very unfair, isn't it?

Yeah.

I mean, in a way, I mean, yes, life isn't fair, right?

But I'm very, in a way, fortunate, but also we put in the hard work to make sure that

we are not surrounded by that.

And our community is just not like that.

Yeah.

You don't have to give specific examples, obviously, but have there been instances where

you've had to like banhammer people and just like moderate the community?

Or has it been somewhat self-moderating?

Not in our channel's community.

My husband, sorry, Zach used to work for another channel and that channel got really big, like

over 100K subscribers.

And there was a bit of that happening there.

We're also slightly like, I want to say salacious.

We get a little PG-13, mild R rated, right?

We make tons of innuendos.

We make all kinds of like, not inappropriate, but like sarcastic jokes, things like that.

So we invited a little bit.

So we invite a little bit of it, but it stays friendly.

Like everybody's intentions are pretty obvious.

We're all just goofing off together.

I think that's just the nature of all these communities though.

Part of why I like that we're not super mega huge is because there's always that tipping

point of no matter what, you're going to hit a point where you're big enough to where the

shit goblins will come in no matter what.

But if you can keep it right on that razor's edge of enough people to have community, but

then also, I guess it's gatekeeping, but it's gate keeping shitty people.

So I think that's okay.

There's just that constant battle though, of trying to go back and forth.

And like something like YouTube, that seems very hard because YouTube is just, any video

has a comment on it of like just horrific shit, no matter what.

It's like, here's a puppy and they're like, you should die.

And it's like, what do you, what, why?

What is happening?

We have gotten comments like that.

Not you should die exactly, but we've put out a few shorts where we show how we updated

a model or, I don't know, took it apart, reassembled it with different parts.

And here's our new creation, things like that.

And we'll get people who are like, you shouldn't play this army.

You shouldn't play this game.

What the hell is wrong with you?

They just go on and on.

I'm like, this is crazy.

So we kind of turned it around on its head.

We took a bunch of those really wild comments, and then we brought them onto our show as

a segment and we ranked them.

Like, okay, which comments are the best?

Which ones are lame?

Like, who had the lamest insults versus the best ones?

I think that was pretty fun for us.

Actually, it was nice to turn it on its head.

Rapid Fire Plug Corner.

We've got Not Quite Dead podcast.

We've got the Hobby Collab on YouTube.

What else do we have to share?

No, I think that covers all the promo in my life.

Isn't that enough?

Are you not entertained?

Maybe let's reframe it then.

If you don't have anything to plug, taking inspiration from Andrew's favorite business

corner, what's your call to action for the listeners?

What should they do from here?

Be kind to yourselves, be kind to each other, and always be creating.

I just want to say thank you.

First of all, Jason, for setting up this great conversation.

Kate and Megan, it's been great to have you on.

I've certainly learned a lot as a non-horror person.

And I suppose I'd throw in as my call to action, people listening to this, go check out what

they're making online and come to our Discord where you can maybe chat to them.

If you're nice though, we want nice people, not those others we mentioned.

Yeah, thanks so much for having us, guys.

This is really fun.

Loved it.

Thank you so much.

All right.

In three, two, one.

Stop.
