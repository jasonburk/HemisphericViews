We have verified it is episode 97, 097 in our preferred nomenclature.
Not your everyday Hemispheric Views episode because today is a special game show.
Hit the music.
Do do do do do do do do do do do do.
Okay today it is.
I'm definitely using that in future.
Hemispheric Views Duel of the Defaults.
It's the showdown of the 45 minutes.
That's right.
We have one and only defending champion Mr. Default himself, Martin the Foot Felt.
Hello there.
Great to have you on the show today.
Yeah, I wasn't expecting to be on today.
It's nice to be here as a guest and the defending champion of a competition that we've never
run.
Yes, well you have often named yourself as Mr. Default and we may have named you that
as well.
Now that the question we have, we always ask, I guess, a couple of questions before we get
into the game itself.
Do you prefer the nickname Mr. Default or the Foot?
I think they kind of go hand in hand because by enforcing and accepting that standard of
enforcing it on other people in a very footful way, you know, you can't have one without
the other.
I think they're both great.
You really should have said they go foot in foot.
Oh, foot in foot.
But that's okay.
There's plenty of time in the show.
Well, good luck today.
Now let's go over to our challenger, Jason Burke.
Somewhat surprise entrant to our competition duel of the Defaults, often known for trying
all sorts of apps.
But I think Jason, you might be turning over a new leaf.
Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Yeah, well, over the course of 97 episodes, including a triple zero that was thrown in
there in the beginning, pretty much since day one, he has held this over our heads as
a superiority stature that he really has.
He's Mr. Default.
No one else can be Mr. Default ever.
No one can beat him.
And after 97 some odd episodes, three years, enough is enough.
So I've been training really hard in the area and art of Default.
And I think I can take him today in this 47 round bout of Default applications.
And that includes step 45A and two, right?
That is correct.
Yes.
Gotcha.
And he's just the host of the show, and I can tell you that he's also annoyed me with
his love of the Default.
So all the best for the challenger.
I think it's going to be a great contest, whichever way it pans out.
So for those listening in at home, let me just run you through some of the rules.
There's not a lot of rules.
Basically we've got a whole bunch of app categories and we're going to go through and we're going
to find out which applications these two contestants are using to do said category of work.
I will be grading them on the level of defaultness.
No correspondence will be entered into.
It is my determination as to whether it's default and I'll be assigning points based
on the level of defaultness.
So that's how it's going to work.
We'll sum those, tally those up at the end and we will have ourselves a champion Defaulter.
They will, if you wish, they will win by default.
Brilliant.
This is making a lot of sense.
I love it.
This is so good.
Contestants, can we just check your buzzers?
No need for buzzers because it's a question that you both get to answer.
I just always wanted to say that.
It's been a long, long dream of mine to host a game show and this is the best, closest
I'm ever going to get to it.
So let's start off with a fundamental category.
And I should say, before I get into it, we are limited time because Martin has a hard
out.
So let's not dilly dally.
We're going to talk very briefly about your apps, but we're not going to ramble.
All right, let's get into the show.
Okay.
Round one.
Mail server.
Mail server.
Martin, how long do you think it's going to take before he forgets what number he's on
since he decided to start with one?
Yeah, I shouldn't have started with numbers.
The beginning round.
Each round is going to be slowly slower because he's going to have to count them.
As the defending champion, Martin, you get the right of first response.
What is your mail server of choice?
I was going to say when I saw this first on the list, I was like, I didn't even think
about this.
Oh, wait, it's iCloud.
iCloud.
Okay.
All right.
That's quite default if you're in the Apple universe.
And just to explain, it is Apple stuff, right?
This is when we say default, that's an important definition.
Yeah, that is.
We are an Apple tech adjacent podcast.
So I should say the scoring, the way I'm going to decide to do it is low score is a good
score.
So Martin, you get a one.
Great.
Jason, your mail server.
It is iCloud slash fast mail.
Okay.
But what's your main one?
Is that the question?
Like the one?
No, you can have two.
It's not mine.
It's his choice.
He's chosen to answer it with two.
That to me is a, it's a prevarication.
He has defaulted, but he's not embraced the default.
So for that, Jason, I'm giving you a three.
And lower is better?
Is that correct?
Lower is better.
Yes, we want default.
But how does that work?
Like if I have more default options, doesn't that make me Mr. Default at the end if I have
more or if Jason has more?
Don't confuse the mathematics, please.
All I'm thinking is that we're in a binary situation, but I don't want to give you zero.
So I'm going to give you one.
I know three is not binary because I didn't want to give him two because then it looks
like I'm just adding up the mail servers.
And that's not how I really want it to go either.
Like I said, the scoring is mine to determine.
Okay.
So just shut up.
Okay.
Jason just added in another category.
I thought we had this in there.
It's weird.
Maybe it'll come up again later in the table.
It's in the list above, but it wasn't in the table.
Ah, okay.
Common problem.
So we've said the mail server.
Now for the mail client.
Jason, mail client.
Oh, I get to go first this time.
I'll mix it up.
That would be Outlook.
No, not really.
That would be Apple Mail.
Okay.
Apple Mail.
That is a good solid default right there.
We're not going into platforms, by the way.
I'm taking the view that we're broadly speaking Mac OS, but I'm not going to get into platform
specifics.
It's too complicated.
You're the one making up the rules as we go.
So that's a one.
Okay.
Martin, mail client.
Same.
Is that, I've not heard of same.
Is that good?
Yeah.
It's just not the name for Apple Mail.
Okay.
Or mail.app.
That's the nerds like to call it.
That's a one for you too, Martin.
All right.
Let's keep this thing cracking.
We've got a type 45.
Notes.
We all love notes.
I love notes.
I wish I was in this category.
I wish I was answering questions because you know, I'd have like 17 answers, but we want
to hear from Martin.
I actually had a bit of trouble with this because for the longest time in the podcast,
I've said I'm not like a notes user, but all of my notes historically and notes that I
share with Natasha are in notes, but my extended writing or note taking, particularly for research
and stuff is IA writer.
So I'd say it's a dual answer of IA writer and notes.
It's interesting that you would classify IA writer as a notes app, not a writing app.
Yeah, but I do keep some notes in there for meetings.
So I want to be transparent here.
Giving you a two.
Jason, what's your notes app?
Apple notes, mic drop.
What happened to Obsidian?
You were, you were in love with Obsidian.
Apple notes.
Apple notes.
That's scores of one.
It's very annoying.
You can't use, if Apple notes would add markdown, then it would be perfect, but they haven't
done it and change the font, that font, this font.
I'm using this, I'm typing the scores in Apple notes and this font is disgusting.
Okay.
Moving right along because we have so many categories.
I don't want to, I don't want to undersell any of these apps, but we have a lot.
So any other comments on notes?
Because I know notes app is a really critical area.
Do we have any other comments final from our contestants?
Well we're using it for the HV topic pool now, so it must be good.
Okay.
To do.
What do we track our to dos in?
And I'm going to hear, I'm going to ask Martin once again to lead us off with the to do apps.
Uh, look, I actually don't like keeping to dos or lists.
I prefer to just keep it in my head, whether it's personal tasks or work.
But if I have to use one and I'm going to forget something, I use reminders.
Reminders.
That's a solid score of one.
Have you, and you have, but you haven't engineered it with a system.
You're not, you're not using it.
You can ban boards features.
Are you basically just talking into it?
Just yelling commands.
If it's something that has to be days in the future, I go, Oi, you know, dingus, Hey dingus,
as they say, remind me of this.
But normally I just like to remember stuff.
Okay.
You know, you don't even have to say, Hey dingus anymore.
You can just say dingus.
Yeah, but it's polite to greet the thing.
I agree.
I often say thank you afterwards as well.
Good.
Jason Burke.
What do you use for to do apps?
I mean, I know, I know you have a long association with things.
That's true.
Yeah.
I use the one true system.
Emacs.
That is false.
I use reminders.
What happened?
What happened to things?
Things is gone.
It's reminders.
Now you've really been in, you've really been in training, haven't you?
You weren't mucking around.
Yeah.
Like there's Rocky and then there's me.
Okay.
That's good.
And now just a quick reminder to our audience at home.
If you enjoy this show and you'd like to hear more content such as like this from our Hemispheric
Views universe, remember oneprimeplus.com.
What is it Jason?
Oneprimeplus.com.
It's in the long game.
Thank you.
And shout out, shout out to LisaD, new One Prime Plus subscriber.
LisaD, thank you so much.
As I like to say, there's SandraD.
She's okay.
But then the real value is in LisaD.
Yes now, next app category.
I know you're all waiting in bated breath.
Who's going to have the first time to answer it?
Who am I going to pick?
What's the category?
iPhone 45 photo shooting.
Why does it say 45 inside our category there?
I don't know.
I think that's a typo.
That wasn't a funny, clever joke, was it?
Yeah.
We're getting the edit, real time editing.
Okay.
So I'm going to read that category again.
iPhone photo shooting.
And I want to ask Jason.
I assume you refer, you are speaking of the application in which I would be taking photos
with, which I like to call Swipe Left.
Swipe Left photos.
That is it.
I'd never, I've never internalized that Swipe Left very well.
How do you open the camera?
I think I use the little button.
That's what annoys me the most about those buttons is having two exact, two ways to get
to the same thing.
And that button is just wasted.
Oh, Swipe's better.
I just forget.
Yeah.
It's, it's always a swipe.
I get confused when I'm in the home screen and I try to swipe to get to the camera and
it's like not there.
So yeah, Swipe Left.
Or is that Swipe Right?
Swipe Swipe Left.
Swiping it from right to me is a left swipe.
Does that mean I do want to hook up or I don't want to hook up?
I'm not sure.
I think that means it's good.
We're going to say it's good.
We've got dating.
We've got default dating apps down the queue.
So just hold your horses.
LinkedIn.
Camera.
Windows Control Alt Shift L.
Martin Feld, Mr. Default, Defending Champion, iPhone photo shooting.
What do you use?
We know you use Glass, but what do you take the photos with?
I do like trying third party apps and I do have some, but the actual one that I use,
same Swipe Left Photos, default camera.
If you could make that Swipe Left open a third party camera, I'd be way more open to
using other ones.
It's just, I need the photo and I need it now.
It is handy.
I have tried doing like Obscura as a little widget in that top row of little icons, but
it's not the same as swiping.
I agree.
Well, Martin, you score two for that one.
You only get two because you've been cheating on photos.
How have I been cheating?
It's the one that I use.
Yeah, but you said you sometimes use others.
So I'm getting penalized for my honesty.
Jason, have you ever downloaded and tried a third party camera app?
Not even once.
That is the biggest lie I have ever heard.
Are you questioning the judge?
Yeah.
Next category.
Bloody hell.
All right, Martin, you seem to have a little something to say, a little fired up, so let's
carry on with you.
What do you use for photo management?
You a Lightroom guy?
Photos.app.
See, I will give you one point for that.
I'm not cruel.
I'm just trustworthy and honest.
Jason, photos?
Photos.application.
That's a longer answer, so he gets four points.
Is that how it works, Andrew?
What's your name again?
No, that's not how it works.
This typing is dodgy in this Notes app.
It keeps moving my cursor around and like backspacing my cursor.
I think it's you.
Bug.
Okay.
One of my favorite categories.
I wish I was competing.
Calendar.
Jason Burke, what do you use for calendar?
I know you're expecting me to say calendar.app, but I can't use that because it is actually
incorrect in the data that it shows because it cannot count week numbers.
So it is Fantastical, the only calendar that actually works.
And it costs $7,000 per annum.
So that-
At least it has the week numbers, correct.
Look, we don't have this level of detail, but I'm going to incorporate this into the
score.
What calendar backend is that hooking into?
Same as mail.
It would be iCloud and FastMail.
Okay, that's a three.
Did you say you're not incorporating it?
Was it my mail, a two?
I don't know what that means.
What's your answer, Martin?
Calendar.
Yes.
And I can verify, despite what Jason says, that the week numbers are correct because
it is the fourth week of the year.
Okay.
Thank you.
We tested that feature.
And what backend are you using for your calendars, Martin?
iCloud.
That's my main or personal account.
I almost feel like I should give you a negative one for that score.
It's so good.
But I'm just going to give you a one.
Thanks.
Are people having fun at home yet?
Are you enjoying?
Are you playing along?
They'd better be, said the foot.
Exactly.
Don't worry, we'll upload all these scores so you can have a closer look later.
And we're moving into our next category.
What number are we up to?
Oh, like nine.
I don't know.
Who cares?
We already lost count.
Didn't get numbers next to them.
Cloud file storage.
Oh yeah.
Jason?
iCloud.
Drive.app.
Okay.
Are you cheating on it with other platforms?
No, I am not.
I do keep getting emails from Dropbox for some reason, even though I haven't had an account
in 10 years.
But I don't think that counts.
No, no, you can't.
That's not your fault.
So I'll give you a one for that.
Well done.
Congratulations.
Martin?
iCloud.
Drive.app.
Okay.
I'm going to give you a negative one for that.
I'm going to give you a negative one for that.
And then you can cut out the part where halfway through I asked if there's going to be the
music that's been playing the whole time.
So Jason, in Hard Quiz, the show on the ABC, that you have to nominate your own special
category.
So you come into the show with a category that you think you are expert at and the others
will not be.
What would you nominate as your special category?
Is it from the selection we have here?
Or do I have to add a new one?
No, just anything, anything in the world you think you know more about than anybody else.
Like a fandom or expert topic could be really, really, really particular.
Dragnet.
That was very particular.
A TV show.
Super specific.
All right.
Dragnet.
That is one point.
I'm not actually scoring this, but that's very good.
Martin, what would you be your special topic on Hard Quiz?
Well, I was pissed off because someone already did it and it was The Matrix.
And she won that particular episode and she was great, but she actually got in a bit of
a tiff with Tom, the host, because she disputed one of the answers and he was like, no, it's
what the card says and it's actually correct.
So your answer's wrong.
And I was like, quivering at home at that point.
Was she correct or was the card?
The card was correct.
She misquoted something.
And look, she was fantastic.
Not having a go, but it was like, oh, no, no, no.
I could have won that.
Martin, what did the straighter?
You heard it here first.
Next category, RSS.
Really simple syndication.
Jason Burke, what do you use to read your feeds?
This would be a feeder.
F E E D E R.
You are writing in my cell, Andrew.
I am too.
Are you sure it's feeder, not reader?
Reader R E E D E R.
See this is challenging because the only default, there isn't really a default option.
There used to be RSS feeds in Safari.
There are no more.
Oh, I beg to differ.
Hmm.
Okay.
Well, I was going to give Jason a two, but I'll keep that.
I'm going to write it down, but it may change based on Martin's answer.
All right, Martin Feld, what have you got?
RSS.
I'm using NetNewswire backed by the sync service that is iCloud.
So am I though.
I'm backed by iCloud as well.
There you go.
Good on you.
Okay.
Well, NetNewswire is a long, I love reader.
I love me some reader.
Don't get me wrong.
But NetNewswire is an outstanding Mac citizen from many years ago.
It has its heritage way back.
I remember using it years ago.
This is not a contest of which app has the most gray hair.
One point for NetNewswire.
Congratulations, Martin.
That is a better Mac default.
Wow.
Although it's more, to be fair to Jason here, we're both using the default option for syncing
things, right?
It doesn't matter.
The next one is going to be challenging for us all, all three.
I clued myself in this because all three of us basically are nerds, which also means we
probably have very limited friendship circles, which probably means we don't have much of
a call for contacts management.
Martin Feld, what do you use for contacts management?
Contacts.
Okay.
Contacts by?
iCloud.
Okay, good.
That's one point.
Very good.
Jason Burke.
Same.
I should start copying and pasting this.
Did you see that typing?
See, I typed and it went weird.
See, if Andrew were doing this, he would manage his contacts with Devon Jimbo and link that
to an Excel spreadsheet somewhere with a full table of all the people he's ever known.
Am I right?
Yes.
It's, yes.
It's building your own personal CRM.
That's what it's all about.
Mail Merge.
It's like a pivot table.
I just know you're sending Christmas cards to all your family and friends through like
Outlook Mail Merge with Word or something.
That was a good feature.
Possibly the most default critical choice you could make in a computing world of these
days and that is the web browser.
How do you surf the worldwide web, Martin Feld?
Safari.
And that goes for like all Apple platforms, just to be clear.
This is extraordinarily default.
I should just say Mr. Default Defending Champion is doing really well overall.
Just want to give you that credit.
Thank you.
Still time though for the challenger.
And that time starts now with your browser of choice.
When I like to cruise the information super highway, I jump in my car and go on Safari.
That was an unexpected narrative arc.
Zing.
Thank you.
What happened to arc?
Safari did all the same stuff in Safari 17.
Was it the profiles?
And it does two-factor codes.
That really annoyed you previously?
Profiles and the ability to send domains to specific profiles, regardless of where you
click on them, were the two big things that I really, really liked.
And just having it on all the devices just works really well.
Although I still, it could be a fever dream.
It's possible.
But at one point during the beta of Safari 17, I swear they gave you per profile icons
in the dock with your little picture logo, like kind of where the notifications would
be.
I swear that happened and it was the greatest thing ever.
And I've never seen it since.
So if anybody remembers that happening, please let me know.
Because I do feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
You weren't using edge, were you?
Which has that feature?
No, absolutely not.
Okay.
Just checking.
No.
I like Safari.
Just out of curiosity, if I had said edge, like, would that be like 11 points?
Like how many points?
In the game, there'd be no coming back.
Okay.
Yeah.
I wish Safari, I like Safari.
I still think the profile switching between profiles in Arc is better, but I know I'm
not a contestant, but I too have gone back from Arc as my default to Safari.
And now Arc is my secondary browser.
So yeah.
This next category is a little weird because what is it really anymore?
I don't know, but we're going to go with chat.
What do you classify as chat?
Back in the day, it would have been iChat AV with AIM, which I could never use.
All right.
Put that down.
That is not my option.
Jason, what's your option for chat?
AOL Instant Messenger, baby.
Beautiful.
That's one point.
I don't know.
I'm not really sure what chat means.
I think what you want me to say is iMessage, but I don't really think that, I mean, it's
chat in a way.
I feel like the closest thing I do to chat would be Discord.
Do we mean messaging?
Is that what you mean as the main kind of thing that you do in life?
I took messaging as a different thing than chat.
Okay.
Messaging, I would say iMessage, but chat, I don't know, for some reason, and maybe it's
because I'm of the era of, you know, ICQ and all that crap.
Yeah.
Discord says chat to me.
So I don't know.
It's a challenging category.
Well, should we actually break those apart?
Because I would answer the same way as Jason.
To me, I don't want to talk anywhere other than iMessage, but that's messaging then.
And chat.
All right.
So both of you are saying iMessage.
So they cancel each other out.
So we don't need to add another category in.
We're just going to call it, yeah, we'll leave it as chat, but we're going to say brackets,
not messaging.
So kind of accepting that iMessage is the default experience.
And everybody uses it.
And like it's redundant.
Okay.
So then you basically saying.
We're going to get so much shit for that comment that everybody uses.
No, I mean, if you, I just meant if you use a Mac or an iPhone, you can't avoid the app.
Even if you were sending texts to an Android, you have to use it.
Look at that typing.
Do you see that?
I typed Discord and notes has said, Disord C.
I think you just need to go to the doctor.
I don't know why you can't type.
Not my typing.
I'm telling you.
Sure.
Sure seems like it.
I'm kind of surprised.
I was actually expecting you all to say something else than messages, because I feel like that
is a very, at least I thought it was a very US thing to have iMessage be sort of the default
where like a lot of places it's.
WhatsApp.
Yeah.
WhatsApp or like, is it WeChat or something?
Signal.
Yeah.
Facebook Messenger is, I don't know, offensive to me.
So iMessage is still kind of like the thing there.
Here is a wannabe America and a lot of people use iPhones.
So we basically just copy you.
Now, Jason, just to be clear, I've given you three points for Discord, not because it's
a terrible choice, but because it's Electron.
Okay.
Well, we're using it as like a broadcasting team here.
What are you talking about?
It's his fault.
Well, if you say it, you'll get three points too.
What's your answer, Martin?
Well, given the shifting definition of chat from what I thought was messaging and that
we're all using Discord and it's really the only one of those things that I use in line
with all of you and our listeners, then I have to answer the same way.
All right.
And you also get three points.
Thank you.
Discord, if you could find a new development framework, that point could be reduced to
two.
How do you know I'm not using Discord in the browser?
You aren't?
Well, you are.
How do you know?
You said I got three points because it's Electron.
Maybe it's not.
Maybe it's WebKit.
Well, see, that's a good point.
Since it was suggested by Jared, Jared Blundy, listener and author of Hey Dingus, the website
or his blog, I've been doing the web app thing in the newest Mac OS with Discord.
So does that change things?
Martin, two points.
Congratulations.
You just lost a point.
You've gone down.
Why do I not get the point?
I think he's saying the same thing.
Are you using it?
Are you doing the web app as well?
That's what I just said.
OK, Jason, two points.
There you go.
Oh my God.
Unfortunately, you're both doing it, so there's no advantage.
Anyway, strong recommendation to listeners to try it because I did it for other apps.
But wow, much better for Discord.
So good one.
Great tip.
Hot tip.
Do we have any other hot tech tips before we move on to bookmarks?
Hot tech tips.
Be careful not to touch an iron that has been left on.
Good hot tech tip.
Jason, do you have a hot tech tip?
A bit personal?
I think my hot tech tip of the day would be if you're having trouble with your internet
connection and you feel like it's not up to what it normally would be, give all of your
switches a double check and make sure they're actually in gigabit versus fast ethernet,
which is 100 megabit.
That's going to be a green light versus an orange blinking light.
And that's going to tell you if things are going well, because I had that issue recently.
And that was the giveaway.
So check your little blinky lights on your devices.
That's a good tech tip.
Unless you're in Australia when that speed doesn't matter.
Okay, on to bookmarks.
Bookmark management.
Jason Burke, what do you use?
I use raindrop.io.
That old boy.
Okay.
Yeah, it's stuck around for a long time.
It has.
I'm not going to reward you a score yet until I hear Martin's.
Safari.
Sorry, I can't categorize that.
Safari.
Of course.
That's not even a bookmark manager, you loser.
That's like a browser with a list of bookmarks.
Do we get bonus points for who has more bookmarks?
I don't think you want bonus points, Jason.
I think you should just keep that information to yourself.
I'm giving Martin one point for stupid Safari and I'm giving Jason two points for raindrop.
And sorry if I got a little personal there, Martin.
I know I am the host.
I'm meant to be above the fray, but that was a challenge for me.
That's all right.
I'm a very kind and forgiving person.
We're all growing as people.
So after bookmarks, a similar service, but perhaps more useful, perhaps more popular.
Read it later.
Oh, yeah.
I've got to ask somebody who's the answer.
Jason, what do you use for read it later?
It's called Reader, I think.
Yeah.
It's called Reader.
The RSS Reader?
No.
Spelled correctly.
R-E-A-D-E-R.
Oh, the one with Readwise Reader?
Yes.
That's the one.
Yeah.
Okay.
Good.
Yep.
Okay.
So, three points.
Wow.
That's a lot of points.
I was trying Safari, but well, I'll let Martin answer and I'll tell you what happened with
Safari.
Okay.
Safari.
Because his answer is Safari.
Safari.
Yes.
Yeah.
Reading list and Safari.
He gets one point because that is very much the default.
Just so you know, Jason, if you'd said Devon Think, that would have been two points.
That would have been the next level of defaultness.
It has a Read it Later service.
Unfortunately, Readwise Reader...
Does it?
Of course it does.
What do I have to like print to PDF and then I can read it later?
Like how do...
That's one way you can do it.
It can ingest anything.
Then you assign it to read later.
We're about two thirds through and I am not feeling confident.
I'll just say.
You are struggling.
This is true.
I don't have any grounds at all where I can get like bonus points.
It might be.
Andrew can decide arbitrarily at the end and see how it lines up with Devon Think or something.
Exactly.
And I've also realized that notes, despite it being having a table feature, it has no
mathematical features in it.
So I'm going to have to transfer all this to Excel to add up.
Oh, that'll be actually really good.
Really good radio while you're doing that.
Just use your brain.
I'm not sure I have the capability.
Yeah, you can.
What about the whole thing like, oh, I saw a young person at the register the other day
and they couldn't count the change.
I hear people say that all the time.
Well that is true.
Next category.
This is the nerd, nerd, loser, business cat section of the game show.
You should feel right at home.
So you're playing by yourself or.
That's a section.
Hang on.
I need an intro sting for that.
Word processing.
Who does word processing anymore?
Seriously.
All right.
Let's find out who does the business processing with the words with Martin.
Pages.
Not in any real business.
You're not.
Give you one point.
It's very Mac default.
Jason, you're working in your corporation.
What are you using?
If I have to write a document, I guess it would be Google Docs.
Because that's what I mean for work, that would make the most sense.
Is that your answer?
Google Docs?
I mean it has to be.
I could say pages, but if I wrote it in pages, I would then have to copy and paste it all
to somewhere that was actually useful because no one can read.
I mean, I guess that's not fair.
We do have pages documents, but it's just not.
It's not the default of where we would keep work documentation.
To be fair, because a lot of this has been answered personally.
So if you had to, do you know what I mean?
Because things like Word and Teams can thrust upon me.
If I'm writing a letter to something for a personal whatever, I don't know if I had to
write a letter to like...
The local newspaper.
Yeah, then it would be pages for sure.
I'm giving you that.
It's the only thing that I can stand looking at to write in from a processing document
standpoint.
Okay.
Okay, that's good.
Okay, next step.
I think we can probably just knock the next two categories out the same, just copy and
paste below.
Yeah, probably right.
It's the same suite of apps.
Yeah, spreadsheets, presentations, numbers and keynotes.
Shopping lists.
What do we got here from Martin?
What do you shop with?
Natasha and I use a shared note in Notes.
Notes?
Yep.
Okay.
Right.
Look at that.
That typing is ridiculous.
This is so buggy.
I'm filing a radar.
I think you have some kind of weird like anti-autocorrect going on because it typed it right and then
it switched on you.
I think you got something weird going on over there.
Still.
All right.
I'm not giving it a score until I hear Jason's answer.
Yeah.
I would love to say reminders, but if I change where we store our shopping list one more
time, I don't think that's going to be good for me.
So we are still in any list.
Fantastic app.
I swear by it.
Love it.
I want to give you one point because it's so good, but it's not default.
So I've got to give you two.
I'm sorry.
But Martin, you're getting three.
Because that's not correct.
No, but it is.
Is it a default app?
Is it a default app?
It is.
Right.
But it's not default for shopping lists.
You have decided personally with your own subjective bias that it isn't.
So I will not be penalized in this way.
That's an official complaint.
I'm the host.
I will have you removed if this is put through.
I'm taking it on board.
But no, let me explain.
I'm not rushing after the scoring.
Oh, rubbish.
Okay.
Reminders has a classification system.
You can type carrots and it puts it in the right area now.
Great.
That is your default grocery list.
Is it called shopping.app?
No, let me finish.
Exactly.
And recently they said, oh, you can now do dot points or bullet point lists for to do's
or shopping and stuff.
So it's an option provided in a default app by Apple.
But any list is better.
So is it a default app?
It gets two points.
He needs to be rewarded.
Meal planning.
Meal planning.
Do you do your meal planning in notes, Martin felt?
Yes, it goes hand in hand with the shopping list.
Because notes as a default app allows you to write more, hence making meal planning
easier.
Hmm.
Okay.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Default is that even tables as you're using right here, you could line things up if you
wanted to.
Okay.
I'm giving you two points for that.
Okay.
Jason, what do you use for meal planning?
Of all the 97 episodes, I can't believe this is the one where he's going to quit the show.
This is amazing.
I don't, I guess calendar.
I mean, what are you asking for with meal planning?
Like what day we're eating what?
Yeah.
What day?
What's the recipe?
I mean, you're just cooking food.
I don't really need like a fancy recipe for Monday through Friday.
Jason, you're getting three points because you're an idiot because you're using any list
for your shopping list, but you're not using it for meal planning that it also has built
into the app and it's brilliant.
And it cross links to the recipe.
That's true, but A, I don't need a recipe because I already know what we're doing.
And then B, if it's a time-based thing, it belongs on a calendar.
Quick question, Andrew, when you were like a management and business consultant, did
you engage with your clients in this way?
Three points.
You're an idiot.
That's not how you run a business.
When I felt they could take it.
Yes.
That's why I don't do that job anymore.
I think it all caught up with me.
Okay.
Type 45.
This is the best category in the entire competition.
I'm so excited to be introducing this category.
And if you'd like to talk about it at length, I'm more than comfortable to spare the time
to do so.
We have a category of budgeting and personal finance.
Look how he shoved like the whole category in there.
I'm surprised you didn't put like taxes and all.
It's very tempting.
I knew you wouldn't have it.
You're going to give me a lot of points.
I don't, there's, I don't, I don't know.
Do you want to revise that answer, Jason?
Because you might get 20 for that answer.
I put, I put everything in that green book app one time, but I never look at it.
Do you use a banking app?
I mean, yeah, I use, I don't do anything with it.
I just look at it every once in a while or like scan a check to deposit it.
Does that count?
We don't have checks in Australia.
It's pretty pathetic.
Okay.
I'm just going to leave it blank.
Oh, what's that thing that, what's that thing into it bought?
I got stuff in there.
What is it called?
Mint?
Oh, mint.
Is that, is that something I have that in there so I can see my, my net worth?
Does that count?
Am I using the right words?
Yeah.
We never got mint in Australia.
I was very, very upset about that for years wanting, wanting it.
So I'm going to give you, I don't even know what points to give you.
I'm going to wait and see what Martin says.
Okay.
Martin, budgeting and personal finance.
So basically I just use my banking app cause that's where all the information about my
accounts is.
And it offers a really good kind of monthly budgeting report, which shows automatically
the categories that you've been spending on and where stuff goes.
So I don't look at it religiously, but it's handy to have it there.
And I look at it occasionally.
He won.
He said like budgeting and stuff.
That means he got better points than I did.
He did, but you know what?
I don't do it enthusiastically.
I'm being honest to you, Jason.
I'm not trying to win through some deceptive act here.
I know, but I think you, I think you had more words that ticked boxes than I did.
I think.
You'd be surprised to see what Martin is doing.
Martin is reporting.
He is being reactive, not proactive.
He's not planning.
He's reporting.
He's looking at where he spent.
If you look where you spent, it's too late.
You can't make a decision.
It's already happened.
It is done.
You are now living with the consequences of the decision.
You need to be planning forward.
Right?
So you need to be deciding before you spend the money, where the money is going to be
spent.
Real time follow up.
I just realized I have a spreadsheet that tracks all monthly costs of the household
for the past three years.
Which he uses so seldom that he forgot about it.
Okay.
That's got to count.
Because what app is the spreadsheet in?
Numbers.
Spreadsheet in numbers.
Okay.
Because Jason, you hit the word spreadsheet.
Three years of data.
Three years of data.
And because you use numbers, you're getting one point.
All right.
Martin, thank you.
Yes.
If we want to get particular in semantic now about what the word default means, right?
Because you pinged me before for, oh, that's not where you would put a shopping list.
Stop talking.
I'm speaking now.
The default app for managing your money would be the banking app where your money resides.
So I am using the one and only default option.
The one and only default app option.
Two words, not one.
Where my money is.
So ultimately, I'm more default than Jason in that category.
Damn it.
That's a good argument.
It's actually a good argument.
Bloody good one.
But you know what?
Australian banks suck.
Two points.
I have formulas.
Onto news.
No argument.
Just he is correct.
Okay.
Onto news.
Martin Feld, what do you read your news with?
What do I read my news with?
How do you consume your news?
Really I prefer listening to the radio while I'm driving than reading news.
But if I had to read it, I would read it.
You don't have to read it.
No, no.
But I'm saying when I do.
AM radio.
AM radio could be your choice.
FM.
I like to actually hear what's happening.
It's like something happened.
That's all I ever hear.
Anyway, if I had to read news, which I do occasionally, it would be on a website like
ABC News in Safari.
So my answer would be Safari.
Okay.
All right.
What was that look?
I'm holding off on a score.
Jason, where do you get your news from?
It definitely seems less fair when you're waiting to score.
Well it's ridiculous.
I read my news in a previous category, RSS, and I also listen to the Apple News Today
Daily podcast.
It's like 10, 10-ish minutes every morning of just kind of like all the horrible things
that are happening in the world so I can just really start my day off on a high.
Actually you're right because I read stuff in RSS as well, but I didn't really think
of it as news.
So I'd probably add that to mine.
But that's more the tech news or blog area than world events or something.
Interesting.
This is a tough one to score.
It's very tough when you're making it up as you go along.
It is.
I'm going to give you Martin one point because he's using Safari.
He's also using the best source of news in Australia and that is ABC.
So one point for you.
Jason, Apple News Today sounds like something very US-centric and that pisses me off.
So two points.
Do you know for certain?
No, just assuming.
Okay, we have only got three categories left.
Three categories.
This is where the rubber hits the road, fellas.
If you want to get to fault, now's the time to default the S out of it.
And we've left the best to last.
Yes, this is the category everybody's interested in.
Music.
What's the third last?
Well, yeah, third last.
It's a triumvirate of last.
Gotcha.
So Martin, how do you listen to music?
Music.
Good answer.
More specifically, Apple Music through all the different devices.
Yeah, I gotcha.
That is a solid one point.
No arguments there.
Jason Burke, even though they're putting the prices up, sticking with it.
Jason Burke, what do you got for music?
Napster.
Yes.
Because the prices are going up.
Usually it's AirPods or HomePods is how I usually listen to music.
Interesting.
We're talking software.
Audio OS 17.1.
Okay, I'm calling that Apple Music because I'm sure that's what you're trying to say.
I don't think you're a Spotify guy.
No, no, absolutely not.
Okay, there's one piece of audio entertainment that is more impactful, more enjoyable, more
powerful, more wonderful than music, and that's podcasts.
I've heard of those.
Hemisphericviews.com, like and subscribe.
And another podcast you got to listen to.
You know what I'm going to say.
Do you guys know what I'm going to say?
The other podcast that you have to listen to?
There are a lot of them.
I don't know which one.
I do.
Jason, you know what to say.
Ruminate.
There it is.
I wondered if you meant that one.
Because they said they were going to stop talking about us, so we're going to keep doing
it so they feel bad.
Hey, Rob.
Hey, John.
I wonder if John Voorhees will ever actually start listening to our podcast or just keep
hearing about Hemispheric Views and going, huh, that's a podcast.
He spoke very highly of it in the last show.
The last Ruminate show.
So.
Well, hi, John.
Thanks for listening.
And Rob.
Thanks everyone, basically.
We appreciate that you're here.
Yeah.
Especially that Ruminate podcast.
Love the new artwork.
Are we doing podcasts now?
Yeah, yeah, Martin.
What are you listening to?
What are you using for podcasts?
Overcast.
And I'm ready to defend it in the default world.
Sex.
I'm not.
Really torn here.
I'm giving it two.
It's two points.
Might be like an 11.
It's probably an 11.
I'm giving him two.
Jason Bourke, podcasts?
I use Apple Podcasts.
Do you?
Yep.
Seriously?
Seriously.
For the last month and a half.
He has an aneurysm every time he looks at the notes, but he pushes on.
Which is why I've added at the top of all the notes now, if you're using Apple Podcasts,
go here instead.
But it's actually been really great.
The sync has been glorious.
I don't have to even worry about it being sped up incorrectly, like people think is
the right way to listen.
It plays it at 1x, like the podcast heavens intended.
And it's great.
Sounds good.
Who's got time for something that doesn't have smart speed?
But that is a one point for you and Apple Podcasts, as much as it pains me to deliver
it.
Martin, was there anything you wanted to say about Overcast?
Do you feel that two points is fair or are you angry?
That's fine.
I just said I was ready to defend it if there were an attack, but I'm satisfied with that.
I think it should be at least three or four.
Well, okay.
Here's the defense.
It is somewhat the default for the tech podcasting community.
False.
No, I'm just saying I think that justifies it being a two.
It's not the default option, but it is very much a default option within the fandom that
we operate.
Popular does not equal default.
No, becomes somewhat default or a de facto default through its popularity.
A lot of people making the wrong decision does not make a right.
I don't know why.
Actually, why am I arguing this?
It's fair.
One versus two.
Anyway, Andrew, grand pooh bar of scoring.
Yeah, give him a six and let's move on to the last category.
Gentlemen, I felt like I was in a presidential debate there.
Thank you.
That was very excellent.
And I was the compare being completely spoken over.
We need to argue at least like one of them.
I know.
It's totally fair.
The final category, the final entry, a controversial one and one of much interest of many people,
particularly more recently.
Before I get to it, it's another final audio sting.
Are you ready?
Okay, here we go.
See what I can do here.
It's the final category.
The final category is password management.
Martin Feld, defending champion.
This is your final answer.
If he says keychain, I swear to God.
I cloud keychain and Safari.
Me.
Come on.
It's never let me down.
It's very easy.
Yeah, no stress.
It's great.
And if something is compromised, you get the notification.
You can deal with it.
Easy.
Oh my gosh.
Wow.
Okay.
I cloud keychain.
Jason Burke, your password manager of choice.
Does it even really matter at this point?
One password.
And when I say that, I mean, I use the same password for everything.
That's pretty default.
Honestly, look, one password, one password.
It's not default, but it.
I would argue though, among the nerd crowd, it is the default option.
Nice one.
I agree.
And I was, I was this close to giving you one point for that until I remembered that
they too switched to that stupid electron framework.
Two points.
Just fix that up.
Fix that up.
That brings us to the end of our scoring challenge.
Now I can, I can tally these up.
Shall I tally them up?
Okay.
Play some music.
Now, the score, the scores after the scoring rounds.
Defending champion, Mr. Default, the felled foot, racked in 33 points.
And as a reminder, lower score is better score in the world of defaults.
Wait, did we already say we're not doing any bonus questions?
Is that correct?
Oh, no, there's still time.
I just told you, hold your horses.
My horses are held.
Jason, the challenger, Jason Burke, he'd been in training.
Looks like he needs to go back to the gym because against Martin's score of 33, Jason
Burke, 38, five default points behind the defending champion.
Pretty impressive.
So from the scoring rounds that we've had so far, Martin, you are the winner.
Congratulations.
Do you have anything you'd like to say?
Thank you.
I do appreciate it.
It's been a very fun competition.
Say that, say that, because we're not finished yet.
I'm just saying that...
We're not finished yet.
Okay, whatever.
Because you can say it, but I'm going to make you say it in a format for the game show.
You need to now in free speaking form, justify your default lifestyle and tell me why using
default apps is better than using custom bespoke third party ones.
As the defending champion and the winner of the scoring contest, Martin, you get to go
second.
It gives you some time to think.
All right.
So Jason, off you go.
So picture this.
You're on a beautiful sailboat cruising the Mediterranean.
The sun is setting in the background.
The weather is perfect.
The beverage is the perfect temperature.
You think sunset photo would be the right choice right now.
You raise your phone up, you take the perfect sunset photo, and all of a sudden a dolphin
jumps out of the water and knocks your phone into the ocean and down to the bottom it goes.
Oh no, we had no signal.
What are we going to do?
So you quickly sail back to the coast and go to the Apple store and buy a new phone
and open it up and turn it on.
Poof.
All of your apps are already there and sinking the second you turn it on.
No fiddling with the app store, no logging in.
It's all just there.
And then you get back on your boat and you go back out and finish the sunset.
End of story.
Great story.
Okay.
Thank you, Jason.
Really painted a picture.
Martin Feld, in defense of default apps, you have the floor.
No stress, no friction, and I know where everything is.
Fin.
I feel very seen and I felt targeted by that comment.
Not intended.
I like the fin though.
That really felt like one of those silent movies.
It was great.
It was lovely as well because it tied into your story with the dolphin because dolphins
have fins.
It's like you're working together.
I could have ended with a flipper but that would have been more comical.
Yeah.
Wouldn't have had the same effect.
Yeah.
I'm definitely using that in an upcoming show.
That's definitely a sound.
Yeah.
I got to put that in my Thwip app, which is my default app for soundboards.
Look, they were both great stories.
Unfortunately for Jason, they didn't move the needle.
I like them both equivalently.
So the winner of our duel of the defaults and back to back champion, holding the nickname
of Mr. Default for another year, Martin Feld.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much, Andrew.
And I want to extend a heartfelt congratulations and acknowledgement to Jason, who I think
has struck a beautiful balance in making his life more default, but maintaining the options
and creativity that he obviously enjoys.
Thank you.
I'd like to thank the Academy.
I'd like to thank all the listeners.
I'd like to thank Fantastical for making a calendar that can in fact actually show weak
numbers.
So although I am sad that I lost today, I am not defeated and I will be back.
On behalf of Hemispheric Views and all the participants, this is Andrew Canyon saying
thanks and see you again next fortnight.
I can't believe I fucking lost.
Why did I lose?
