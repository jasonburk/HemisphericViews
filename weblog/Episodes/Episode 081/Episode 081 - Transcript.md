(upbeat music)
- Martin, you've just hit us
with some pretty intense computing technology here.
So why don't you take it away?
- Yeah, look, listeners check out the podcast artwork
or a link in the show notes.
We were just having a chat before even starting to record.
And I said, no, we have to start recording
because Natasha is at IKEA at the moment
and she sent this photo of a fake Mac laptop.
It's hilarious.
It's kind of got Snow Leopard era vibes
mixed with modern liquid retina display.
Jason, you said it was similar or different.
What were you saying before I cut you off?
- Oh, I was just curious because you said that,
I think anybody who's been to an IKEA before
like knows that they have fake props
or whatever you wanna call it.
to try to jazz up the spaces to make them look like
you could actually, oh, this is like my,
this could be my house.
So I was curious if you had similar props
or if they were gonna be completely different.
And it turns out they are completely different.
This is what I would describe as like a piece of cardboard
folded in a laptop shape with a printout of a screen
from 2004 maybe put on there.
And then the keys are also kind of glued on there
in a weird sort of way.
It's, I'm not gonna lie,
it's actually kind of a cool laptop.
It's like the reverse of what we have now
where the body is black and the keyboard is white.
- And the speaker grills.
- And the speaker grills are very pronounced, yes.
- I'm very curious though about some of the things
that they've obviously adjusted.
So for a start, the keys show what appears
to be the old kind of like VAG rounded,
like pre San Francisco.
But then in some spots it looks really different.
Like the one, two, and maybe three,
they look a bit different.
Like the font doesn't look right.
- They're like a different font.
- Yeah, it's a flat top on the three.
- Yeah, and then you look at the icons
and it's like some of them have been altered
because they don't wanna have copyright problems,
but then not all of them.
- It's so weird.
- So like find a Skype part of Spotify.
I don't think Spotify was around then, was it?
this year of computer i don't think so no not as an app surely i was probably like a
web service or whatever but yeah the icons that are like it's like there's a it's like
a psd with layer and icons for some reason unlike everything else are in like six layers
and somebody just accidentally turned off some of the layers before they printed it
and i'm trying to get go to the hardware i mean there's dents in the uh in the trackpad
And in the wrist rest area of the keyboard,
it's had a hard life, this laptop.
- I imagine that this folder structure on the desktop though
is exactly the same as Martin's desktop.
And that's why it was sent to him.
(laughing)
- Martin would love that.
- What with Windows layout on the left.
- No, thank you. - It's just five folders.
One is called folder, which is great.
(laughing)
Just in case you weren't sure what that icon was.
Then you have docs.
- Of course.
have picture, not pictures, just one photo.
And then work and games.
It's a Mac. There's no games. Give me a break.
You know what I am troubled about, though?
It appears they might be off by a pixel or two, but when you look at those folders, it's like there's been that careful arrangement or snap to grid.
Yeah.
HD on the right is not following that convention.
It's not. No.
So it's like they snapped to grid for the folders and then went just put this external device anywhere.
I just wonder how is it?
How is a device?
I'm not seeing a USB device plugged into this cardboard laptop.
So where is HD?
You are correct.
This is very odd.
They must have not safely ejected and it's just lingering.
This was a delight.
So thank you for sharing.
Because we were literally in this store not too long ago.
And I was actually thinking, imagine there's gotta be some department that's in charge of manufacturing all of these fake setups.
And it just seems like that would be fun for maybe like a day or two.
Just to come up with like this screen, except it would take me probably like four months to perfect like the in jokes for this kind of screen.
And I would be fired.
Yeah.
Who's the...
Haven't we done an Ikea disc review?
Purely by accident and thanks Natasha for sending it.
This is totally on brand for us.
Like I can always count on my wife to look out for crap like this when she's out and about and we're gonna have to look up what on earth the products are around this.
It's a scrut and a fransolg.
I've always wanted a fransolg.
Always, especially at that price 39 bucks.
Are you kidding me?
That's a steal.
Australian.
That's tax inclusive as well.
Oh man.
I just need to wish an apology I've just realised my Mike levels have been jumping up and down what's going on I keep resetting them to normal and then I realise it's peaking and all that kind of stuff.
That doesn't sound good.
My zoom was set to automatically adjust my volume I never do that why would my zoom not be set up correctly because I'm on a new computer.
Oh Segway there he goes just zoom in by on his Segway which I for that cliff so Martin if you're editing this episode I'm sorry if I can do something about it.
That's right how is that new Samsung laptop going.
It's better than the IKEA one.
I don't know that actually could be a contender for comparison so yeah you have the Samsung yoga L6.
No it's not right at all I'm an LG household don't get the same.
I want to say fellas you guys have been hassling me for a long time about my Intel iMac.
Yes it's all we do and how it's.
I think I've been pretty kind I think it was something else but I'm labeled the foot so.
You gently nudged Jason has just abused me consistently about his.
Yeah I tied a note around a brick and drove by his house and threw it through the window.
All the way to Perth to throw that brick then got back on a plane flew back to Portland never even said hello.
I'm at sucks.
Anyway I I finally agree my Mac does suck it has been relegated to secondary computer status good for it I have promoted my MacBook Air.
with 16 gigabytes of RAM to full mobile workstation status docking to the cinema this is my studio display at home and so now I've really got this is my go to one device the old iMac is now satellite it's there I put it near near a couch I can watch TV on it.
Can you hear the TV over the fans and nothing or.
It's glorious this new setup is amazing and I just want to fully endorse the concept of
laptop as portable workstation I did this a few years ago with my old 13 inch MacBook Pro
that had an Intel Accord i5 whatever it was.
I didn't love it but this new world where the battery lasts forever
you just plug it in with one one cord one thunderbolt cable and everything is alive.
Oh man, it's beautiful. It is absolutely beautiful. No power cords, no extra USBs. Oh man, this is amazing guys.
And it just changes everything. And for me, like I use my computer relatively heavily. I'm not a programmer or anything.
But the M1 with 16GB of RAM is still tremendously enough for me. I have not feel like I'm lacking in any way.
So goodbye iMac, hello M1. I am in 2020 guys.
- Welcome to the very near past.
- It's a delight.
- But it's a good point you bring up
because when the studio display came out,
everyone complained about it, right?
But it's quite clearly made for people
who have a certain preference within the Mac world
who want it, right?
It fits your needs.
And if it isn't for you, no worries.
Let's move on, buy another display.
So singular cable, you love it.
- And this webcam seems fine to me.
I know people bitch about it
and it's not as good as an iPhone,
but seriously, I don't look that great.
If a blurry camera is like installed, it's probably a pro.
- Oh, look, if it makes you feel any better, Andrew,
about the purchase,
I can see all of your imperfections beautifully.
Very crisp.
- Yeah. - Awesome.
(laughing)
- Yay.
I even told Zoom to touch up my appearance.
Is that what that kind of sparkly,
pink star halo is around your head at the moment?
Why are you wearing blush?
I know this isn't a really traditionally a computer show.
Isn't it?
But can I expand a little bit on,
uh, on your,
what you're putting down there,
Andrew?
Sure.
Would that be all right?
Yeah,
I think so.
If Martin will allow it.
A couple of things here.
Uh,
I hope so.
We'll see.
He'll,
he'll,
he'll give me the hook when,
when it's time to stop.
You mentioned that you did this with an Intel computer,
Intel laptop specifically with a display
and it was sort of like, eh, it's okay.
I have come to a similar realization recently
in that I used to be laptop primary computer person
with external display and it always kind of sucked.
The computer wasn't ever enough
and it was pain in the ass to get it all working
And it was just never as, it wasn't the dream
that it seemed like it could be.
Flash forward to now, so I had,
I then switched to just doing iMacs and desktops only,
'cause it was like, I want my computer to be good,
so I'm gonna use a desktop.
Recently, something similar happened to me
that happened to you in that I switched everything
back to a laptop.
And this new Apple Silicon world
has really changed the dynamic
of this primary computer being a laptop
connected to an external display to be your quote desktop.
And it all works so incredibly well now
that I'm back on team primary laptop.
I don't think it's a surprise to anybody
that all I've been talking about lately
is how I'm going to replace my 24 inch iMac.
And I've gone through basically every iteration
that's possible inside the apple.com store.
Apologies to everyone that's had to suffer
through this longstanding nightmare with me.
And laptop was never on the table
'cause I didn't think that this was the right way to go
still because of preconceived notions.
So now I'm back on team laptop
and I'm here to fully support you on your decision
is what I wanna say.
And also side note,
I totally forgot the term studio display
used to be a thing prior to the cinema displays.
I don't know how I forgot that.
- They were the big CRT things, yeah.
- With the feet?
- Originally there was a huge,
and if I've got the right one,
it was a gigantic, super heavy,
iMac-esque kind of transparent thing
where you could see all the CRT stuff in the back
and it was on a transparent stand.
My dad actually found one at a vintage shop years ago
and brought it home, but unfortunately it kind of rusted out
in the inside and didn't turn on,
but it was the heaviest thing I've ever picked up in my life
that wasn't like another human.
Yeah, it was beautiful.
- I don't know why I,
I think I just erased that part of history from my mind,
but I at one point called this a cinema display as well,
because we had them forever.
Like that 27 was,
it was sold for like 35 years or something.
It was just like always there.
But yeah, the studio display was totally a thing before.
So it doesn't really mean anything.
I just thought it was interesting, but team laptop.
And that's why at the beginning of the show, looping back around, we did question whether
this recording was going to work because both Jason and I are now running totally brand
new setups.
And did we test it beforehand?
Nah.
Nah.
Nah, we've just assumed it to work.
Just on the cinema display, I will just, we talked about they lasted forever.
I did acquire my original cinema display on the 15th of January, 2011.
I disposed of it on the 8th of February, 2021.
Okay.
And how many dollars per week is that now?
So that worked out as of that date of disposal.
That was $2.09 per week.
I purchased it for $1,299.
I resold it 10 years later for $200, which I think is a great deal.
So there you go.
That's the value of having an IT asset lifespan spreadsheet on hand at all times.
Well, that's I mean, with that kind of money, you can go back and get like five of those
screws that go with the cardboard laptop.
Perfect.
Done deal.
salga way. We're so close. I don't even know what I said. That doesn't even make sense.
I just wanted to say it. Can't wait till we see what that translates to.
We just lost a whole heap of Scandinavian Muslims. They're all gone. How dare him?
What did Martin call us? Did you just call us a fransalg? Can you believe it? We've not heard
that word in hundreds of years. It's probably like an archaic Nordic insult.
We just had the new guy from Finland join us and well that was fun while it lasted.
Yeah goodbye.
See you Matty.
It's Matty right?
We got Furstenberg just going no don't say that why would you say that?
He is kind of like our Scandinavian ambassador isn't he?
Speaking for all the nations yeah.
He sure is.
We've got photography corner but this is less about devices or photography as a
general topic this is a specific app that has made a return and I'm seeing a basketball next to it
Andrew what do you have to say have you been testing something out well I have been I've
been testing out Hipstamatic oh okay Hipstamatic is back as skeuomorphic as ever maybe even more
so it's like I'm back in time I'm assuming that Martin Feld has tried this out it is I haven't
actually. Wow, okay. So it's so skeuomorphic and sort of you basically it's like you're creating
just highly stylized photos. People probably might not know Hipstamatic but they might
remember the original Instagram where it was all about taking photos and then applying those
filters because the camera in the iPhone was so cruddy that the filters actually gave you
something to work with. So Hipstamatic is a bit like that. It has filters that you can apply so
you can distort your photo in all sorts of ways and it has this concept of using different cameras
you know like an instant camera or a Polaroid camera a Lomo camera you know the old traditional
kind of multiple modes. You can do this editing and then you share it to the network but it only
lasts it's like a disposable photo so it lasts on their servers for four weeks and then goes away
And so there's a bit of a social component of it,
but it's not an everlasting social element.
And other people can come in and like it
and give you little stamps of approval
and that kind of thing.
And you get this, it's almost like a passport.
So when you take a photo, it'll stamp the location of it.
So I got a stamp for posting a photo from Australia
and it looked like a passport stamp,
had a little kangaroo on it and looked very realistic.
It was quite gorgeous.
And you get other stamps if you do consecutive days
and that kind of thing.
So it's that kind of gamification tied into it as well.
But it just all looks absolutely gorgeous.
But because of its gorgeousness
and its multiple sort of efforts at being a photo editor
and a photo taker, and you've got the different cameras,
and then it's trying to upsell you
to the subscription plan, which is fine
'cause they've got costs, I don't mind that.
I haven't gone to that level
'cause I'm not sure I'm really into it enough.
But because there's all these modes and the social aspect,
pretty bloody confusing.
I'm always like, what, what, what, what mode am I in?
Like I'm just mashing buttons on the screen,
trying to figure out how do I jump from this to that?
I don't know if that's my age,
I've become an old person that can't program a VCR.
I don't know if it's just, you know,
version one of an app and they're still figuring it out,
or I don't know if it's entirely bad design.
I'm kind of flummoxed by it, but I love the idea of it.
Because it's going back to sort of that Instagram.
Instagram became SkyMall, right?
It's just selling products and selling lifestyles
that people don't lead.
This is more like, I like taking photos,
but I just want to be a bit ridiculous with it.
And I just want to shoot fun photos
of stuff that I've seen in the world.
And so I admire the intent of the app.
So it's a little bit old man shouting at clouds meets old man,
taking pictures of clouds. Is that sort of where we're at here?
I think so. I think so.
So I found one other hemispherian out there I found,
cause I was like, who likes photos? Who else would I know that would be on this app?
Can you guys guess who that might be?
Mike.
Nailed it. Mike. Straight on there. He was there before me.
So I was able to find him and of course his photos are like 6,000 times better than mine
But I'd be interested to know what Mike thinks of
This app because he is totally in that photo world in the same way like you guys are probably more in the photo world these
Days than I am I continue to maintain my Flickr subscription
But that's about as much as I've got going on in the photo world at the moment fair enough
Yeah, I saw hipstamatic came back out and I thought well, that'd be cool to try and then I went
No, because I have enough places to put photos not to sound like a wet blanket
But there's flicker which I kind of put some things in when I want to share with people
You know stuff that's not in my library
I've got just my photos library then I've got glass and then I have micro dot blog and I kind of have a different
purpose for all of these things
having an extra one just seemed like
The service looks lovely, but I have no reason for this
Yeah, so it'll be interesting to know if you actually stick it out
I don't think I will look that's my early call
I think it's fun to play with but I don't love it enough to pay for it and
You don't really get the full experience unless you pay for it. So I'm kind of this
Difficult situation I admire them, but it's just not for me. I think it's cool and it looks it's it looks fun
It's a little bit spoiled for me because there was another app
That did the same thing where it was from back in the day and now all of a sudden it's back with a 2.0
And that was Goala. I don't know if either of you have heard of that. But it was back in the days
when doing like check-ins was really popular. There was like Foursquare and Goala and maybe
a few others. And Goala, I always, I preferred that one. I thought that one was always the best.
It was the most fun and kind of had similar thing where you get like little stickers and all that
kind of crap. Like it didn't do anything. But at the time, at that point in the internet,
it was the right time for it.
So when it came back, I was like, Oh, go wallah.
It was like, Oh, give me the test flay.
I want to try it out.
And I installed it and then realized it's 2023.
All I'm doing is helping you like populate a database of where locations are for
things.
And it just was very much like, this is not the time for this anymore.
Like the time has passed.
But anyway, then when I saw Hipstamatic, I sort of, I fell in the same nostalgia
I was like, "Oh, Hipstamatic is back!"
And it was like, "Wait a minute, wait a minute,
"wait a minute, hold on here.
"Slow down, don't just go installing stuff because..."
And I did install it 'cause I was genuinely curious
if it was different or if they literally just
made it work with iOS 16 now.
So there's the social component,
which I'll be perfectly honest,
the last thing I need is another social thing.
I already can't be at all the places that I'm at now.
So adding another one's not gonna help that situation.
And also it's photos, and that seems so much
like less ephemeral than words to me.
So like, I don't wanna go through a bunch of effort
to put photos in a place
where they're just gonna disappear.
I don't really get the point of that.
And I'm not saying it's good, bad, or indifferent.
For me, it's just not the right thing.
And I already have glass,
which I feel like is still for me
like the most kind of pure photo only community thing
and it's just enough.
I don't need the like super engagement there.
I don't even really need the appreciations or anything,
but it's nice that when I have a second,
I can go in and like see a bunch of nice photos
and then leave if I want, or you know,
maybe some interaction, but that was sort of where it ended.
And to your point of it being confusing,
Which you mentioned two references. You mentioned a VCR, which probably 90% of our audience doesn't know what that is.
And then you mentioned SkyMall, which arguably is probably less of a reference anyone's going to get.
But I appreciate the effort.
Yeah, I appreciate the effort.
So I got it.
I understood the context of what you were saying, but I actually didn't know what it was.
There it is.
So I was like, well, I get the joke.
Hang on, you don't get the VCR or SkyMall?
Which one don't you understand?
I know what a VCR is. I remember rewinding those before I took those back to the shop.
Oh, good man.
The VHS.
90% of our audience and a third of our hosts.
Don't get your reference on that one.
- So SkyMall, just quick explanation
for what that was specifically.
- You're on an airplane, you're trapped.
You have nowhere you can go.
So what do you do?
You throw a book in front of somebody
that's full of a bunch of really stupid shit
that you don't really need,
but you've been on that plane for like 16 hours
and you're just looking for anything at this point.
You're like, you know what?
I definitely need a full like massage chair for $16,000 let me get the little phone out of the headrest slide my credit card and I'll have a sweet massage chair when I get home.
So it's why did you a baggage collection.
Exactly right okay because I remember seeing books and catalogs like that but is SkyMall the American term for it is that it.
It was the American magazine it was.
Yeah.
That was the name of the catalog.
And I think it kind of became a Kleenex thing where just any magazine in an airplane that sold you shit was basically, oh, SkyMall.
Okay.
Qantas still do this, Martin.
I think you go on Qantas and they still do Qantas shopping.
Yeah.
It's that, it's that store in the mall that has all that dumb crap, but it's in a magazine on an airplane.
It's basically the same thing.
Yeah.
No, I have seen things like that on flights.
But when you said SkyMall, I thought, is this part of like the Epcot vision for the future?
Like there was some sort of mall in the sky that Walt Disney wanted or something?
Oh, if only, if only.
Yeah.
So just, I'll just, just wrapping on the, the hypnotic thing for the confusion part you
mentioned, arguably the part that made me not want to use it the most is that it passes
that threshold of too many options.
And now there's, I don't know, 200 lenses I can pick,
500 different kinds of film, 40,000 kinds of cameras,
and any of those mixed together can get a new output.
So it's just like, it's too much.
It's just too much.
So it's neat.
I do love that it's like, looks so skeuomorphic.
I actually kind of appreciate that,
but I don't think I'll be using it for anything.
- There we go.
- Yeah, it's dramatic.
(upbeat music)
we have a new One Prime Plus in.
- What?
When did that happen?
- Yeah, I don't know, people keep signing up.
- I don't know what these people are doing.
- I don't know.
And there is an episode to come.
Keep your eyes on the feed, people.
- That would be the super secret feed
for those that aren't in the know.
- Now, who is this person?
- Our newest One Prime Plus.com member, Ryan D.
Thank you, Ryan, for joining OnePrimePlus.com.
We're glad that somehow someone convinced you
to join oneprimeplus.com.
Don't forget, benefits, there's always benefits, right?
You gotta get in the Discord, first of all.
Everybody's in there, that's a great place.
Side note, probably my favorite place
on the internet right now, gotta say.
So you got the Discord.
If you want stickers, we have stickers.
All you have to do is shoot us an address
of where you'd like those sent.
Anywhere in the northern or southern hemisphere. They're available all the way around the entire globe
for our one prime plus members
Also, there's bonus episodes. So when you join one prime plus you get a super secret
Super secret super cast feed say that 600 times fast
And that gives you all the bonus episodes. So there's two feeds
You got the regular feed and you got the super secret feed
So you're gonna want both of those and I'm sure there's other benefits that I'm blanking on well funny you say that oh, yes
I mean you had the live watch just before this recording. So yeah Tetris. I hope that went well
I couldn't attend but really thank you for being our live stream man. There will be a new members episode coming soon
I've just been too busy. So thanks for waiting. Yep. Hello wonderful subscribers and
Very important news to share there was a poll on discord
Do you want a newsletter that only comes from Martin?
Oh, no.
The people spoke. Apparently they love me.
They prefer me to both of you.
I didn't know that was the case.
Ideal.
But...
No, maybe not that far.
But there will be a Martin-only hemispheric news coming in the near future.
You might regret having voted yes in that poll.
Maybe.
See what ends up in your inbox.
Are we gonna call that...
"Hemispheric views"?
I think it should be hemispheric.
It's so good.
It's just sitting there.
I don't know if the art department has enough bandwidth to really get that done, but we'll
check with them.
The people have spoken.
Do we get to read that too?
Or I hope so.
I guess if we subscribe, we have to subscribe.
You two have no choice.
You have to listen to what I say.
No, I mean the newsletter. Yeah, that's what I mean. Okay, audio, whatever. Perfect. It'll be there for you. I remember signing the contract. Okay.
The other thing you get as part of One Prime Plus is an ad-free feed. Hang on. Everybody gets that.
Which is a good thing because I've been hearing a lot of podcasts talk about how the podcast ad market is kind of rough right now.
You don't get any ads without show it's amazing thing this show is entirely listen to support it with those one prime plus Ian's so we greatly appreciate it because we don't have a hover or a.
Mattress place or anything and that's by design yeah Squarespace even you know like throwing these names out there I give a shit square space piss off don't care.
So we don't have those ads the only ad we have.
Is canyon dot blog slash save there is and that is we appreciate everybody who.
Visit that site and of course follows a link.
Yes, we collectively, all three of us really appreciate when you visit that site.
It helps all of us greatly.
Mainly me, but you know, like.
It's true.
Look, yeah, this is not some super business.
This is just three guys sitting in their studies talking crap to each other.
And we're not even like the fascist white podcaster type.
You know, we're not getting ad revenue.
We're not backed by super right-wing think tanks fueling a stereotype of male podcasters.
We're just three guys not in the ad market so is that why we are now poised for professional input about the ad market Andrew that's that's the Segway three guys who don't do ads are gonna talk about ads.
No that's all I had really.
Oh wow.
Put a lot put a lot of that segment now just it was interesting that the ad market is taking as Silicon Valley tanks and capital realises that perhaps is better places to go then speculative.
Venture capital efforts as interest rates in cloud increase better off put your money in safer options.
So really what you saying is as a kind of really really well thought out business strategy we never got into ads in the first place.
We've entered business corner yeah you're right man you've got you are you man's or run business corner this point because you're nailing it we are three steps ahead of the market we saw.
The surge in advertising and we thought no we don't want a part of that because we know that on the other side of the surge is a cliff.
Alright and that clip it get you get accustomed to that revenue you start to live the lifestyle that revenue afford you.
Suddenly revenue drives up your lifestyle you're in trouble you can't you can't keep going and then the podcast itself you think I stuff it was gonna shut down because we can't afford to operate.
We take a different view we've gone long game Jason where is it.
It's in the long game.
So next up in the show notes I can see Andrew people are questioning your tiny.
iPhone tell us more get this is just a really quick one cuz I feel like this has been the Andrew show so I apologize for that.
I just.
Go on.
Just really quickly I just want to say it was you to joke is that convinced me that an iPhone mini was the way to go about 18 months ago it is still have one well it may be the case for you.
I have one to.
Something about me I've complained I think on this show before about the tiny iPhone being too tiny for my fingers and I find it hard to type on it.
Yes, that's one thing that's that's me. I'm living with that for some reason. I don't know why it's just been over the last week or two
I have had multiple people in entirely different circles
Look at my phone and go what is that?
Why have you got such a tiny phone and then I am having to justify myself and say actually it's an iPhone 13 mini
And they're like, oh at least it's a 13 like it's not it looks like it ancient piece of junk
What are you doing and what is that giant white thing magnetized to the back of it not yet my battery pack is the iPhone 13 mini runs out of battery so fast.
I'm getting a lot of negative feedback about my iPhone 13 mini.
So you're conscious of your size that's what this segment about.
Highly conscious highly conscious maybe you should put it in a case.
What the case broke I want spend more money on a case so what is your case that was the size of a pro max lucky to put the mini in the pro max size case.
What guy has in phone like just exactly yeah cut out phone so it was that's not a bad idea but just to be clear when you say a lot of people.
Can we maybe can we dial in a little bit on on the definition of a lot because it sounds like it's it's maybe like one.
No I think it's about four people.
Four people.
Four people in different circumstances with no connection to one another.
Well that's it's right in that kind of grey zone between a few and several that's pretty massive.
And in clinton bordering on a lot.
I'm not happy about it so but I almost upgraded and then I said no no no Andrew you not doing that right now you need to hold out six months get the new phone that has USB C that'll be sweet.
But I just want you to know it's your girls fault that I'm getting heckled for having an iPhone 13 mini.
I take full responsibility for that but it just made me a picture here you're walking down the street I need to I got a text me look at it and all the sudden everyone in the store turns.
Points at you and collectively is laughing out loud at your phone is that more or less.
It was a bit like that yesterday and I had to just deaf I fell on the defensive and I said I needed to find it was pocketable and you know what they said to me.
Get pants with bigger pockets bigger pants.
It's interesting this has happened to you and I kind of wonder it has to do with the point that your phone is.
Comically different in size from your gigantic hands because that's what it is like I've said before the podcast I've never actually been in your physical presence Andrew so I can't really judge this is what you've told us where is I've been out and about with the iPhone 13 mini 12 mini before that.
People said what's that and I explained it was a mini that's actually a pretty good size particularly from women who thought it might fit into a clutch or purse or super tiny pocket even if they,
manage to find pants with pockets so is it the fact that it's a huge contrast with your.
Physical presence Andrew you're an imposing figure to him and iPhone mini is like an iPod nano in his hand I think that's probably I think.
If that maybe like the little clippy one even like it's no screen it's just the shuffle it just looks like he's carrying a shuffle.
That's it.
So can we just roll on to September October I just need this new I need new phone I need a badly.
Well I'm glad that you were able to construct in your mind a justification for getting a new phone outside of just I need a new phone so I appreciate the effort there.
Thank you. Have you tried doing the display size change? You know, when you go to the zoomed thing,
and it actually expands your keyboard and makes the keys larger, pushes it up. That actually works
quite well, I think, for people with oversized hands. But the screen is already so small,
I wouldn't be able to see where I'm typing. No, but it's perfect because you can actually
zoom in all the elements like the icons on the keyboard, but reduce the text size dynamically.
So you can keep the text size, but have the larger keycaps.
Martin Martin I think the point of this segment in the show is to just acknowledge that he's going to get a new phone were meant to agree with the scenario and move on I think.
But it's my job to be a contrarian.
That's true.
Okay.
Fair enough.
I don't want to do that because I can't reduce my size the size of my type because I've already got it real like about normal I think it's normal size default but I can't shrink it I'm an old man right we talked about this.
You choose the zoomed option and then you bring the text back to what it was.
You're asking a lot of my eyes.
That's all I feel like.
I feel like.
I'm just saying all I'm trying to do is help you up until September, October.
Go in there.
All right.
Choose the zoomed option and then reduce the text to what you currently have.
And that will see you through to September.
I'll give it a try but I'm not convinced.
I tried to give me more screen space on my iPad and everything was just too tiny.
So I'm not feeling good about it.
But we can try.
Thanks Martin. I just can't believe you use a phone for ants.
It's just amazing to me.
All I wanted Martin to say was like Andrew, just look forward to September, October and get that new phone.
I didn't say you couldn't do that.
I'm just trying to help you up until that point.
No, no, he's giving me solutions.
I don't want solutions.
I want enablement.
I thought you'd be all over solutions, Mr.
Lean Manufacturing and Business Tracking and Consultancy.
What are you, Mr.
Problem? Clearly.
Speaking of Mr.
Problem.
Yes this is going.
Media corner.
When you go to certain restaurants that's a problem. What do you order from a huge menu? How do you eat said food? I think Martin's got something on this topic that he wants to discuss.
I do in the first part of my answer is to order whatever is labeled special and not on the specials board but special something Nana look nice Segway I wanted to bring up a show for media.
I mean.
We can't give the trophy to every Segway here.
Some are better than others.
Jason, we are dealing with a very fragile co-host right now
who thought that my solution offering was challenging.
So I want to guide Andrew carefully and gently through this program.
Sorry, sorry. First place Segway. Good job.
It was fantastic. You get a participation ribbon and more.
Gold star.
Andrew's looking very heavy.
Anyway, Media Corner. So, Andrew, you were talking about restaurants. Natasha and I watched this show
on ABC iView, which is like, I suppose, the Australian equivalent of BBC iPlayer or something.
Jason, you couldn't watch it even with a VPN, is that right?
No, that is correct. That is correct. Yeah, it was not having it. It's like it knew
what I was doing. And I'm wondering if that's... Because it's pretty odd. If you're using like a
whatever VPN, like a standard one. I imagine they don't have that many blocks of IP addresses on
the exit side. So I'm wondering if they're starting to quote figure that out now and
like block that kind of thing. I'm not sure. But no, I had no luck getting to view it. But I have
viewed it since. So I did my homework. Fantastic. Because for the listeners,
Natasha and I watched this show called Chopsticks or Fork. And I thought this would be a great bit
bit of stimulus for a discussion on the podcast
and see what listeners think in our Discord or elsewhere.
For context, for anyone who hasn't seen it,
Chopsticks or Fork is this beautiful
kind of 15 minute per episode series
following a woman called Jennifer Wong
who goes around Australia
visiting nostalgic Chinese restaurants
in rural or kind of regional communities.
And the context kind of is that in your childhood,
at least in Australia, and maybe in the US,
we'll find out shortly,
there was that kind of bedrock Chinese restaurant
that you would go to
and they would have all these treats like fried ice cream
or honey chicken or sweet and sour, whatever,
things that probably never actually existed in China
but were designed to fit the Western palette.
And it's not just Chinese restaurants
that I would refer to,
like there are Vietnamese ones here in Wollongong,
all these other ones.
But I wanted to know, first of all, if both of you had a chance to watch that first episode, which is in Moree, New South Wales, and what you thought of the show.
And from there, did it remind you of anything in your own towns?
Andrew, maybe you first as the Australian.
I watched it and it was an absolute delight.
And I look forward to watching the next episodes.
And, yeah, there was Chinese restaurants like that were very big.
And I have memories of being a kid and going to places like that.
I still enjoy going to places like that.
And I sometimes feel guilty that all I really want to do
is order the honey chicken,
and I think I really should, and sweet and sour pork,
and I really should get something different,
but there's just something so comforting
about that food option.
It's like, it's hard to go past.
But yeah, even there was in Victoria Park,
there was the International Food Hall.
It was an old rundown place,
but it almost took it to another level
because it was kind of like an indoor outdoor setting.
So it sort of had pavers that you sat in,
but you're indoors.
It had a planter box in the middle.
So it seemed like you're outside, but there was a roof.
I don't know how it all worked,
but around the edge was you could choose any,
you could choose Chinese.
You could choose one or two different Chinese shops.
Which ones did you want?
And then they'd have a fish and chip shop
and a different, so it was a food hall
in the sense that it was kind of like
what you see in shopping centers now, I guess.
And yeah, that was another great memory.
And so the whole family could go
and they could choose whichever cuisine
they wanted to enjoy themselves.
That was a great option too.
But yeah, the classic Chinese restaurant, beautiful.
Love it.
- So if you had to say Andrew,
what is your favorite dish to order out?
And it doesn't have to be a Chinese restaurant,
any kind of Asian cuisine that's been ported over
to Australia, what's your go-to dish?
- Oh gee, it's really difficult to say.
'Cause I honestly do,
like I love those two classics that I mentioned.
I do also like the omelettes.
Omelettes are pretty good because it sounds easy,
but then the way they make them,
often they just have a nicer sort of tang.
So I do like an omelette,
but I don't know if I have a go-to.
I like to look at the menu and think,
what am I in the mood for?
Sizzling Sichuan beef or whatever it is.
That's another great one.
- Oh, I love hearing the sizzle come out of the kitchen.
Everyone turns like, "Oh, here we go."
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's like, and they always say,
"Please don't touch it."
- Yes.
- Don't touch it.
- They're thoughtful.
- Yeah.
But everybody looks, everybody looks
because they think it's for them.
And they're all just like, yeah.
And then there's that look of disappointment
as they walk past your table and you're like,
ah, damn it.
Okay, ours is next.
I swear ours is next.
It's like you ordered 30 seconds ago.
Why would that be yours?
- What about you, Jason?
- Yeah, so I did, I quite literally watched it
the 15 minutes before we got on this call to start recording.
It was a fun little show.
I obviously knew nothing about it.
You both were talking about it in the high message thread
and I was very confused as to what was going on.
And then I realized, okay, it's part of the show, got it.
Tried to go watch it, couldn't.
Then through certain means, I was able to get
a copy of said show so I could watch it.
Quick side question before I get to the show.
It's only 15 minutes.
Do they do like, 'cause generally like a TV show
is like a 30 minute kind of thing.
So is 15 minutes, is that a common thing for you all
in terms of like TV show length?
Or is this just sort of weird in that respect?
- It's not common on the majority of shows.
It's probably something that's happened more
since we've gone to whatever you kind of call this web TV,
'cause I don't really watch ABC anymore
over normal digital television.
I watch everything through iView
either on demand or live, right?
- Okay. - And I've seen more
of these come through.
I mean, ABC's had Media Watch for years,
which is like the media critiquing media.
And that's been 15 minutes for as long as I can remember.
So kind of, but kind of not.
- It's kind of like Apple TV Plus
or like Disney Plus or whatever,
It's like there is no time frame so they can make the episodes like as long as they need to be. Okay, that makes sense
Yeah, I feel like first of all, I think 15 minutes is like the right amount for this kind of show
Oh, yeah, because if it were 30 minutes, I'd be like you're just filling it to fill it
So I really thought that was nice. But let's see. What was I gonna say?
So the the the premise of the show I think is really fun
I I would imagine that at any point in any of these episodes
Judging just from the first one literally no one's ever gonna say chopsticks over fork
Places are just seems that way I could be wrong, but yeah throwing that out there
But I the first thing I noticed is that her sense of humor is like almost one step past
Where I am we're like, I love a good like pun or a stupid joke or something
But like some of them were just even a little bit
outside of what I
What?
Oh, got it.
Okay, so I thought that was pretty funny,
that that was, 'cause I imagine that's how most people
think of me if they deal with me in any kind of context,
where I will say something that I think is hilarious,
and they're just like, what?
So that was really great, I appreciated that.
It was also just mind-bending to hear this show
with only Australian accents.
- Right.
- It was, 'cause I, obviously it's going to be that,
like, yeah, but I just, I think it's partly
because I just, I was like rushing to get to,
like get in, get in, watch it before we go.
And so it just started and it was just like,
whoa, where am I?
I'm in like some other head space.
So that was interesting as well.
But I like, the show was great.
I definitely wanna see more of them.
I'm also intrigued at just this idea of,
it's not just Chinese restaurants,
but it's like specifically more like in the country
kind of ones, not in the city,
not in a downtown area of a big city
where I think that the two would be very,
potentially very different.
At least that's what I think of here,
where if I'm in Chinatown in San Francisco,
that kind of food is gonna be very different
than if I'm in like the middle of, I don't know,
Iowa or something.
It's just gonna be completely different.
It's gonna be much closer to, I think, the show.
So yeah, I think it was a really fun show
and I love the premise of like, so chopsticks or fork?
It's like just such a good little thing.
- Do you have a favorite dish?
- Good question.
I think all the classics,
I mean, I'm not gonna say no, obviously,
but I think probably my,
one of my favorite types of things would be like a dim sum
where it's just like a lot of little things
because I think no one, this is a secret to no one,
but if there's like a choice of like four things,
like the answer is yes.
Like I just, I want all of them.
- I don't like-- - Food, computers, whatever.
That's the policy. - Yes, yeah.
The answer is just flat yes.
So to have dim sum is great
'cause you sort of get like a little bit of everything.
And I just, I think that fits my kind of head,
whatever, very well.
- That's a good point.
And what you said about the difference
between regional and city or like rural in this case
throughout the series, it's pretty true.
And Wollongong is kind of strange, I think,
in the sense that it has both.
So it has enough of a cosmopolitan or metropolitan,
you know, here's the more authentic thing,
but then you do have some of these older restaurants
that have hung around that keep those nostalgic things.
And Andrew, were you about to ask me what my favorite was?
- I absolutely was, yes.
- Perfect.
So this actually reminded me of my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Moolingong, which
is Nam Restaurant.
It is absolutely delicious.
Same family has run it for years.
It totally matched up with this series by Jennifer Wong.
And they do so many delicious dishes, but the satay chicken there, the Vietnamese satay,
is absolutely perfect.
It's kind of, I think it's fair to say, at least mildly famous throughout the city.
comes with a little flame in the middle when they deliver it, I just inhale that thing. And if people
end up watching the first episode of this Chopstick or Fork series, they talk about the
deep fried ice cream. They do the deep fried ice cream. And when Natasha and I watched this, you
know, watch that first episode of the series, we went, we need to go and have some. So we went back
to NAMM, you know, Mac was with family for the evening. And at the end, we ordered it, came out,
We got the caramel sauce because that's what we wanted to match the kind of exterior.
And then I went up to the counter. Surprise, surprise. I asked about the process to see if
it matched up. And he was very enthusiastic about discussing it. He said, well, look,
yeah, it wasn't very normal to do this when we came to Australia, but it's the thing that everyone
does. And there's a quality difference in how people actually do the deep fried ice cream.
He said, if you get the dodgy stuff, they actually just kind of put like
bready stuff around it. It's actually like a kind of sandwich,
whereas you actually need to do a dedicated kind of cake crumbing.
And you can tell the difference. This beautiful ball of cold ice cream wrapped in this
dedicated dessert schnitzel exterior. It was perfect. So, this show made me so happy.
Can you imagine that Martin went up and had a conversation with the
The restaurateur. I actually thought he was going to go further and say that he,
the guy took him back and they had a whole one hour session and showed him how to
make it. And he made his own. And the next one that went out was from him.
Look, I don't want to misrepresent this too much because you know,
I do it with strangers. I know you're joking about it now, but we,
I've been going this since I was a kid. And you go up to the counter,
he's like, Oh, how's your mum? How's the family? That sort of thing. So yeah,
it's a real kind of community vibe.
It's not fair. Whenever,
whenever I go up to a guy at the restaurant and try and have a conversation,
all he wants to do is actually just take my rubbish. Yeah, fake handshakes. Let's see if
everyone gets that reference. That's a way back now. That was like a deep cut. That was like way
back. That's a way back. Yeah. Maybe even a one prime plus cut, I think. Oh, good boy. I think so.
Well, the only way to find out if you're not sure is A, download every episode from 00 to 080,
whatever this is and join one prime plus and download all 30 some odd of those and spend the
next week and a half finding the reference it's a great way to spend your time now the final
question for this segment is chopsticks or fork chopsticks chopsticks chopsticks wow look at how
authentic we are three for three this is an episode that i think is is rolled gold throughout
It's going to be very difficult to trim anything down right. I'm expecting that this will run long and I think I think listeners are okay with that. I think occasionally they're like 45 is nice but I want a little bit more hemispheric views.
Well we can deliver a little bit more hemispheric views because we got an email.
We did so we always talk about reviews and emails and discords.
I don't think anyone's actually ever emailed us ever. I could be wrong about that, but I do believe
that our email inbox is pretty infested with cobwebs at this point. So I'd be amazed if an
email could come in. Or unbelievable AI solutions to streamline our editing process. We're always
getting lots of very helpful approaches about that. Oh, that's true. That's true. We do get
lots of advice. Also guests, people that would be great guests. Yeah, new authors who just fit
right in line with everything that we're talking about.
They've listened to our show and can't believe how amazing it is and how well they think that'd fit.
It's just, it's such a good fit. They say, they go, "Oh, you know what, Type 45,
we got an interview for you." So outside of those emails, which are actually garbage,
we got an actual email from somebody. And it was great because it was about the,
I think it was the most recent episode about the, we'll just call it the egg situation
I don't want to spoil in case anybody's a little behind but there was some egg controversy.
Possibly I'm most I think I'm most controversial show I've had feedback in real life on that.
Oh yeah oh I'm getting yeah.
I did that very deliberately by the way I knew it would divide people so.
Yeah the whole chicken liquid as a concept is it's taken off.
Yeah, it's it's quite the thing. So make sure everybody go back and listen to that. I believe that was episode 80
But yeah, we got an email. So I want to encourage everyone you can email us at any time directly or through the website
There's a little form. I think this one came through the form. I believe
Yeah, that was really all I wanted to mention. I don't know if you had more on that Andrew
I just want to say thank you for the email and we appreciate any at all feedback whether it's just a comment about something
we talked about or
Something he did something loved whatever will take it all and we replied this anything of thing outside.
Yeah we're going to the bar fight always that's just customer service.
I just want to throw my reply out verbally to the writer known simply as V.
Thank you for offering a genuine solution to the egg problem and dealing with the yellow within or as I like to call it uncooked chicken liquid.
You went there again.
Will be getting more emails now used to be a clean show now we are now we have explicit leave the out and it's a very clean shirt that's all I can say.
You know I want to hear to close this episode I want to hear Jason say hemispheric views on demand in his coolest kind of one prime plus cross cinema trailer from the 90s voice.
So close us out with see you next time for hemispheric views on demand.
Okay, here we go.
Thank you all for listening and we'll see you again on hemispheric views on demand.
That was good and you can just imagine music fading out.
I wish I had an American accent. Do you?
No you don't. Totally. So cool.
Nah. What's your equivalent of Opal over there
Opel.
Opel?
Like the car that you tap on transport, like Nike in Victoria.
Oh, oh, oh, Smart Rider.
Okay, Jason, can you exclaim really loudly in your biggest tourist voice,
"Excuse me, sir, where's the Smart Rider machine?"
What?
What I said.
"Excuse me, sir, where's the closest Smart Rider machine?"
Go more Texan. Do it again. You're in Texas.
I'm not in Texas.
Texas where you are in Texas.
Go and do it now.
Do it now.
You've come to Australia.
You're from Texas and you're asking for the smart riding machine.
Come on Jason.
All he can do is like shitty cowboy.
That's fine.
That's fine.
That's what he wants.
He wants like howdy partner.
Where's the where do you find that there smart rider?
We need more volume.
More volume.
Because you're Texan.
No, because we're still recording.
You're going to use this at some point.
Come on what Martin is trying to say what he's trying to say is that American accent sound cool until they're placed in an Australian environment where Australians are talking a respectable volume for whenever and then some American comes out obnoxiously asking for something.
How is it in the USA we have smart rise by the gate.
And why are you not putting them by the gate?
How could we be louder than you?
On public transport here, yes.
You all are so loud.
All I'm trying to illustrate, the American accents are diverse and beautiful and very interesting,
but if Andrew wants to have genuine handshakes at kebab shops, I don't think that would help him, is what I'm saying.
Excuse me, where's the smart rider?
Smart rider!
Anyway, I think I've made my point. Would you like to count us down?
Counting down in 3, 2, 1, stop.
