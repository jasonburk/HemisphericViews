It's gonna be a good one, I think, because it's gonna be a tight 30.
I'm calling it right now, tight 30.
That's what we're calling this one, end of the year tight 30.
We have to get an average down.
[Music]
I'm going to then throw to the designer of the notes for episode 074, Martin Feld.
When you say designer, do you mean Feldfoot of the notes?
I was being kind with designer, but whatever you want to call it.
Well, yeah, I was a bit bossy this time.
You run a tight ship, Martin. That has to be said.
Tight ship, tight 30.
I try my best. Well, I just thought, you know, we have so many corners and stuff.
we'll revisit some regular ones,
but with a bit of a, what's been nice in 2022?
What are some things that you've done or bought or taken?
Let's have a bit of reflection.
And I thought the first corner we could do,
which is great for an audio only medium,
is photography corner.
- Definitely.
- But before we get into the particular show and tell aspect,
I wanted to know from you, Jason,
besides your iPhone, which you obviously really enjoy,
What are you really enjoying in the camera world?
Or what do you use the most to fill up your
Berkdot photos and Glass account?
- Good, thank you for that prompt.
Yeah, the iPhone obviously is there.
It is the lowest common denominator camera
where it just is with you.
So you're going to use it because it's with you.
So it's great.
Other than that, I generally roll
with two different cameras.
So the Sony line is where I have,
So long ago, you know, keeping with the tight 30,
we're gonna go quick here.
Long ago, Nikon all the way.
And then at some point switched to Sony.
I found their stuff to be a little bit more to my liking,
going from DSLR to mirrorless.
So I'm still with the Sony camp, Sony A7 IV.
And then the other half of my photography is the Leica Q2.
And you're like, why do you have two cameras?
that seems really stupid.
Well, it is sort of stupid, that's true,
but there is sort of a reason for it.
The Q2 is a fixed lens camera,
so it is stuck with what is on there,
that is all you get, which is phenomenal.
I tend to say that the Leica Q2 is like,
you bought a lens and got a free camera
'cause the lens is absolutely crisp and amazing,
but I did buy the Sony so that I could have
a little bit more flexibility
in terms of interchangeable lenses.
So that is the reason for both.
And generally, if I'm gonna just go out
not knowing what's coming up, it'll be the a7,
just because it has a little more versatility.
And to be perfectly honest,
I'm a little less afraid of something happening to it
versus the Leica Q2 where I'm like,
ah, if anything happens to it, I will cry.
But the Leica Q2 is generally when I will take out
when I wanna be like very purposeful.
I'm going out to just do photography.
I wanna be disconnected
and just have the constraint of single lens,
one camera, nothing else,
and like be there for that moment.
So that is the quick version of photography for me.
- Now that's a great rundown.
And if you had to choose which of those two cameras
you actually prefer, which one's better?
- Ooh, if I had to, if you said all cameras,
you get to carry one going forward,
I would probably go,
oh man, that's tough.
I would probably go with the Q2, honestly,
because I just feel like what's coming out of that
is so what I love to see.
I almost never have to do anything
to the images that come out of that camera.
Versus the Sony, I generally would do
a little bit more to it.
And it's just more fiddly,
'cause now it's like, oh, I'm fixing lenses,
I'm changing lenses, I'm doing settings.
I feel like the Q2 is just more of a pure photography form for me.
Perfect.
And Andrew, I don't want to leave you out of this.
Do you have anything to add to photography corner?
No.
Because I know you said that a while ago you were really into big cameras, but have you
strayed from that?
Yeah, I got no time for any of that anymore.
It's just an iPhone 13 mini.
Occasional finger in it.
That's another reason I've got to upgrade to a bigger phone.
Because when I hold it, my finger always covers the lens.
It's that big basketball hand.
My hand's too big for a mini.
MBL pocket hand cast.
- Well, this is a nice bit of context here
because the show and tell aspect,
I thought we could share our top three
or three favorite photos with each other
that we've taken this year.
Non-family photos, 'cause that's a different story.
Just stuff that you thought was interesting
or maybe showed off the camera that you were using.
And I can see, I think maybe Jason or Andrew,
which one of you prompted actually including
the number of photos and videos we took this year?
That's interesting.
- Yeah, I just looked at it 'cause I was looking in photos
and I noticed that it was actually remarkably less
than in past years.
So I just thought it was curious what your numbers were.
I don't think high or low means anything particularly,
but it was just interesting given that
because we have our phones with us all the time
and that's one of our main cameras,
like the number is usually pretty high.
So I was just kind of curious what you all had
for photos and videos for 2022.
I'll throw out numbers and then maybe you both can put yours
there just as context I had 2,178 photos and 120 videos for 2022. 1,512 photos, 140 videos.
Wow, a lot of video. I should preface this that there's a good number of work photos that have
ended up in my library from the stuff that I do, although it is the minority, let's just say it's a
Few hundred in there, but I've got five thousand five hundred and forty four photos and eight hundred and eighty five videos Wow
Somebody had a small Mac this year
Yeah, it's just varying angles of the same child
Here he is walking on a driveway here he is slightly further down the driveway eating a mushroom. Yeah
Man, that's a lot of photos this year is one of the years I went through and I was like trying to be quite
Rigid about if I took three photos of the same subject actually going back and choosing one and deleting the others
Which is not something I'm always
Conscientious about but I have been this year. It's hard to do. Yeah, it's hard to be diligent about that
Yeah, so that's reduced my numbers a little bit a few less of those burst mode photos
So how do we want to deal with these three three photo pics? So we just go round Robbiny
Do we just put them in the show notes? How do we want to do this?
I reckon yeah
We link them in the show notes so listeners can see and maybe we'll just go in the order that we have in our own notes
here so Jason you describe what you like about your three photos then Andrew then I'll finish and
People can load them up if they like and share what they think on discord or elsewhere tight 30 Jason tight 30
Tight 30. Here we go tight 30
I'm going to do GPT-3 for all of them.
So in this first photo, we have a bird bath that I found, I don't remember where, but
what I liked about it was that it was full of water, but the water is completely blown
out so it is just completely white and gives this weird feeling of like what is in there.
So I loved that one.
I think that one was probably one of my top ones that I liked of the year for sure.
The second one was a little patch of moss, I think it's moss, moss grass, something,
growing in between bricks.
I see it to be in the shape of a heart.
It's kind of a triangle, but I'm going to say that it's a shape of a heart and it was
just a nice, like bright green heart in the middle of this like kind of just sad brick
laying stuff on the ground.
So I really liked that one.
And then the third one I think actually came from one of the, we did a micro.blog photo
challenge this year.
I forget what month it was now.
I'd have to go back and look, but I tend to try to do more like weird creative stuff for
those ones.
So this one is actually, I call it square moon and it is a, it's actually a light panel.
That's sort of like a, a squared off, uh, squared off.
Sorry.
What is this called like a squircle where it's like a round wreck kind of thing
It's a light panel and then there's a little toy spaceman on it, which is completely black against a completely white
Light and then completely back black background
So it's just sort of this weird like spaceman floating in front of a square moon thing, which I I really enjoyed
So that was my three photos that I picked out of
- They're pretty cool.
I think what listeners will see
when they look at these photos
is you can kind of see a different theme
or preference or way of photography across each of us.
And looking at yours, Jason,
do you like tight subjects or like a focal point?
You like looking at one thing?
- I love that.
And I also love edge tension.
So I love placing something almost to the edge touching,
but just not touching,
just to give you that bit of like,
anxiety of like, why is it either out of the frame or not?
And it's like so close to the edge.
I love that line at the bottom of the, like between the pavers and that mossy
photo. Yeah, I can. It's just, yeah. It's just like, I can be nervous.
Most people probably would have cropped up a little bit to get rid of that,
but I just love that it gives you that like, Oh, why is it like that?
I love that.
That's really cool. I'm impressed by the contrast on the one with the spaceman.
Yeah. That's very catchy. Uh, who's, uh, let's see, is it basketball next?
Basketball's next.
- Basketball's next.
- All right, my first one is,
this was also a micro.blogfoto challenge photo, I think.
And I know Martin said no family,
but I figured this was significantly de-identified
that it could pass.
It's just a shadow of one of my boys lifting his leg up,
but it kind of, I like it 'cause the pants are kind of baggy
and it gives, he's doing sort of a karate kick
and it gives this bizarre kind of, yeah, karate image.
I find it just messes with my mind a little bit.
'Cause the angles are a bit wonky
'cause it's a silhouette on a floor.
And yeah, I just think it's fun and kind of a bit odd.
So I like that one.
The second one, I think is probably technically
like the best photo I took all year.
And it's also a memory of when we're on holiday
in Ningaloo Reef.
You may remember the two RGAs.
- Very well.
- Yeah.
I think was it I forgot the name of the creek really creek I was really great I might be wrong actually it's creek anyway and it's so short just I just love the contrast between you have the water level then you have the hard rock and then you got this cloud formation it just perfectly edged across it.
I'm very happy with that one it's gorgeous the last one was as another memory of mine was when I did the basketball tournament in Darwin.
And it kind of is nice for me because it was when I was just able to wander down and sit court side, which is not something you can generally do.
You know, I was catching balls as I was flying out of court and everything.
And this is just a moment of where there's a timeout called.
Ball is placed, ready to be picked up back into play.
You got the referees.
And I just like all the angle compositions.
You can kind of get everything that you need to know.
You see the hoop, see the ball, see the court and the placement that I was sitting to take that photo as a nice memory.
They're such on the floor.
Yeah.
I love the contrast of the shadow kickboxer.
I love the fact that on the second one, you can draw a line directly down the middle and it's just a mirror reflection.
And the third one, my favorite part is that they placed the basketball almost as if it were for the photo.
Yeah, with the logo.
The, the, the logo is perfectly placed.
It's like, it could have been like weird and just sideways and the lines were going all weird, but it was like they placed it there.
This feels like a staged photo.
Yeah.
Like you were like, okay, you two people go over there, pretend like you're bickering about something,
team, pretend like you're doing team stuff, and then make sure the ball is perfectly placed.
I was going to ask if you were sitting there, Andrew, and then you just leapt up and ran over
and said, guys, can you just stand there? And I just put the ball here and everyone stays still.
And then you ran back and they're like, okay, game can start now.
No, just happenstance, but a happy accident. Yeah, I'm really pleased with it.
Nice all around.
Thank you.
Very good. And that contrast one we can call what canyons can jump. Is that the title of that photo?
Yes. That sounds good.
I think so.
So Martin, you've got a colour theme going on in yours.
Yeah, I like blue.
Also, I will say maybe the theme of 2022 was that we could actually see blue sky,
because last summer, like we have had so much rain around here from La Nina for the last,
I don't know how long, that the moment the clouds parted and I could see the sky,
I think that's just where I kept looking. So that's the result this year.
Yeah, so the first one, which is this kind of warped shape reaching into the sky,
I just thought that was a cool look. It's actually this kind of warped steel sculpture. It's one of
a few of them out the front of the visitor centre where I work in Port Kemblet within
the city of Wollongong. And yeah, like I said, the sky's just been gorgeous. And I went, oh,
I liked the kind of contrast of the reddy brown
against the sky, so that's a favorite.
The next one I've enjoyed because people kind of
were baffled about how I got that photo with the plane.
They thought, were you leaning out of one?
Were you safe?
What's going on?
It's actually mounted on this big pole
outside the Aviation Museum, south of Wollongong.
And if you position it just right,
it looks like you're basically flying.
So that was another favorite.
And the last one with the helicopter,
I just happened to be completely underneath it.
And this was during the UCI bike event in Mulingong,
the big international cycling event.
And they had all these different broadcasters
and helicopters and photographers around.
So that was just some good positioning.
So yeah, I like blue.
- Yeah, I like that last one with the helicopter.
I like the capture of the blades.
You see the rotors just with a slight bit of motion blur,
but it's been able to capture them as independent blades.
And then just the solid power lines or whatever they are next to it.
Correct.
At first I was like, Oh, why the power lines in there?
And then the more I look at it, I'm like, I like those power lines being there.
I love those power lines.
Love it.
I love everything about those lines being there and that they're not
perfectly perpendicular to like the rest of the, Oh, it's great.
That, that annoys me actually.
I wish, I wish that just pivot that.
Can we get that line straight?
That gets you thinking about it. That's what I love about it. It just makes you like dive in deeper.
Like what the hell? What were they? Did they do that on purpose? Why do they hate me? Like, that's what I love about it.
This is perfect. 74 episodes and I've now worked out how to really please Jason and piss off Andrew with the same thing.
So I might just start sending an email with something completely not justified or lined up or a picture that's a bit warped.
Remember, I'm this. I chose the square window in play school.
It's true.
It all just adds up.
They are good, man.
Well that, I think that was great.
Photography corner for 2022.
Fantastic.
Nice.
Not to mention there's a photos channel in Discord.
People want to share it.
Yep.
Feel free to share your top two, three, whatever photos in the Discord.
Yeah.
That'd be great.
Love to see it.
[Music]
Media Corner.
All right, Morfeld Direction. What's the most interesting movie that you saw in 2022?
And I'm going to go against the order of the notes here,
because Jason went first the last time, and say, Andrew, you first.
I had to go back through my letterbox D letterbox list to figure out what I had watched this year and I thought.
You had that wonderful review of the Matrix revolutions is that.
Yes I am so close it would have if I if it is the best movie I watched in 2022 maybe but you had said what's the most interesting movie so it didn't quite win what did win was coda.
the Apple TV+ show about the girl who can sing,
who is a member of a deaf family,
and they live in their fishing village
and the lifestyle of fishing,
and she has this totally different opportunity
put before her.
I found it really, and it was interesting for me
because it addressed this different family dynamic
that we don't usually see,
and I found it really,
I was just captivated by that movie throughout.
I thought it was a really enjoyable watch.
It tugged the heartstrings at the right times,
had really good performances,
but overall, like Martin said,
I just found it really interesting
'cause it's a world that I know nothing about.
So Koda.
- Yeah, there's a scene in that movie,
I don't wanna spoil it for people entirely,
but I had never really,
I mean, I've thought about the experience of people
with hearing impairments or deafness,
but there's that scene
where they're just sitting in the concert,
just sitting there 'cause they can't hear anything.
It's like wow, that's yes, just vibrations and sort of pick it up that way and that kind of thing
Yeah, really really good show. So that's mine. Good choice. Who's next? I'm waiting for the dictator to to make a selection
Well, I'll go next so Jason can have the last word
How about that because I all I see is feet in the third position here
So I mean we know that I won't have the last word, but they appreciate it
Now I'm hesitant to say anything because then I might end up with the last word. That's damn it
Right, well, like Andrew was saying, I don't know if it's the best, but I thought it was the most interesting because we saw a few cool movies this year.
But the one that comes to mind is the one that we saw at the movies most recently, and that was The Menu.
Have either of you heard of this?
No, I've not.
Great movie, amusing, dark, disturbing.
It won't leave your brain.
It's basically a satire of modern wanky food culture.
- Yeah.
- But the premise isn't, because I don't want to ruin it
because it does kind of go south.
And when I say south, I don't mean bad as a movie,
but kind of terrifying pretty quickly.
The idea is that there's this super exclusive culinary
experience on this island that all of these people
have signed up for and paid big bucks to go and attend.
And you follow all these people who go out on the boat,
they meet the chef and all these dedicated people
in the kitchen.
And they've all kind of got their own little story
or something that's bothering them
or distracting them from the experience.
And it's all completely over the top and extravagant
as this culinary experience on the island.
But you kind of feel that something's not quite right
about the kitchen and the dining room where they all are.
And they're not really invested or paying attention
to what's going on around them.
And it slowly starts to unravel
and they understand that what they were there for
is not what they expected.
So it's--
- Cannibals.
Got it.
That's a theory, could be cannibals.
But yeah, we just thought it was really, really interesting.
If you've ever been to a fancy restaurant
and felt it was a bit over the top, you'll see it there.
You'll see the attitude of customers.
You'll see the attitude of the chefs,
kind of ungratefulness.
It's just a great mirror up to society
and how much it takes things for granted.
So I'd recommend the menu,
but be aware it might make you throw up your lunch at parts.
- So you said it was amusing,
but would it be better off to say it was amuse-bouche?
- Oh, boy. - You could say that.
- Absolutely. - Wow.
Good job, end of the year special, love it.
- Still got it.
Good job.
- Still got it.
For all these decades of this show, you still got it.
I love it.
- What have you got?
- Your turn, Jason.
- I guess that leaves me.
I was skimming the notes and I saw movie and 2022.
So I didn't really pick up on the keyword
there being interesting.
So I'll preface with that. I picked Bullet Train, which arguably is interesting.
But I mostly just picked it because I thought it was really fun.
Yeah, that's what I'm bringing to the table today.
You guys brought deep, heartfelt movies and I brought Bullet Train.
In your defense, I almost chose Top Gun Maverick until I realized it was interesting.
And yeah, the best movie for me would have been Top Gun Maverick, so don't feel bad.
So one thing that came out of this though is I realized that I don't actually track
in any way what movies I've seen.
And that means that two weeks after I watched it, I don't really remember.
So I might actually start keeping a little tally of films that I have seen just so that
I can kind of reflect.
And when this comes up again in 12 months, I will not only have an interesting movie
to pick, I will have remembered it as well.
So if nothing else, this has served me as guidance for the future.
I'm kind of surprised that it wasn't on your wiki already, but that's fine.
Let's bring up in feature request/knowledge management corner.
That's a corner now?
Yeah, of course.
Micro.blog has its book tracking feature, which is really good.
It's not trying, it doesn't try and do too much.
It's just a little list that you can curate.
I would love to see that replicated for movies on that service because I'm using Letterboxd
for that purpose.
And so I write and I try and log of you know when I watched it and
It and basically it then populates to my micro blog feed and so that would be you know
But if it was just built into micro blog, that would be brilliant. Hmm get rid of that service. I don't pay for it
I'm just a cheapskate. But yeah, that's the otherwise
I'm the same as you Jason have no idea of what I watched when I watched well
I'm gonna change all that for next time. So I will have something interesting next time
[Music]
Tight 30. Tight 30. Here we go. Moving on to point number three in the tight 30 list.
What do you got Martin?
Share your three favorite tech products or services that you tried or purchased in 2022.
Now you already sent me a message earlier Jason saying, does the foot allow more?
I was like, yeah, whatever. Just because you know the answer is actually no.
I'm not that much of a strict person. Seriously.
As long as you follow the instructions.
As long as you don't get out of line.
I'm very accommodating.
Alright, so the top three, I'm going to go through quickly.
First one was the iPad Mini.
Just a great all-round, not pocketable device, but the kind of essence of what I think an iPad should be.
I probably use my iPad Pro more, practically, because that's what I edit this show on when it's my turn and other podcasts that I do.
That's really the podcast machine.
But it's something to sit back, read something,
browse the web, chat on Discord,
really actually edit photos.
It's the one I use for editing photos the most
'cause it's just really nice to sit there
and cross things over from another device.
It's just a wonderful thing and I'm glad that it exists.
With photos as the segue,
number two would be the Olympus camera
that I've carried on about over and over again.
And specifically the 40 to 150 millimeter telephoto lens
that I got with it.
I was using it.
- Can we get a quick readout of the model number again?
'Cause I just like when you read out the model number.
- For Olympus.
- Yeah.
- It's the OMD EM10.
Is that because you're actually interested or 'cause you?
- No, I just like when you have to fully read out
Olympus OM-D space E-M10.
- Just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?
Particularly when you highlight the dashes, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks for that.
Yeah, 'cause I almost forgot which model I was using.
So I'm glad you brought that up.
- I'm here for you.
- Exactly, thank you.
I think this is an all-round great camera.
The telephoto was fantastic.
I was using it this morning at Symbio Wildlife Park
while Mac was hugging kangaroos, which was good fun.
There's a photo of micro dot blogger.
- I didn't know you were allowed to do that.
- Oh, you'd be very placid.
Unless it's one of the big red ones,
they'll probably kick you in the face.
You'll have to get cosmetic surgery or something.
- Don't worry, little gray is fine.
- Yeah, little gray is fine.
Yeah, that's just a wonderful camera.
Used a lot for family and work.
And yeah, just a total revelation
after my earlier larger DSLR, which I loved,
but this is just more modern, I suppose.
And to finish off number three,
probably the most controversial product
of the year in Apple circles,
I will say it is the studio display.
So much whinging this year for nothing.
Yes, it's expensive.
If you can get it, great.
If not, no big deal.
Lots of other displays out there that are nice.
In terms of what I wanted,
I had never had an Apple branded display before
and I wanted something that had the camera
and the speakers in built with decent height adjustment.
It ticks every single box.
And you know what?
I'm looking at myself in this camera right now.
I can see all my facial features.
I appear generally sharp.
I don't think I look like some sort of
warped beast from another world.
I think the world needs to calm down.
So I'm grateful that this now exists
after years of no displays.
- It's as if tech internet were full of shit
most of the time.
I was going to ask you, how do you live with yourself having to use that camera day in, day out, Martin?
Because it's so disastrous, right?
It's like...
I'm...
It was just...
It's fine.
It's fine.
Exactly.
I can tell the difference between using something like this and the continuity camera thing
with the phone, right?
There's an obvious difference.
But a lot of the stuff that we saw online, I feel, is exacerbated by the fact that it's
being compressed through something like Zoom or uploaded to Twitter.
So something that wasn't 100% has been reduced again.
And then people are judging.
It's just a weird comparison to make.
And also there are bigger problems such as war in Ukraine.
And we can probably move on with our lives.
Martin, I need my YouTube selfie video in high definition 4K so I can give my opinions
on the latest Apple tech.
Good emphasis.
Well, and the people who are saying that probably have at least eight other cameras they could
use mounted.
Exactly.
If you're making YouTube videos, whatever, invest in something different.
Like we invest in my 30. Sorry. Right. Tight, tight 30, 30.
Who's turns that man.
You two can fight over it. I'm having a sip of water. Jason, you go.
Go ahead. Okay. I'll go. Um, so you already mentioned I've had many,
I will second that as one of my choices.
It's the most used iPad I've ever had ever. And it's fantastic. I love it.
It's great. Next would be the Q, what is it? Keychron Q1 keyboard. I don't think I have ever
had more joy typing than on this keyboard. 100 out of 10. Love it. And then I'll switch a little
bit to software. I am recently, very recently become a second time now convert to Readwise
and Readwise Reader. I used Readwise in the past, I didn't get it, I was confused,
I didn't understand why I needed it, then I threw it away, I have it again now and I love it.
And Readwise Reader is like crushing every single box I have for what I want from a service like
that. I've never gone through so many things that I've wanted to read more than with Reader.
And then the final one I'll throw in is a combo of omglol/webgloll.
Webloggloll.
Something to that.
If we're still workshopping the name.
That's a new thread.
I migrated everything that is my website to weblog.loll.
I don't recommend anybody do that right now because it's very early days.
But bleeding edge.
What the hell?
Why not do it?
And then everything OMG is just like so much fun. I love it. Everything that's built over there is
phenomenal. I have it. It's I call it I jokingly call it and Adam probably hates this, but I call
it OMG dot AOL because I think of that OMG LOL as like my AOL where just all of my crap is within
that like little walled garden and I absolutely love it and would never want to leave. So that
That is my omg.aol.
And I know we're only allowed three,
but I'm gonna throw in the last one.
That is the Apple Watch Ultra.
I love it.
It's the best Apple Watch ever made.
End of story.
Thank you very much.
Type 30.
- All right.
I wanna make it clear that this year
I didn't buy a single hardware item.
- Good for you.
- It was significant enough to make it
to my depreciation spreadsheet.
- Can we get a reminder of what that break,
that like cutoff is?
Is there a hard line?
- There's not a hard line.
- Is it a little wiggly?
Okay.
- Like if you bought new cutlery, that's pretty expensive.
Is that going to depreciation spreadsheet?
No, cause depreciation is just for electronics. Right. But, um, it's so already we're,
we're, we're carving things out. Yeah.
And it's got to be something that I feel is like not an instant asset write-off,
but more something that is a, not, you know,
like a plant and equipment that's going to depreciate over a number of years.
Okay. So you probably.
Plant equipment. Do you have a lot of plant equipment at your house?
That doesn't go on the spreadsheets. It's only electronics. Okay. Um, okay.
So that's probably about 400 bucks.
400 bucks is usually the cutoff.
- Okay.
- So I can buy anything.
- Printing presses.
- But in the grand scheme of things,
it really sounds like it's more when you feel like it.
- Well, yeah.
- Seems like, yeah, okay.
- So aluminium smelters.
- I've done some software.
So I've got software only on my list
and it's gonna be quick.
So I've got LogSeek, Obsidian,
the, you know, the, uh, the Aldi obsidian, perhaps you would say.
If I were going to give you 15 seconds to say why log sec is better than obsidian
or, or not better, but why did you pick that since they seem, they seem very
similar.
So I think maybe people would be curious.
Um, I like writing in outlines and it's an outliner.
Got it.
Okay.
Basically it's otherwise the same read wise reader for all the same reasons.
There's still a few rough edges on it, but it is a brilliant reader.
And likewise, I've already, I had a subscription last time around, it expired.
I'm going to have to buy it again now.
And my last one, unsurprisingly, OMG.lol.
Just so cool.
So cool.
Adam's done an amazing job.
I don't know how he finds the time, the motivation, the ability to do all that he
does with that service.
It's quite incredible.
I'm not using it at all because I started off with a weblog and I was like, what am
I doing?
I'm comfortable with micro.blog.
Don't rock this boat.
It's not a knock on the weblog service.
It's just, I need to, I need to know when I don't need something.
So, but it's awesome.
Fair.
I just think, I just want to say, look, you know how everybody says, Oh, you get a
podcast so you can justify buying all the stuff so you can talk about it.
My proof is in the pudding.
I didn't buy anything.
It's true.
Yeah.
Okay.
Nice Christmas joke there, Andrew.
Thank you.
There's still time to buy one prime plus though for your holiday needs.
Oh yes.
Last-minute gift. I mean that's like nothing says I love you during the holidays like a $2 subscription to
OnePrimePlus.com. Exactly. Good segue there because we have a new OnePrimePlus subscriber, Francine F.
Welcome Francine. Hello Francine. Wow, Francine F. Thank you. Claps all around. Thank you for joining
OnePrimePlus.com
She clearly knows it's in the long game. That's that's why you join. You don't join if you don't know it's a long game. No.
No, no, you don't you're not looking for for quick returns here. This is this isn't crypto
No, it isn't probably a good thing. I think it's for the best that nothing we do is related to crypto
So one prime plus those NFTs though get you get yourself in the Hemisphere Museum at NFT selling fast. No, you know, what's better than that?
One prime plus comm we will send you a physical sticker
that has actual legitimate value versus an NFT,
which is complete BS.
So oneprimeplus.com.
(upbeat music)
- There is one more thing to this show,
which has nothing to do with the year specifically.
And I thought it'd be fun if we all mentioned
a quirky or embarrassing habit that we have.
Now, it might be something that you've been aware
of your whole life.
It could be something that's more recent.
Maybe you never noticed it and a partner or family member
or a colleague pointed it out.
I just thought it would be interesting to say.
Now, shall I kick us off or?
- I just wanna say,
I noticed that you two left your show notes blank here.
I gave a really half-hearted response
and you two have left your notes blank.
So I am hoping for real good stuff from you two.
- Well, actually Andrew, having read yours,
I went, yeah, I do that too.
(both laughing)
I feel exactly the same.
Actually just say what it is because it's already there and I can relate to it.
It's stupid right? Quirky embarrassing habit.
I can't leave any iOS or Apple TV device on an app when it's going into standby mode or anything.
If I finish using it I have to go back to springboard whether that is on the phone or even on Apple TV.
Like I can't leave it.
Definitely can't leave it halfway through a video and just drop it out.
No.
But and I really don't like just dropping out to the Amazon Prime or Stan.
I like to get back to springboard, back to the start every time.
And I know I'm probably costing myself efficiency, but I have sympathy for the machine.
I have two questions.
Two questions.
And they're very quick.
Number one, does this also apply, although it's a different kind of layout or interface to the Mac?
What do you do there when you walk away, putting it to sleep or in shutdown?
I do tend to, like, if I've got work things open, I definitely quit them because I don't want to be confronted by work garbage later.
I will often, and I do quit fairly regularly my apps.
I will also tend to at least close windows.
My second question is, let's say someone else has been using the Apple TV and you're in the room and they just turn it all off having left an app open.
Do you lecture them or resurrect the whole setup to then do it the way that you want?
I don't bother lecturing because with kids in the house, it's just not worth it. But what I
will sometimes do is just grab that little Apple remote and just hit the hit the little TV button
a few times. So I just know. Yeah, I know it's I know it's back. It's good. I knew there'd be
a process. Jason, you do this as well. Not with the Apple TV, surprisingly.
You just walk away, just in the moment, you don't care.
I just hold the power button until it shuts everything down and then I leave.
So you've got bullet train playing halfway through and you just walk away, you just turn it off.
Just shut it down.
Just shut it down.
No, I would never leave halfway through a movie.
No, no, if there's a show on, it'll be back to beginning so that I can resume.
Unless there is in a very big extenuating circumstance, I will never like half watch a
movie. I can't do a partial movie. It's either we're watching this or we're not. There is no,
I've seen half of it. It's like, no, sorry. It's funny you say that. Sorry, quick mention.
Since my life, Natasha's too, has been carved up by the nap times of Mac. If I ever want to
watch a movie by myself, which is very rare, like it doesn't happen very much, it does happen in
in pieces so I bought the entire 007 collection for a discounted price on the Apple TV store
because I have seen a lot of them like most of them but not all of them.
I thought I'm going to gradually go in order so it's amazing what your life can be like
when you can only watch Sean Connery for up to 12 minutes at a time.
You're just doing like one scene at a time.
Like oh this is scene 17 of From Russia with Love.
I'm still following what's happening.
I know what you mean, like I think movie beginning to end.
That's how it works.
- All right, come on enough procrastinating.
Type 30, what's your habit?
- All right, I'll go.
- Type 30.
- I worked this out recently and it's actually a problem
that I've been aware of for years,
but it kind of clicked how it's been operating.
Now we're gonna do some translations
for different hemispheres here.
Andrew, you and I would just say the loo or public toilet.
Right, I'm off to the loo,
you're at a shopping center or something,
everyone knows what that means.
For other people around the world, maybe it's the water closet, WC, restroom, washroom.
I don't know.
Does toilet offend Americans, Jason?
Bathroom.
But see, that's the thing.
There's no bath in there.
So I've always felt a bit weird about saying that.
But if you're translating, you got to be a collaborator to everyone.
Oh, I know.
It's just whenever Americans say I'm off to the bathroom, like, you have a wonderful,
relaxing time in there.
You don't know that we're not taking a bath in there.
What, in a toilet?
You don't know.
This is our private time.
We don't have to answer to you.
- Cool, I'm glad we covered that.
(laughing)
Yeah, so what I worked out is that,
you know when you go to a shopping center or a mall
and there'll be a bathroom/restroom/toilet
for men's, women's, unisex, people with disabilities,
and it's always behind that kind of wall
where you have to go down a bit of a hall or it splits off.
It's never like right open to the walkway.
- Yep, yep.
- So I'll follow it, find the male toilet
or whatever it is that I have to use and go in there.
And whenever I leave, I always feel somewhat disoriented.
I don't know about you.
It's like, because they make you weave.
And I noticed that I always turn the wrong direction
when I leave the restroom.
Every time.
- It's like being in the severance office
whenever you wanna go to the bathroom.
You're like, how did I get in here?
How do I get out?
- Exactly. - Where's my key card?
- How the hell do I get out?
And then I realized,
I think I have an automatic bias to turn right.
And like 80% of the time it's wrong.
And I go, what is wrong with me?
So even times that I've gone today,
I am following this route and this is where I'm going.
This is how I'm gonna turn out.
I turn right and it's like,
"Nope, there's mops there."
And I'm wrong. - It's not uncommon
that you always think you're right, Martin.
- That's a good place to leave that one.
- No, it's not.
You have segued into business corner.
- Oh, go for it.
- It's a real, he secretly works for you.
- It's a really short position.
- Pretty sure since we started recording,
he's been trying to find, he's been going,
"I hope someone brings up leaving toilets
"in the right direction
"so that my business corner segue works."
- Business corner, bingo.
- This is a really quick one.
This is retail business corner.
- Okay.
- You are not alone in turning right.
Generally people, as they enter retail outlets,
the natural tendency will be to turn right.
You need to put your high value items
and the things that you wanna sell on the right hand side
because that is where people will go naturally first.
Right hand wall towards the front.
- Can we do random question?
You both walk into your grocery store.
Do you go left or right first?
- Depends on the store.
- Well, that actually works well,
what Andrew said for your question, Jason,
because I think we always turn right.
Because when I think about our local Coles,
Woolies, I think maybe in nearby suburbs,
the one exception,
but most of the entrances are to the right
and they take you straight to produce
in the bakery to the right.
So you're kind of guided that way with that bias.
- Our produce is to the left.
- Well, ours is a bit,
I have differences depending on the shop layout.
There's no consistency.
There's no consistency.
Is that what's going on here?
But we drive on the left and you're on the-
See, this is all wacky.
It's all wrong.
Produce Coriolis effect, I think is what that is.
Anyway, that was Business Corner.
Tight 30.
Tight 30.
Hope Zachary enjoyed that.
He's going to be thrilled about that.
All right, Jason, what do you do?
Other than turn right and not left, but also not.
Two things came to mind.
One was, and I don't think this really, anybody knows this happens, so maybe it's just annoying
to me, but in the world of Zoom calls for work, I will get an alert that a call is coming
up in one minute, and then I will go and sit there at, if the call is at nine, at 8.59,
I will sit there hovering over the join call button for an entire minute before I join.
It makes sense.
So once it hits exactly nine, then I'll click it.
Even though I've been there for an entire 60 seconds.
Affectionately on time.
I wait.
I wait until it's the exact time, and then I click it really quick.
I do a similar thing, and I have a reason.
But what's your reason?
Okay.
Oh, I just I think my brain doesn't make sense.
I don't know.
I don't know why I do that.
I just feel like that is the thing I'm supposed to do.
I think it's better than people who try and click the link at nine o'clock and then realize they've got a zoom update and realize that their microphone isn't plugged in and they realize all these other things.
That that could be like in the back of my mind probably is like I don't want to be late because some shit happened like I want to be like ready and then like ah got it.
So that could be part of it.
That's true.
I could see that.
We'll see where I work.
I think we've covered this in episode before I use Teams
and I try to make a habit of doing it on the dot
or the minute, like within the minute that follows.
And that's mainly because a lot of people actually join
before, which I find puts undue pressure on people.
Like quite often they're coming out of another meeting.
I'll be in the middle of some other work,
but then it pops up on your screen.
If you have the desktop notifications enabled,
which you kind of have to in order to get your updates,
Then it's like call started.
And if it's five or six minutes early, which often happens, it's like, I'm not ready yet.
What are they going to be talking about?
The reason the start time is there is because that's when you're starting.
That's a very good point.
Good on your Microsoft enabling business and productivity once again.
Business corner again.
There it is.
Office 365 brought to you by Office 365.
Teams still sucks, by the way.
I predicted this would be a tight 30 show and we're at 52 minutes and 15 seconds.
So who knows what they'll be after I edit it?
Yeah, probably longer somehow.
Maybe you can somehow stretch it out.
I don't know.
Maybe I'll just record that dance party you were having on zoom before I got here and just play that forever.
That'd be good.
That would be good.
Doodling and playing music.
People missed out on that one.
That was weird.
So that's 2022 for Hemispheric Views.
That's it.
This is the last one potentially ever.
- This is the moment where I have to take a little pause
and just say to all our listeners, you know who you are.
All the people in this guild, you know who you are.
All the people that pay the One Prime Plus tribute,
you know who you are.
Thank you for your support of our show this year.
We really enjoy it.
We would probably do it if you weren't listening anyway,
because we just like doing the show,
but it certainly makes it more worthwhile to know
that somebody is listening to our guff.
Thank you, I wish you a happy new year
from all of us at Homestretch Groups.
(upbeat music)
- Actually, Jason, can you just do like that horn noise
after the music finishes, you know that,
(imitates horn)
Can you do that?
Do I have that still?
- No, no, no, no, I want you to do it with your mouth.
- Oh.
(imitates air horn)
- So good at that.
Viva Zyla.
(coughing)
