Hi, I'm Andrew.

And I'm Jason.

And I'm Martin.

This is Hemispheric Views.

[Music]

Andrew's hand scribing his with a pencil.

Good.

That'll be good.

That'll be helpful.

So you'll do the strike through?

Can you do the strike throughs then with your pencil?

Is that?

Ah, well, I can't on my screen.

You probably won't see it.

Oh, okay.

Well, you could put your pencil on your screen.

Just do it.

It's all right.

Eh, it's only a Dell screen.

Who cares?

You're a pencil guy.

Remember the Mitsubishi?

I was meant to do research on that, wasn't I?

Haven't yet got to the research on the Mitsubishi.

Stand by.

There goes that follow up.

Okay.

We're doing live.

Let's just maybe move that to the end.

Okay.

Potentially.

I'm going to show you that this is a smooth writing pencil for office use and the office

use is in a different font.

Do you know what my favorite font is?

Tell me.

Oneprimeplus.com.

That's my favorite font.

It's not actually a font yet, but someday it may be.

What would the font look like?

Probably Helvetica.

Yeah.

Not Aptos?

Why not Aptos?

It's quite lovely Aptos.

I like it.

I'm glad they chose that.

Probably not, I reckon if it were kind of like Helvetica, just to troll people because

that's the spirit of one prime plus one of the letters in the alphabet in that typeface

would be from Ariel.

Oh, there you go.

And people have to try to identify which one it is.

Oh, that's great.

Yeah.

Maybe a Times New Roman, just for fun.

Yeah.

When you change it to like a bold oblique, then it would become a Times New Roman character.

Times New Roman.

And it only works on Windows.

Perfect.

I bring up the new font that does not exist yet because do you remember last episode when

there was a new one prime plus member announcement?

Do you recall that?

It was two weeks ago.

Well guess what?

One prime plus dot com new member Jim M. That's tough to say.

Jim M. Welcome to one prime plus dot com.

Where it is in the long game, as they say.

Much easier if you just say Jim.

Jim.

Jimmy.

Can we go with Jimmy?

Yeah, that's fine.

Yeah.

Jim, you can let us know if Andrew's allowed to call you Jimmy.

Or do we call him James?

Usually you get them to cancel within the first day.

So yeah, I think let's go with Jimmy.

Okay, let's go Jimmy.

Yep, yep.

Well, thanks Jimmy.

And we'll be getting that refund to you straight away.

Thanks for your one month contribution.

You got some stickers out of it, so it's not all bad.

Because we do give, when people sign up to one prime plus, they do have the option.

We don't force it upon them, but they do have the option to collect some limited edition

stickers.

Yeah, that includes the $10,000 sticker.

We get to make a sale on that one.

No, someday.

We haven't pushed it very hard.

But yeah, if you'd like to get your own piece of Hemispheric Views memorabilia for the low,

low price of $10,000.

USD.

Just go to our sticker store and you can buy one.

Buy two.

One would make it all worth it.

That's all we have to do.

Just one sale.

That would make it entirely worth it.

Actually, I think buy three.

One for each of us.

And then we each profit 10 grand.

And that might actually start to cover our costs on this thing over the three years that

we've been doing it.

I like it.

Yeah.

I mean, Christmas is right around the corner.

It's just right there.

Right.

It's Christmas in July.

Yeah.

So.

EOFI.

I went into Officeworks the other day and they had the EOFI signage up.

And I got to admit, I got a little excited.

I was going to take a photo, but I was too focused on the job at hand.

So I didn't.

But I thought of you guys and I thought of the Hemispheric Views nation.

I was like, EOFI time.

It's a time to celebrate.

What was the job at hand?

I was looking for a pen.

But you're a pencil guy.

It's confusing.

Yeah, I know.

I know.

I was talking to somebody at work and they were using a pen and I liked it.

And so I was like, I'm going to buy a pen just like that.

So I went to Officeworks.

Did you find the pen?

No.

They did.

They did have the pen.

They had it, but they had it in a four pack and I didn't want four of them.

I only wanted two.

So I left.

I didn't buy it.

I went to Woolworths.

But you're going to lose them.

No, I went to Woolworths.

And not only did they have the pen in a two pack, it was cheaper.

So that was a big adventure.

People wondering, probably saying, "Pen?

What pen?"

Well, it's a Sharpie S-Gel.

And I got it in black ink.

Can I, can I segue off of that?

Sure.

I have a top travel tip related to the Sharpie pen that I'm showing you right now.

Okay.

Let's call this a PSA on travel.

A TSA pre-essay.

PSA, TSA.

I don't know.

Figure it out in post.

So don't travel with these pens in your pocket on an airplane because they will explode and

shoot massive amounts of black Sharpie ink all over your pocket due to atmospheric conditions.

So top tip, don't do that.

Found that one out the hard way.

It did.

Yes.

I reached in my pocket and then inadvertently touched my face.

And then I had ink everywhere.

My hand was covered.

My face was covered.

It was a disaster.

Who left their squid on this plane?

Yeah.

And it was a Sharpie.

So you know that came off real easy.

Love the pen.

Don't fly with it.

So fly with the pencil.

Sponsor today, Sharpie pen.

Before we do any more corners, we have another announcement.

A pre-flight announcement.

Oh, what do we got?

Pre-flight announcement.

We are in the midst.

We're thick into June at this point, halfway through, which means it is our annual Arcadia

June super event.

This season featuring not one, but two Arcadia games to play.

You can play the Arcadia game classic, or you can play Arcadia sports.

We are accepting score, high scores from any of those games, any of the mini games within

those two games.

And we've even got some coupon codes.

Coupons?

What do you call them?

Voucher codes?

Gift codes?

What do you call these things?

Coupon.

I think that's a, yeah.

Anyway, just send an email to hello@hemisphereatuse.com.

Going to be real simple.

Send emails.

Hello@hemisphereatuse.com.

We got some, tell us which game you prefer, whether it's the arcade, the sports.

We'll fire you a coupon code if we have any left.

Thank you to Raffaele for the donation of those codes.

We want everybody to play, but if you get a code, you got to submit scores.

So we would love to get your scores.

You can email them to us, but we find most people enjoy submitting them through the Discord

server.

And we've got a leaderboard up to date, which is live on the web.

So you can see at any point how you're going.

Has your best score been beaten?

Interestingly enough, I don't know whether they're like stepping back this year, our

champions, particularly Eric, haven't seen much action from Eric recently.

I don't know if he's just decided to give it away or is he just giving everybody false

hope until, you know, he'll snipe us on the 29th of June.

And also Tashkan, no Bricko action yet.

So I'm interested to see what happens there when Brick, when she gets to playing Bricko

on her watch again.

So everybody else, but without those two entrants, everybody else is actually in with the chance.

So I encourage you get your scores in Arcadia, Arcadia June, Hemisphere of Use, get on board.

I hope everyone does well, but I do actively encourage Eric to crush everyone at the end

if he wants to, because that would be very amusing.

And I don't want him to like just dip out for the sake of it.

If you're a busy man, we understand, but Eric, you do you.

And if you want to see what the trophies, what the first place trophy looks like for

the last three consecutive years, shoot Eric an email because he has all of them.

Yes, he's all very good at Arcadia.

He's a champion.

But maybe not this year.

Don't give up hope.

Get on board Arcadia.

I want to know what you're talking about here with this Mac OS app, Windows.

Talk me through this.

I'm intrigued.

Yeah, I put something in the notes that says, how do you know a Mac OS app was actually

a Windows app?

It was Java.

That is a tell for sure.

Yes.

If it comes up and says you need to install Java, then run away.

This came up recently.

I don't even remember what the app was because I deleted it because it upset me.

But I think you're all familiar with this.

Anyone on the Mac is probably familiar with this where you download something you're not

super familiar with it.

You're thinking, I'm going to give it a try.

And you run through a couple of red flags along the way getting to that application.

First red flag, you open it and it is like an installer instead of just a drag to your

applications folder.

And that installer looks like it's like Mac OS 7.

You're like, ooh, OK, well, all right, I'll click next a few times and see where this

goes.

And the installer finishes.

Sometimes if you're super lucky, it then says you need to restart your computer to run this

application.

You're like, wow, this is Windows XP.

Awesome.

OK, I hate you now.

So you're already kind of on the shit list because I'm not going to.

Why am I going to restart?

I don't restart my computer, but like once every month.

I don't want to do that.

But let's say let's say you're lucky.

You don't need to restart.

And then you think, I'm going to go open this application.

Maybe you use a launcher.

Maybe you already forgot what it was called.

So you're going to go look at your applications folder.

You're looking at your applications folder and you're like, where is this application?

Why is it not here?

I cannot find it.

Oh, I have it filtered to have folders at the top of my folders in Finder.

And they have put the app in a folder inside applications.

Ugh, gross.

What are you doing?

It's not Win32/applicationdata/what?

No, stop it.

Program files.

Get out of here with that.

That is just infuriating.

And that is just some of the ways you know this app was never meant to be on Mac OS.

Have you run into this?

Yeah, I have.

I think what's most distressing, I think, is the look of that progress bar that you

brought up at the beginning.

Because that alone, you've had that warning point.

You've kind of crossed this first threshold where you go, do I waste my time on this?

And sometimes it's OK, but I'd say very rarely it is.

But you kind of hold out hope that it's going to be OK, that something is going to work

out.

And look, I have a good example of this, actually, because we've discussed in Photography Corner

before and brought up cameras and stuff.

I like OM cameras, formerly Olympus.

And they have an app called OM Workspace.

And pretty much all camera manufacturers will make apps for editing their specific RAW files.

Now I don't need this.

I'm happy using Photos or Photomator or whatever else.

But you go, you know what?

I'm going to have a go at the thing that is calibrated for their color science.

And you open it up.

And oh my god, I want to use these tools to experiment with it.

But exactly like you said, it opens up with this just terrifying Windows-looking thing.

And then nowadays, like when I've tried to use it just out of curiosity, maybe things

have been updated to match firmware of cameras or something.

I don't know.

It just doesn't even open.

It's like, you know what?

It's not even functional anymore.

This thing is designed for Windows so much that it refuses to actually open on your Mac.

So yeah, so that kind of spiraled out of control.

I've got to be angry very quickly.

But the answer is yes, Jason, I've had that problem.

Andrew, what kind of Windows apps are you running on your Mac?

I can't really remember and recall instances like this.

Probably I haven't got one.

I was just looking at my applications folder.

And at the moment, I am nested folder free.

So I don't have any apps that are doing that sort of thing.

The one that I recall most recently, I don't know whether I had a folder within a folder

in the install, but the install was not right.

And the whole application didn't look great, was my previous editing software.

What was that thing called?

Hindenburg.

Very much like the name.

I mean, it followed its own kind of legacy, didn't it?

Oh, look, I check in on the Hindenburg people from time to time to still find out whether

they've instituted the strip silence feature.

The one that I've been relying on incredibly in ferrite as I edit this podcast for the

last three years.

There's a discussion forum checking every now and then.

It's been going back since I was using Hindenburg, this thread.

And yeah, no progress.

So Hindenburg, I'm kind of glad I was off that.

It looked very Windows-y.

It had a weird interface.

Did not feel Mac-like.

Instead, that installer, every time I see it, it's just like, oh, I think we're done

here.

It's the dialogue boxes.

You know, they look really chunky and it still has sort of like the real three dimensional

buttons.

It does not instill confidence that the rest of my experience is going to be super great

or modern.

You know, the number of times you have that installer and then an application that looks

like it was actually made in 2024, not a one to one ratio.

And then if you want to get rid of the application, do you have to hold on to the installer file

so you can sort of uninstall?

Oh God, I forgot about that too.

Yes, to get rid of something.

It's like stuck in like utilities slash whatever slash whatever.

And then you have to go do that.

Oh yeah, that's another good one.

A specific uninstaller.

And it still doesn't get rid of everything.

Let's be real.

It still leaves a bunch of crap everywhere.

Com.crapapp.we suck.

Oh, I love it.

Something else I don't like, sorry, now we're getting a bit negative.

So for example, most Apple apps don't do this, but maybe it's, correct me if I'm wrong, maybe

you two know, but maybe it's like a pro level app thing.

So when you open up Final Cut Pro, for example, which I love, it's arguably the best application

on the Mac.

I know what you're going to say.

What is it?

Let's see it.

What is it?

It runs like 75,000 little like executable things in the dock, like a little carousel

when you first run it.

No, I haven't actually had that so much.

It's more that when you open it, you get that little splash screen window that says the

title of the app.

Kind of like what you would get with Photoshop or like Affinity as well, which does those

really nice, you know, publisher, designer, photo apps.

To me, like if we're getting kind of Steve Jobsian about it, the magic of something just

opening and working, I don't really need to see the name of the app coming up in a window

that I can't do anything with before it's actually ready to open.

I don't want that.

And no other Apple apps do that.

But Final Cut Pro does like other non Apple made things.

I find that a bit like, that's a very, very nitpicky thing, but I don't like that.

But yes, the executable thing, I've seen that in other processes before, but not Final Cut.

I think like every time you update Final Cut Pro, I feel like, and then you launch it for

that first time after update, and then it does like 59 little terminal things in the

dock.

Right.

Whoa, what is happening?

Maybe I forgot.

If you didn't know what was going on, you'd be like, I have been compromised for sure.

Surely someone is doing something nefarious on my computer.

Yeah, you can actually probably, if you could record that, because I've seen it before for

other things like flashing around in the dock and then set that to Sandstorm.

That could be quite a good music video.

For sure.

That would be the visual.

That would be the Winamp visualization for that song.

I think the only software I still have installed on my Mac that has a splash screen are probably

the Microsoft apps, which are very on brand.

Anytime you load Excel, Word, whatever, they give up.

They bring up their splash.

They just can't help themselves to call Microsoft.

And those apps still take a bloody long time to load.

Yeah, that's like an old school psychological thing where they would load those to make

you feel like it was fast or like it was actually loading while they were trying to actually

churn through crap in the background.

Those apps are so mad.

They must be so massive because they are so slow to load.

Yeah.

Do you know how much information is taken to render like impact WordArt at size 240

font?

That's a big, that's a big deal.

I'm pretty sure all those apps just come with like wine attached to them.

They're just running an emulation probably.

Right?

They have to be.

Wow.

Yeah.

So there you go.

That's how to know if your Mac OS app is really a Windows app in disguise.

It's traveling tech lot.

Oh yeah.

Travel corner.

Insert theme.

It's travel corner.

Welcome.

Welcome to you.

Your flight is now departing.

Travel corner tech edition.

I traveled recently and generally laptop taking it with me.

This time I said no, no, I'm going to bring the inferior laptop, the iPad.

Hey, I'm going to bring that.

And then I said, no, I'm only bringing my phone.

Ooh, what?

Only your phone.

What are you, a normal person?

I know.

So I got my, uh, my little peak camera bag and I said, I'm only bringing things that

fit in this tiny peak camera bag.

I'm not even bringing a backpack.

Who am I?

I'm a monster.

Not bringing a backpack.

That's like how you can get work done on holiday.

You can't get work done without a backpack.

It's crazy.

So I brought this little bag.

Are you carrying like your cameras on a belt holster now or something?

What's that about?

No, it's, it's like, it's a, it's a little shoulder bag thing.

It's a peak.

Oh, it'll be in the notes.

I forgot.

It's the peak design 15 something little slingy thing.

It's very small.

Almost looks like a, like a, it'll be in the notes anyway.

So cameras in there.

Check.

Phone can fit in there going through the airport.

Check.

You're not fitting an iPad in there.

You're not fitting a laptop.

Only bringing a phone, headphones.

I brought my play date.

And I think that was kind of it.

Then just some like, Oh, playing cards and like little ancillary crap.

But I traveled without like a quote unquote computer for the first time in I probably

ever probably since I was like three years old, I would guess.

And everything was fine.

Did you miss it?

No, it was, it was all completely fine.

I had one panic moment where, cause I was bringing a camera and I was in my head.

I'm thinking like, I get a little anxious with everything being on an SD card and it's

like, Oh, I really like if I have a computer, I can kind of dump off the SD card and have

at least two copies of it.

Whereas if the card dies, I'm just kind of screwed.

So I had a little panic moment.

I shot a quick text over to Gabby, friend of Hemispheric views, and I expressed my concern

and he said, why don't you just bring one of those little SD card dongle things and

plug it into your phone?

I was like, Oh, I use that.

Holy crap.

Genius.

Yes.

And I have one of those little USB C thingies.

So I brought that, tested it out and you can just dump everything right to your local storage

on your phone.

There you go.

Files.app.

Apparently not as terrible as the internet wants you to believe it is.

It works fine.

So yeah, super ultra compact travel edition, phone only.

You can travel without a laptop.

On your whole thing about importing the files app, I was thinking, why is he doing that?

But then it just occurred to me on your Berk.photo site, you've got that whole workflow for the

very specific order and how you upload things.

So to actually go straight into photos would compromise your process, right?

Yes.

Correct.

Yeah.

I like to pre-sort before just dumping everything into photos.

Yeah.

So you're still civilized.

Like you didn't travel with a proper computer, as you say, but you're not an animal, right?

How many days?

How many?

Four days.

Okay.

Cause I'm traveling later this month.

Yeah.

I feel like I need, I feel like I, how can I leave a computer behind?

Just saying.

I thought the same thing.

Trust me.

I went from full on backpack with 16 inch computer and everything else down to smaller

backpack with iPad and less stuff down to tiny bag with just my phone.

And it worked.

It was fine.

It was totally fine.

Yeah.

I think the way that I'd kind of reason with this is unless you're traveling for work and

you specifically need a computer, let's just say you're going down the leisure path, right?

You're traveling for a holiday.

I reckon you only really need to take something like a different computer or small iPad or

something if you're traveling internationally, right?

Because if you're in a different country and something happens to your phone, and that

really is the key to your life and getting anywhere, like you might even have tickets

or itineraries or something saved on your phone.

You really do probably need something in case everything goes wrong.

But if you're traveling domestically, yeah, just if you're traveling domestically, it's

like it's an annoying thing, but you can survive.

So travel light.

God, maybe you should try it.

Just do it.

It was pretty freeing.

Leave an adapter or whatever to save some weight.

Who cares?

Yeah.

Just bring this for your camera and you're good to go.

Well, what if I don't even travel with a camera?

What if I just go like...

Oh, you're...

I find it doesn't matter at all because all your photos are uploading anyway, and you

could chuck your phone in the ocean if you want.

Who cares?

Yeah.

Who cares?

Don't even take clothes.

Just go.

Birthday suit.

Yeah.

I keep seeing articles about people flying from WA that are streaking down the center

of the Qantas flights.

So the only thing is, that's just OK there.

It's five hours.

As long as you have your Hiveiz vest.

That's the one thing.

Yeah, you got to cover up with that.

But have your Hiveiz.

It's five hours on a plane, like just to get anywhere.

That's the only thing that worries me.

Like five hours without an iPad screen.

Well, that's your choice living in Perth, isn't it?

We're all over here having a great time.

Everyone's right next to each other.

That's your problem.

Just get a bigger phone.

Oh, God, I already got a bigger phone.

Don't make me get a bigger, bigger phone.

Have your hands grown again?

Oh, I have noticed this phone is like, doesn't really fill the hand.

God, your hands are large.

They're not that big.

No, I'm not saying it to belittle you.

How could I?

They're big.

I checked out the new iPad the other day and I was tempted by the 13 because I'm like,

they're so skinny now.

It's like you can basically hold it in one hand.

Yeah, the thickness of the iPad was definitely the problem that was that needed to be solved

for sure.

I found the screen to be too bright when I looked at it in the store.

I was like, I have to turn that right down.

That's a very bright screen.

Was it just up because of the fact that it was in daylight or there was?

It was a showroom one.

So it was probably cranked, you know?

Yeah.

I was like, wow, I only looked at it for 30 seconds.

And then Benji, Benji, where's the wisdom of children?

Do you know what Benji said?

He's like, dad, turn the brightness down.

No, he said that that's just like, that's just like the iPad you already have.

It's a little bit different.

It's newer, but it's basically the same iPad.

And then he said, I've got an iPad.

I've got an older iPad, don't I, dad?

And I said, yes, you do.

And he's like, my iPad's still fine.

We don't need to look at these iPads.

Let's go.

It's like, that is a smart boy, eight year old, bloody telling me how to run my life.

And that's why you should be more negative.

Be more negative.

Yeah. He's like, hey, all these iPads run the exact same iPad OS you already had.

Don't expect them to be different.

But you can make a 45 minute video about it if you like.

Incidentally, he loves his be more negative T-shirt.

Oh, man.

That is, that is a kid.

Jason's still traumatised by that.

Like his entire American spirit, everything that, you know, like defines America and the dream has been crushed by the one child from Western Australia.

I'm never going to be accepting of this ever.

I regret ever making the logo.

It's just, it's a, it's a, it's a tarnish on my record.

You make him very happy.

He goes around, he still says it.

He's like, be more negative.

That's my catch, Cora, my catchphrase.

He loves it.

Oh, I'm so happy.

You can't be anything but, Jason.

What is everyone's preferred hotel breakfast?

Now, I don't know, Jason, if you were in a hotel, I know you do camping and stuff sometimes, but I just thought when you're in a hotel, you really are in the situation where you've paid to be in presumably decent luxury or comfort if you can afford it.

Right.

Pillows are often a bit ordinary.

Maybe the mattresses are okay, whatever.

But generally you go, oh, that's a nice view.

This is a good room.

But food, like you're at the mercy of other people at some sort of downstairs cafe or bistro or buffet.

And you're always that little bit hopeful that the food will be okay.

I would like to know, and I have my own thoughts on this, but I'd like to know, what do you want to see when you go to a hotel and breakfast is on offer?

Andrew, maybe starting with you.

I like the alphabetical thing.

Okay.

Is this in Australia?

Oh, anywhere.

Anywhere.

Within, within reason that you could maybe get what you want.

But just saying selfishly, you're in a hotel.

What do you want or what do you hope to see?

Okay.

Because there's two different answers.

If I'm in America, my answer is very different.

And, but yeah, in Australia, in Australia, it is, I'm basically going to, I'm going to avoid, assuming cost is no object, and you know, hotels sting you crazily.

But okay.

I'm not getting continental breakfast.

Do not even come at me with like some bloody cereal and like crackers or something.

It's like, no, no, I am here.

If I'm in a hotel, half the reason is because somebody is going to cook me breakfast.

I'm having a cooked breakfast.

That is number one.

And generally in Australia, that's somewhat limited.

I don't feel like we're really great at breakfasts.

So I'm probably going to get a lot of bacon.

I'm going to get baked beans because I love me some baked beans.

Probably eggs, but it'll probably just be the scrambled ones.

If they have any pastries, I am, now I just said no continental.

I don't know if pastries considered continental, whether you pay for that.

It's on the cusp.

But I am-

On their own, it would be continental, but you want the option.

Yeah, I want them in addition.

So like, I want all that like-

It's a different tier of pastry.

There's the continental tier of pastry, and then there's the upper echelon tier of pastries.

And I'm not talking like a croissant that I have to like chuck jam into and stuff and get flakes everywhere.

No, I'm talking about those like sugar, creamy, like I've got a fruity kind of thing in the middle of them.

A bit of glaze.

Like a Danish?

Yeah, yeah, probably Danish.

Thank you.

That's what I want.

But I want about five of them.

Basically, I want one of every flavour.

So that's kind of- And then I want about three cups of coffee.

And I want an orange juice, probably an apple juice as well.

That's-

You have got like a digestive storm happening over there.

Like you're just exploding.

You are straight to the toilet after this.

I kid you not.

You are straight to the toilet.

There is strategy to this.

Point of the hotel breakfast is that you must eat enough that you do not need to spend more money of your like holiday money on lunch.

You need to be able to skip lunch entirely and still feel great.

So you've got to load up at breakfast time.

And if you can smuggle it- If you smuggle like a little cupcake, sometimes they're little cupcakes.

If you can grab a couple of those and stuff them in your pockets as like a little mid-morning snack, that's still valid.

So let me get this right.

You go to the hotel, whether it's a work trip or, you know, if a family holiday or something, you load up, bloat yourself and essentially like walk down the street farting and burping through every tourist destination just so you can save money on lunch.

Yep.

Wow.

Okay.

That went way further than what I thought it would.

But I'm very grateful that I asked.

If I'm in America, just to finish my thought, if I'm in America, I want- I definitely want pancakes because Americans do excellent pancakes.

And I want- If I'm in the south, I want biscuits with that white sauce gravy stuff.

Biscuits and gravy.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's real good.

So you're talking about biscuits like Americans say it.

America.

Yeah.

Like scones.

They're like scones.

Scones.

Don't even start on- I think we covered this many episodes ago.

We did, but they've got this white sauce and it's so delicious.

But it's so regional.

What's the white sauce?

I don't know.

Gravy.

It's gravy.

Gravy, but-

It's bloody delicious.

Is it made from chicken meat or something?

Because gravy is normally brown.

No, it's a- It's usually like a beef based gravy.

It's- Yeah, it's real good.

Why is it white?

I don't know.

Because of whatever's in it.

It's really good.

It's really good.

It's not like a turkey gravy.

It's a different kind of gravy.

I feel like Neatnik might be able to send me some of that.

Maybe he could help us out.

He's in the south, isn't he?

He's probably making some right now.

Man.

That's what I want.

Is white beef gravy like a benefit of Omgalol?

I don't know.

It should be then.

Yeah.

If you're- Yeah.

If you subscribe for a full year, you get a quart of gravy mailed to you.

Wow.

You okay?

I'm renewing my subscription right now.

This was a lot more than I thought it would be.

So there you go.

That's my breakfast.

You asked, I answered.

Jason.

I like it.

That sounds pretty good.

That's a lot of food.

I have to say that's a way bigger breakfast than I'm prepared for.

I do like the thievery at the end though.

I like the trying to smuggle things out wrapped in napkins or something.

That's exactly what you think.

Sounds very exciting.

Fold it up.

You just have like a half smashed pastry in your pocket at 2 PM.

That sounds great.

Let's see.

Breakfast at the hotel.

Wow.

I think usually I will get things that I would not normally eat.

Like I'll get like bacon or sausage or something, potentially do an eggs.

Sunny side up, obviously, because you got to get that good goo factor.

The chicken liquid.

Yep.

The proper chicken liquid way to eat an egg as everyone knows by now.

I like when there's variety because I don't know if I'm going to want cereal.

I don't know if I want pancakes.

I don't know if I want eggs and bacon.

I don't know what I want.

I want to go down there and I want to be able to peruse the situation and take a

couple of laps and see what's available.

Maybe walk around some of the tables, see what other people are eating.

See if they're leaving it behind.

Cause it wasn't that good.

Get a good feel, engage for everything that's available and then go to town.

My biggest thing that I absolutely really, really want is actual orange juice.

Not this like borderline orange juice, like concentrate stuff.

I want like good chunky orange juice.

That's the one thing I just really want.

Yeah.

Pulpy, pulpy orange juice.

That's Rachel.

I just like pure liquid one.

Like, no, I don't want that.

Like I'll just have tag at that point.

Uh, and then coffee.

Coffee is basically always shit at every hotel for the most part.

And that's upsetting.

So usually I will go out to find the local best coffee shop that has 4.2 or more stars

on the, on the rating system, get a coffee there, then come back and get breakfast.

That's the go-to move for me from a coffee situation.

I have a question.

May I, can I interrupt with a question about the coffee?

You, you may.

Because Americans, it seems like even when you go to a coffee shop, you still just end

up getting coffee basically out of a big urn.

The percolator.

Yeah.

So what's the difference?

I think you're, I think you're not going to the 4.2 stars plus.

But if we go to a coffee shop in Australia, we're getting like, we've discussed this

before, we're getting like a flat white or a cappuccino or something.

We're getting something where they're having to froth milk to a texture, heat,

consistency, and then they're adding a custom blend bean.

Right.

Coffee from a hotel is usually in the little pourer thingy bit, Bob, and it's just

black coffee.

That's been French press.

Yeah, but it's like crappy pre-ground stuff that has been ground three years ago and is

awful.

I want to go out and get a nice freshly ground pour over black coffee because it's

delicious.

It's fresh.

And I have a palate with taste and I don't want to just drink a glass of milk.

So that is my go-to for that.

Okay.

And so when you get to a coffee shop, you get basically it's a big, long, just a

black coffee.

Black coffee.

That's my, that's my go-to.

Yeah.

Sometimes honey, maybe a little local honey in there would be good, but straight.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's not bad actually.

Yeah.

And instead of like a sugar or something, like if I want to give it a little

sweetness, uh, put a little honey in there, that's really good.

But generally just, uh, just black coffee is just, I just, I like the, the flavor and

the tones of the coffee.

I don't want to mask it.

Have you ever had an almond flat white?

Oh yeah.

I've had, I've had plenty of like espresso based beverages and things.

Okay.

They're fine too.

It's just not my, my preferred.

Okay.

I think of those like dessert.

Coffee to me is like a, like a black coffee is like just a staple item.

And I think of things like espresso based stuff, they have a latte, whatever, that

kind of stuff as like more of a, a special one-off thing that I don't want all the

time.

Interesting.

Yeah.

Australia would basically disagree with you, which is fascinating.

Cause that's like the morning staple.

People do drink black coffee in Australia, but not like, cause I know what you're

getting at Andrew, you watch any kind of American movie, whether it's really

stereotypical with like a diner or something, or even just like an everyday show, you

know, now it's the black coffee thing.

Whereas Australians aren't really as into that.

And if you do see black coffee, it's like just in an Escafe blend 43 instant ad

where they're pouring it.

Yeah.

I'm sorry for the sidebar away from breakfast, but I just had to clear that up.

Coffee is never a sidebar.

Coffee is breakfast.

I mean, let's be real.

If there's anything you're going to not take out of the equation, it's that.

Everything else can just right off.

But if you take the coffee away, why are we even here?

You know, he's walking the talk.

Cause he's actually walked out of the building to get it.

Like the breakfast is secondary.

If at all, like he's prioritized.

I may not come back.

I may get distracted down a, down an alley and just forget that where I'm even

staying.

So who knows?

Lost his key card.

Can't get back in.

At least I've got my coffee.

Yeah.

I'll be good to go for at least four hours.

I agree with lots of things that you've both said.

I don't necessarily, I wouldn't go to the length that Andrew has in basically eating all three meals in the morning, you know, to save on the depreciation spreadsheet or whatever budget he has.

Would you put the muffins in your pocket?

No.

Okay.

Well, there's a great point.

I talking about freshness.

I don't really want to carry muffins around.

Like if we're talking school lunches back.

You have to have a muffin on at the ready at any point.

You never know when that kid's going to get hungry.

Yeah, we pack food for him, but I'm not, I'm not taking a portable muffin to go for myself generally.

If I'm desperate or I know that I'm not gonna be able to eat, then I'll, I'll submit to that.

But it's not like I have to remember the thing that's warming up in my backpack for the next few hours.

And then I forget about it and then it's a mush by the end of the day.

No, thank you.

It's like school lunches.

I did not do sandwiches in like cling or glad wrap.

No, thank you.

No, it, it needs to be a fresh item out of like the cabinet or assembled at the time.

Sorry if that's a bit too far.

But when it comes to hotel breakfasts, buffets and stuff are good.

I've traveled with work friends or workmates a couple of times and then into the omelettes.

Yeah, Craig's one of them.

Hi, Craig.

Also, Tim.

They're big omelette fans, big on the omelette.

And, you know, I support that because it doesn't have obvious chicken liquid.

I don't normally order them for myself because I'm happy with whatever scrambled option they have.

But what I would sort of get to is that as much as I like that hotel buffet breakfast, going to going to hotels where they actually have a cafe style restaurant downstairs where you go and order and it's a menu and they will do things like smashed avocado for you with dukkah or something.

Or they'll do nice pancakes or like kind of vegetarian breakfast options with awesome mushrooms and roasted tomatoes.

The things that you could maybe get from the buffet, but you can go, you know what, I want to target and order this thing.

And then generally they will also have, wait for it, decent coffee because they have an espresso machine there and you don't have to leave the premises.

So I feel like Australians, I don't want to say snobby, but I feel like Australians have become so used to the cafe lifestyle of being able to order the flat white or the cappuccino or whatever, that it's now being embedded, like included in places like hotel restaurants because they don't want you to do what Jason's just said and leave and go and get coffee somewhere else.

They want you to stay and have the cafe style thing.

And we had something like that recently.

Well, not recently, sometime last year when Natasha and I stayed in Sydney overnight.

And the funny thing was that I don't know how like, I don't want to say wealthy, but I don't want to say or assume how important we looked because we went downstairs and this guy who was at like, you know, sometimes have a little lectern or a stand where you walk into a restaurant.

They have the menus there, like basically like, please wait to be seated.

And he came up to us and started greeting us like we were corporate customers and trying to sign us up for some sort of corporate package.

I'm just here with my wife on like a weekend away.

And he's like, can we discuss some of the business options with you?

And I'm like, we're just here for breakfast.

So they've really upped the ante on the breakfast experience.

I'm not here representing canyon.blog/save, dude.

Like, chill out.

No, no.

And I doubt I would get any kind of commission if I even tried.

So don't bother.

Ah! Three beeps.

Three beeps.

Is that the episode record timer?

That's it.

Yep.

Time timers across the world have signified.

That was it.

A type 45.

That was it.

That was officially a type 45, even though it's still going after the beep.

It's like hands across America, but time timers across the world.

Time timers across the world.

So let me get this right.

Are we still recording?

And then the challenge for listeners is to work out how much was cut out in order for that to be the type 45, but it might have moved since Andrew did stuff.

Is that the idea?

Or are we actually stopping?

What's the rule on this?

Well, I'm going to edit something.

So we probably have like a couple more minutes.

I was thinking we could wrap up with the 1980s robot.

So this just came up because I went down memory lane of a old 1980s television show from Australia called Now You See It.

Apparently it's based on an American show.

So who knew that?

Two kids, a host, and they have to, uh, that they get quizzes.

And like, it was very electronic and fancy at the time because a letter would show up at the bottom.

And it was like a crossword in a way, but just a horizontal line.

And the quiz master would say something like, what do you, well, I remember the one I saw this morning.

What do you call a group of witches?

And the kids are like, and.

The coven.

You got it.

Jason, one point.

Yes.

But if you didn't know, the host would go, letter.

And then the C would light up.

And then the kids are still looking there like, and you get a letter.

And it would light up.

Oh, a coven.

Congratulations, Jason.

And then the next one would be like air conditioning.

And then like, so the, but then it would be like the ven bit of coven would become ventilation or something like that.

So it kind of added the, you had to think around these words.

Anyway, very technical because it had these little light things.

To carry on the theme of it being high tech.

When people walked out onto stage, like they had the Star Trek door that would open and the people would walk out.

Yeah, it was just one way though.

I think they only had one guy to pull the door, not two.

Okay.

Budget.

I get it.

The most technological aspect of the show was they had, the host was Mike Mead, but the co-host was Melvin the robot.

And Melvin was literally a robot.

He was like one of those little like remote control robot things.

And he would talk, but he talked and he moved around a bit.

And then, so that's one show little robot host guy.

Right.

And then we had perfect match and perfect match had Dexter and Dexter would issue like compatibility ratings for the couple that would go away on a honeymoon, like a date on the Gold Coast.

And he'd be like, your compatibility rating is 82%.

Now, all this goes to say is that in the 80s TV world, robots were just, they were coming.

And I had a true feeling that I was going to have a robot in my house that would walk around, make me a coffee, but it would be like a robot, like a little guy, you know, probably on wheels, carrying a little tray or something, but doing useful things.

Not by some tiny old man.

No.

No, no, no, no.

They're not like a cyborg, like a robot.

And all I've got after bloody 30 years of waiting, maybe even 40 years, I don't know how long I've been waiting.

It's been a bloody long time.

All I've got is a Roomba and a Siri that never answers me correctly.

And I feel bloody ripped off.

Where's my robot?

What?

But why do you want this?

Because they just look so excited.

Melvin was so clever and he knew answers and he was useful.

He'd like have a little chat.

It was like having a little friend, it was like a dog that you didn't have to really feed or pick up poo.

So I remember as a kid, even entering competition to win a robot that was much like Melvin.

It was like a word sleuth kind of game.

You had to find as many words as you could in this grid.

And me and my sister worked on it for like weeks, sent off an entry.

I still don't understand how we didn't win because it was, we found a lot of words.

We couldn't a lot of times.

So I really wanted a robot.

Didn't win it.

Never did have a robot.

So I'm sad.

And where's our robot?

We were promised a robot future and we haven't gotten it.

All companies care about is AI.

I don't care about AI.

Give me a robot.

I remember a ton of these ads for home robots that were meant to do things.

And the ads always looked so cool.

There'd be like my favourite one.

I forget what it was even for.

But if you only looked like one level deep on it, you're like, this is the most amazing thing ever.

But as soon as you went to like 1.5 levels deep on just thinking through how this was going to work, like it would be, there'd be a guy like sitting on a couch.

And then the robot would be dry, you know, walk.

They didn't walk.

They always had like wheels or whatever.

So it'd be like driving towards him, holding like a mixed cocktail.

And it would say like, you know, never get up to get a cocktail again or like some horse crap like that.

And you're like, oh, wow, that's so cool.

Like, that's just amazing.

And it's all running off like a cassette tape in its chest.

That's just so next level.

But then you would think for like a half a second more and you're like, well, wait a minute here.

Like first, your whole house has to be completely flat or else it can't go upstairs.

So how's that working?

Also, it's a foot and a half tall.

It can't even reach the counter or the bar or whatever it's meant to get.

It doesn't have hands.

It only has a tray.

So what's really going on?

Like this is not actually doing anything functional for you at all.

At best.

Who made the cocktail?

Yeah.

At best, it's being remote controlled over to another place where you're yelling across the house like, hey, make me whatever and put it on the little stupid robot.

So I could drive it back.

It's just like, yeah, they always looked really good until you thought about it for any more than two seconds.

But yeah, we still don't have them.

The kind of robotic future that I thought was maybe possible or at least semi practical was like what you see from Doc Emmett Brown and Back to the Future or Wallace and Gromit, where they have those, they have like an apparatus or a process, kind of like a domino effect where it passes one thing to the other and makes you toast.

It's like I can kind of see that because it has a supply at a certain time with a timer and we go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and then deliver the thing to you at the end rather than like a sentient creature around the house.

But yeah, we don't have that.

I don't have like a jam and toast machine going up the hallway to deliver something to me.

Unfortunately.

The closest we ever got to anything was electronic robots.

We never got mechanical robots.

So we only ever got like turn on the lights or like do something that's an electrical like on off gate.

Basically, we never got things that are physically going through the house other than yeah, like a Roomba or something that's basically a Roomba like, oh, this Roomba does snow.

Well, OK, cool.

Like it's still basically a Roomba.

It just does like a different it mows the lawn or.

Yeah, yeah.

I've got a Roomba for the swimming pool and it just.

Yeah, it's all basically the same.

Yeah, it's all the same thing, basically.

But even those are like you can't go upstairs still.

So now you got what a Roomba for every level of the house.

Like it's yeah.

It's not great.

The amount of times my Roomba gets stuck as well.

I'm like, how stupid are you?

Like you get stuck there every single time.

I've got to come and rescue you.

Like figure it out.

It's like the dish rack robots that they have in restaurants.

Now I've seen a couple of those and it's it's silly because this thing has to walk around.

Now you imagine in a busy place like a restaurant, right?

But then somewhere in your home it has to sing or play a jingle with a friendly face that walk through.

So you don't walk into it.

What's a dish rack robot?

Well, it's like this.

It's essentially like a mobile dish rack on wheels.

It's a robot that navigates kind of like a Roomba around a restaurant to collect dishes.

But it has to have like a smiley face or a cat face or a bow tie or something.

So it doesn't look like it's going to kill you.

And then it emits music.

It plays music so that you can hear it coming.

Because you can imagine someone not hearing something silently rolling between, you know, restaurant tables and you knock it over and you smash crockery everywhere.

So it's just silly.

There's this really dodgy shop over here.

It's like a really bad little deli, IGA.

And it has a robot that drives around like what you're describing.

And it's sort of advertising special, like the special product of the week or whatever.

But it's actually.

Like a spruiker on wheels.

Yeah, but it's actually just annoying because I don't know if it cleans the floor at the same time.

I think that's probably what it does.

I think it probably cleans the floor while it's at it.

But yeah, it's like here, have a dishwasher detergent this week.

And it's like, just get out of my way, robot.

I'm trying to find the chocolate.

And also, do you take like, could you literally just take one from him?

I feel like I'd be wrong.

Like, well, I'm sorry, I don't want to like take it from direct from your little tray.

Am I allowed?

Unless it was chocolate.

Is that like stealing from somebody else's shopping trolley?

You know, it's a weird thing.

So there are robots around, I guess.

I'd like to end this on a positive note for you, Andrew, because I feel like you've sort of, you look visibly upset by this.

I am.

The fact that your robot future hasn't come.

You got names like Melvin, Dexter.

If you could have your dream robot, one, what would it do for you at home?

And two, what name would you give it?

Oh, that's, that's really good.

It would be hard to go past Melvin, to be totally honest.

I do love that name for a robot.

But if I want to be unique, I'd probably call him probably Clive.

Clive the robot.

What does Clive do?

Clive.

Well, what does Clive, what doesn't Clive do?

Basically, he's like a butler.

He's just a, he's a jack of all trades.

If I, one of the key features that Clive would do, he would notice and remember where I put stuff.

So I would say, Clive, where's my, where to put my keys?

And he wouldn't just trigger an air tag.

He would go find the keys, right?

And I'd say, Clive, I need a spoon.

Can you get me a spoon?

And Clive would just trot off and get a spoon out of the drawer.

Yeah, just kind of useful.

Clive, boil the kettle.

He'd be on onto that.

That kind of useful, empty the laundry.

Just kind of that stuff.

Just keep the house moving.

So he's a general robotic maid, basically.

Yeah, yeah.

He'd wear a bow tie.

He would actually wear a bow tie.

A butler, a robotic butler.

That's what I want.

Okay.

If you could make me a snack.

So it'd be, it'd be Rosie from the Jetsons.

Yes.

Yes.

That's it.

But mine's Clive.

I'm just going to say there are no robots entering my house.

That's it.

ever. Martin has EMPs at the ready.
