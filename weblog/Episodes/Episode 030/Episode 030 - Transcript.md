*Joyful music*
Happy birthday. Thank you. Wow. That's a real- that's a treat!
That is amazing Jason. Thank you. Thank you. Oh my goodness. He's got cake
Is that a donut from that nearby donut shop? Sorry, I'm just having some birthday cake. I don't know what you guys are doing
Jason are you balancing something or holding on to string that you kind of look really like you're trying to hold something together
My hat balloons depending on you. I'll just the hat. Okay. Yeah, my my birthday hat. I'm having a birthday party over here
I don't know why you guys
But I'm in the wrong hemisphere. I really need to be there. Today's a big day. Yes it it is
It is true. It is my birthday. Actually the day is today.
Blow out your candle.
[blows out candle]
Wow. The magic of the internet.
You know what? I didn't even get a proper cake for myself.
My mother-in-law came over with a grocery store cake, mainly to keep my five-year-old son super happy.
So you said you felt old, Andrew. Does that mean are you now getting more excited about your birthday because of your kids the same way that parents do with Christmas?
Christmas. It's funny actually this this one has been kind of a joy because yeah
Benji has like this year Benji's tweaked into birthdays he's he's five and he's
sort of now being in school he's kind of really tweaked to what birthdays are so
he was telling me I needed to have like a badge and I need to sing a song for me
and everything and so so he's got this concept of what a birthday is and it's
the same for everybody irrespective of the age and it's so cute. What's the
Badge, oh like a birthday badge they wear at school when you're the birthday boy or the birthday girl
You wear like a special badge on your day just so that everybody knows and gives you special attention
Actually, this is a perfect segue though because I am under strict instructions on this podcast that I need to tell everybody
That Benji is having a spider-man birthday
for his next birthday
Okay, so it's really important that makes the edit and that stays in because he's expecting to hear me
Tell you guys about his spider-man birthday good on you Benji
Tip in case you forgot to give you that special someone a gift
You can give them this podcast you can give us give them a subscription to
One prime plus that is the best gift of all really when it comes down to gift-giving this holiday season
in the middle of June
You can be like, you can be like the three new patrons that are now a part of
the One Prime Plus friends and family. We've got Jennifer M, we've got Nick T,
and we have Raphael D. All new members to the One Prime Plus planet. So thank you
all for joining. We appreciate it. Make sure you go get all your new goodies
that you have in the in the archives of the Patreon safe that we keep all of
that stuff in and look forward to new stuff. We just got the new kind of
special episode just came out. The first proper One Prime Plus episode that
wasn't an extra. So that's in there now for you. You've got some wallpapers and
And more to come.
- Just on the new patron while we're at it,
because I feel like I'm gonna get grilled for this anyway.
Do we want to address the elephant in the room
that even with permission from another podcast co-host,
I kicked the wrong person out?
- Yeah, yeah, a little bit overzealous
in the anti-spam bot fight.
There you were, Martin.
He gave us 15 minutes or so to claim
whether we knew anybody that he was about to delete
from the chat.
Nevermind the fact that we may have been working
or doing other important things with our day.
15 minutes, I haven't heard from you, they're gone.
Unfortunately, one of those people happened to be my mother.
- Sorry, Andrew's mom, we're very grateful for your support.
But look, I'm a little bit keen on quality control.
And apparently these people that I work with here
have lives, I didn't know that.
- It's crazy, not often do I have a life,
but that particular moment I did.
- Sometimes you need human curation,
and this is what you get, you know?
It's fast, it's efficient, but there are mistakes and that just that can happen.
So now something else just to show the difference, I suppose, in the co-hosts here, Andrew, and the
different approach we had to birthdays before I even had a chance to give you my rather is a
backhanded spiteful, I don't know, birthday gift, my birthday gift to you rather than balloons and
doughnut that you couldn't eat was I wasn't going to skip over your sked pal entry in the show notes.
Do you want to talk about that? I was actually going to let you speak about it.
I was I was kind of hoping that this whole birthday charade that I did was gonna get us out of that but
Thanks. No, no
I've made notes and everything. You know, what might get us out of it though
Unannounced trivia corner. I think that might get us out of it. Really
Who's ready for unannounced trivia corner birthday edition?
All right question number one
What year was Windows 1.0 released? Is it 1984, 1985, 1987, or 1999?
I'm gonna go 85.
Martin stole my answer, that's what I was gonna say too.
It's your birthday, you're allowed to double up.
I'm going 85, I seem to remember seeing copyright logos on Windows machines.
That's a horrible thing to have burned into your brain, but okay. Welcome to corporate life
Question two in what year was the Australian dollar and the US dollar?
Roughly one-to-one
Was it 2001?
1991
2010 or 2008
Do you want to go first Andrew? I have an inkling but you go
No, it was when I was over there because I felt like a rich man
Jeez
I was gonna say that I
Was gonna say that too, but for the sake of you know being a good guy for the birthday, man
I'll say 2008 or 2008 is the cool kid. So that's okay. I just remember is that the ABC guy?
Is it Alan Kohler? What's his name? I just remember hearing the word parity over and over again. Everyone was very excited
Right, there's a couple I love economics. I love Alan Kohler and I love parody. All right
Thank you for playing unannounced trivia corner. You net now may proceed with
Sketch dude sketch sketch guy what whatever it's called sked schedule a man
All right, so sked pad now Jason's been teasing me. He calls it something different every time
I mention it to him never by its proper name, but sked pad it is I think it is is it sked pal?
No, I'm pretty sure it's skedpal. See, there's a pal in front of me. Already. We have no idea what it's called because they call it something different every single time.
It's a great app! It's skedpal! It's your friend. It's your scheduling friend. Look, I typed it in my notes as skedpal. That's Jason Burke. Surreptitious influence on me. Skedpal! He's my friend.
Okay, I want to go back to OmniFocus 4 though before I talk about skedpal.
OmniFocus is my like first love so I
Was into OmniFocus before it was OmniFocus when it was just a series of Apple scripts running an Omni outliner
that Ethan Scunova
developed
it's going way back in time and
OmniFocus then came along I was a user of the beta version like version not point one not one yet
And I've been on its train ever since. I love it. I love it. It's the best thing
I've ever used for managing my life. I've tried a few different other things
before it. Nothing stuck and I became like GTD guy. Massive, massive GTD guy. And
even though I'm not hardcore GTD like with all the... I still use like Context
but there were more tags now and stuff. But I could sit you down and have a GTD
conversations for like ever probably bore you to death but I knew it inside
out like I was... We're talking about getting things done not some condition
you were diagnosed with. That's right yeah David Allen yeah but the thing about
OmniFocus is it's like it's like a really comfy doona or something that
you know you you have loved and you know it and it's but it's getting a bit worn
out and it's probably not giving you that same warmth and comfort protection
because it's worn down. OmniFocus is a bit like that with me. It's not driving me forward
in the way that it used to. They're up to like beta 4 for iOS now, so there's still
version 3 on the Mac, moving to 4 on iOS. But it's still the same thing, like you could
go back to version 1 and still use it. There's not really been a whole bunch of additive
stuff and you can say that's good right it's good software platform it does what it needs
to do and that's it but for me at the same time it's it hasn't moved forward right and
it doesn't look like it's going to move forward and so it's not helping me as much as it used
to anymore it does help me with planning like still excellent at like all right this is
a project plan of work I have to do here's all the things but when it comes to following
it. It's like I look at it and I go, "Eh, I could do that, but what else is there on my list? What
other perspective can I bring up and that will give me another option of something that I might
want to do?" And most of the time I just ignore everything and procrastinate. So it's not helping
me work. Do you think this is your fault though? Or the fault of the app in the sense that the app
has become it's hit a tipping point of becoming a Microsoft Word where everyone
uses it and relies on it so therefore it is now stuck in a limbo of I have to now
continue pleasing all of these people that have kind of been using it forever
so now I can't really do anything crazy and wild right like Word is I feel like
kind of a similar thing where it's the same app. You could use Word, you know, 95 or whatever,
but you're not going to get a drastically new Word. Word doesn't suddenly only work in Markdown
now because Markdown is the hot thing, right? Like it's always going to be Word. Or is it more
maybe just that you're, you know, like a lot of people are in the like, I want new stuff as a way
to kind of trick myself into, you know, doing stuff because it's kind of a...
It's like a game almost. And I'm not saying that negatively towards you.
I'm much the same way sometimes where I'm like, "Ah! I just want like a new...
I want a new way to look at this stupid information of things that I don't want to do."
Yeah. I want a new level. I want to be the new boss. Yeah. No, that makes sense.
And and I probably do need that stimulus of new a bit more than like it'd be up because I've been using it for so long
I know what inside out and it's like yeah, this there's nothing new for me to learn. I know it so well
But yeah, they do have that problem that so many people use it and they use it in different ways
So they don't want to upset anybody
But my worry is you look at things that they've been developing over the last couple of years
It's been like all the omni automation stuff
It's so edge case and it's like that's not really helping the majority of people
I would consider myself a power user or omni focus. That's not really helping me
I don't want to spend my time use my time developing code
Even if I could I don't know if I could to do stuff like you're the developer make it for me
And I'll give you money like
Don't don't worry about automation stuff when they still haven't got things like natural language
parsing and that kind of stuff. Like why can't it's really limited in that regard.
So yeah I just it just what basically it's great app I still use it you know
and I think I'll still always have a place for it but for the daily doing
it's not it's not hitting the for me anymore. And so I went on a big journey
of discovery and I found skedpal which is a bad name for a piece of software I
admit it and if you look on the website it looks terrible and they're still
promoting version 2 even though they're the hardcore working on version 3 which
is totally different. The one they're working on looks way better but
still isn't ideal. It's structured basically that all the premise I get
the premise is that you give it your tasks and it creates a plan for your
next couple of weeks that will make sure you do everything if you follow its plan.
So it automatically populates your diary and says like well you said it would take three hours to do this task and
I've broken it across three one hour blocks over the next two weeks
And if you follow that it'll be done by the due date and it does that for everything that you feed it
But it also synchronizes with like your regular calendar so that if you have events and bookings in your calendar
it doesn't overlap those it puts those as priority number one they're like your
fixed meetings and so it bubbles your tasks around it. It has an amazing amount
of customizability in terms of what you can do and how you can set up you can
say I want a minimum block of an hour and I want buffer times before and after
things or not. It's pretty intense and that's probably part of its downfall is
is that the actual data entry port of it,
when you're trying to figure this out,
is a bit clumsy still.
I have hope that they'll continue to improve it,
but I think the very nature of what it's trying to be,
there's always gonna be a level of complexity.
So I'm kind of finding myself at the moment,
I'm still sort of planning in OmniFocus
for like long-term things,
but then taking those plans,
copying and pasting them basically into SchedPal,
to actually then say, right, Andrew,
today you're gonna do these things.
And it takes away like my thinking around that.
It's like, I have just got this menu of things I have to do.
I know if I do them, I'll get everything done.
And it's quite liberating.
It's really interesting.
It's a fun, it's fun.
Like I said, I'm on the beta,
but I paid for the version two that I'm not using.
I bought an annual subscription
just to sort of throw some support at it.
'Cause it doesn't have a huge user base, I don't think.
But I think it's really cool.
It's really interesting.
I encourage anybody to try it, but honestly, do your best to just send them an email.
The developer is super responsive.
So send them an email and just say like, "I want to try it, but I don't want to try version
two.
I want to try version three."
Give it a go.
I'd be curious to know how people feel about it, if they're Uber-like kind of productivity
people like me, and find out what they think.
What do you guys think?
Like Jason does all his time, or did do all his time tracking.
I'm wondering, he's a man of leisure these days, but is it something for you?
Martin, you're trying to write a doctorate and do job and you need some skid pal in your
life.
I think it sounds interesting.
It sounds more like it replaces your calendar than OmniFocus, unless I'm not quite fully
getting what it is.
If I had like Fantastical and OmniFocus, it sounds more like I would use this alongside
OmniFocus versus this alongside Fantastical, maybe.
Yeah, it's kind of like if you would drag in, like, because in, for instance, you could
drag a task from OmniFocus into Fantastical, which is almost like a manual version of what
this software does.
It gets your calendar, it gets your tasks, and it mushes them together in a calendar
view.
Yeah, I mean, I think it I like the idea of how it breaks stuff up
I guess if it were if it's if it's something that's you know
Smart and actually can learn as you do things like I never put
XYZ on a Friday
like if it just kind of knows stuff like that because it at the end of the day if it just breaks it up into
Three blocks and throws it wherever it fits
For me, I'm probably gonna be like, I don't like where you put that. I want this to actually be over there
or whatever. So I don't know if it's too hands-on for me where it's like now it's...
And I can see the value of it being kind of an assistant for you if that's what you want.
I don't... yeah, I don't know. I like the idea of it. I don't think currently in my day-to-day
it would make any sense at all. It does have like this idea of time maps. So you can say like,
I want you know like so I've blocked out green time at certain times and called
that my working day and then I've got like leisure times which are kind of
like green in the evenings and kind of orange make schedule if you have to
kind of in the late afternoon so you can do that kind of thing about like don't
give me anything on a Friday because that's like and it will respect that so
it's kind of clever like that in terms of mobile apps it's got one it's in it
It has an Android app, I have no idea what that's like.
Actually I do think I know what it's like, because I think it's exactly like the iOS
version, which is a bit of a disappointment.
It's in test flight.
It has the rudimentary stuff, but it's definitely still a work in progress.
And it has that sort of Google-y material design kind of ethos to it, so I hate it.
But it does enough to just have a glance at it and go "ah, that's what I have to do".
but I don't use it for much beyond that.
- Now, say you say that there's a level of intensity
in managing it, that is maybe a bit too much,
but am I right in saying that that's kind of also
what you enjoy about it?
- (laughs) You see right through me.
Yeah, I do like that.
I like fiddling and tweaking.
I'm on a learning curve with it as well,
and I'm kind of figuring out how it works.
It takes a lot of learning, I would say.
This is not for the faint of heart,
but yeah, I do like that fiddliness of it.
It's like a new toy. It is a new toy for me.
Right. See, to answer your question for me, if you were to ask anyone in my close circle of
family or friends, actually anyone who's ever met me for five minutes, they probably know that I want
to be in control of my day and run things and I like technology and all of that stuff. So when you
say that you like using an app like this and that it has that level of intensity in your managing
stuff, I totally appreciate it. I can see why you like it. For me, that's the kind of cut off for
for where I'm interested in technology where I like manipulating things on a screen or
doing things to do with computing but the moment that I'm having to manage the tool
that's managing me I lose all interest. Perfect example, this isn't really your skedpal thing
but I was trying this app called Spendy which was all about your own financial management.
It was like tracking just in a basic way the things that you pay for and I recommended
it to my sister and she has become such a massive fan of it. She had her spendyversary
recently. I was like, "Congratulations! You've had your spendyversary!" We were laughing
because I left that app like five minutes after I recommended it to her because it drove
me nuts having to remember to manually add the $4.50 that I spent on this particular
Sydney coffee after I bought it. That's my life, Martin! That's what I do
in YNAB every day. It brings joy! It drives me nuts. I know, I know. And I'm
I'm glad that it works for you, but for me it's just
That precious moment that I could have been sipping the coffee when it was hot, but instead I'm going where did that $4.50 go?
Oh now it's the purple category. You know just not for me, so scared pal all power to you power to you
Stay on top of that because it's a pain in the ass if you got to reconcile later, and you haven't entered transactions
Just ask me just ask my wife
Constantly like going in and backfilling her transactions because she's not Andrew's YNAB
Code will be in the show notes. I'm sure for a referral our referral totally totally
I'll be trying to sell one of codes for like the last three years. I think I've had one taker
And I'm putting that in. Oh, anyway, I'm scared pal power to you Andrew get it get it. Yeah, join me in the slack
Skip house like yep
Have you heard of obsidian
They don't they don't use it. They don't use slack or discord. They use an IRC because it's nice plain text
Have you guys heard of WWDC is that a is that a thing that's ever come across your desk
Yeah, I think I watched it recently. I had
Not much to really say about it. Not that it was
Not you know, it was not that it was uneventful or boring or anything. I just I think it's too early to really
Everybody already knows everything that's happened. First of all, everyone watched it
Everyone's probably heard a million different shows and things about it and blog posts, whatever
rather whether it's praising it or you know doing what tech blogs usually do and
You know doing what they do
I
Just think it's too early to really say anything about it. I don't think we really know what is actually gonna be happening
We don't know what new hardware is happening this year, which is always, you know, they tell us about the software
They tell us most of what it is, but then there's usually a hardware thing that gets enabled by a software thing
we don't know about so it's like I
Don't know
but I just was curious if you guys if there was like one or two or ten things that came out of
WWDC this year that were
exciting and or you're hopeful for and I don't think either of you are covering the beta or ever would want to
But yeah, what do you... thoughts or otherwise?
Praise? Hate? Anything?
I have thoughts about the presentation and also releases or announcements
Maybe I'll do the releases and announcements first
The thing that really caught my attention was the iPadOS multitasking
Just because even though I spend most of my time on a Mac
There are those times, particularly when I'm doing some long-form writing
writing or you know just anyone who's ever done like a split view situation
and then has multiple windows running in different places I think it's just not
that nice that they're surfacing that functionality a little bit more and when
I saw that feature where you could swipe to the side and reveal the home screen
to bring up apps from behind that to me just went okay cool thank you this is
one of the most functional changes that has been brought and obviously you have
to be kind of into using the iPad to really benefit from that, but that was something
that I was particularly hopeful for in watching the presentation.
That being said, and like you said Jason I don't want to rant about this forever because
everyone's already had their, you know, two cents worth about this, I kind of felt like
the communication could have been a little bit better in this presentation, and I know
that might sound a little bit ridiculous because we're talking about master communicators,
Apple, who can market just about anything. It was more about features sprawled across
all systems and was there really a narrative and I kind of felt like it was one, and I kind of
thought this about the first recorded one that they did last year, it felt like one never-ending
and now on to you infomercial, constantly looking over shoulders to the next person. And you know,
granted in Australia on the east coast I'm watching it at three o'clock in the morning
and I'm half asleep so maybe this is my fault but in the past not to go too far back into the
"oh when Steve Jobs was doing it" thing there was a dramatic pause or there were silences and there
were breaths between sentences. Things are so densely packed now and features so sprawled
across the symptom, not symptoms, across the systems and it's just such breakneck speed that
that by the time it got to the end of the presentation, I thought,
what was I excited about again?
So I think there was a lot of cool stuff to see.
And I'm not bagging out the company for its efforts and what it's put out.
To me, it was just such a hyper fast, infomercial breakneck
speed presentation that in my half sleepy delirium,
I really had to concentrate.
I think that makes sense.
I think I feel like a lot of that comes from just Internet culture
now in general where everything has to be fast fast fast now now now versus
taking time to just you know take it in and understand what's going on. I feel
like you probably you probably lose a lot of that too just by the nature of it
not being live where even though there always is a schedule when it's alive you
still have that I mean like the sked pal thing we're just talking about
There's still that human piece that can take that extra half second or you know
Wait for you know, if something's happening or there's just there's a little more nuance to it
I think when it's live and I would
Imagine if these were alive, I think they'd still be go go go fast fast fast
But I think a lot of it gets lost in the excitement of how much you can edit it to be like a cool movie
Versus it being a presentation
That's what it felt like to me. I totally get what you're saying where it's like
What even that was like a hundred things you just mentioned and there were 200 more on a slide at the end that we didn't even
get to
And yeah, I think a lot of it too is just there's a lot of crap now
and I think I I think we lose sight of that often where
There's just so much stuff that has to happen all at once now where it used to be this was this year
This was that year now. It's it's it's expected that everything get this massive
Crazy upgrade every single time or else everybody's upset
Which is funny because even when it gets the massive upgrade everyone's still upset
so it's like you can't make anyone happy with any of this stuff it seems but
I
Seemed and I will say sorry to interrupt
I really really enjoyed having the discord component with all of our listeners on the WWDC channel because even though I've never been
in an audience for an Apple keynote
Like you said that live nuanced element of reactions in a crowd because that's not in there anymore
For better or worse having that in just this nice little thread that I could look in and out and go
Oh, that's what people think that's cool. I thought that was a nice enhancement
So thanks to listeners who actually came along the ride for that. Yeah, I agree
I think that that really makes it a much better experience having some kind of live component
with people. Yeah, whether that's somebody sitting next to you or even just the Discord
chat. I thought that was great. Jason, you asked the question, we need to give one favorite thing
each from the keynote. And the Discord chat was my one favorite thing. I've never done that before.
I've never watched, I've always been alone watching those and that was the first time
I've had the experience to like sit with people that I feel like, not Twitter
because Twitter is too overwhelming, but people that I sort of am connected to in
some way and talking about something that we're all watching together. It was
really fun. It's one of the things I've often heard, you know, podcasting
superstars talk about doing and never had that same experience myself and this
This was the first for me and I really enjoyed it.
And it was funny that I went back, actually with the Discord as well, I thought it was
hilarious.
I think I made a comment halfway through it, it was like, "Oh my God, me and Martin are
like totally culturally different here."
Because we were doing the Australian thing of just taking the piss out of everything.
Like, yeah, just like criticizing it every turn.
But like-
It's my default setting.
In like, kind of like, "Well, why not?
That's kind of what you do."
And it was a real eye-opening thing for me because that's what everybody does in Australia.
That's just how you, that's the way you deal with those circumstances.
But you, like Jason and a couple of others, were much more like genuine, like trying to
find a genuine positives in it.
And I suddenly looked at what we're writing and we just sound like negative Nazis.
So I was a bit, sort of thinking about it, and it was in the middle of the night as well,
So, you know, faculties weren't running at full speed.
But I hope that didn't impact other people negatively, because I think that's just an
honest cultural thing that me and Martin were just like, "Oh yeah, you're like, you know,
stupid, whatever, stupid, stupid."
I can't remember.
I think I'm worse than you are though, Andrew, because every time someone comes out and says,
like particularly when they say in the scripting, "Oh, you know, my photos," and like, "They're
not your photos.
They were planted there.
Please don't say my."
It's just this hyper positive. This is amazing. I'm like just just dial it back. All right, it's impressive just
God from that when I was thinking okay. So what was my favorite thing? I liked about it. I
Couldn't remember anything. I
Was like I went back and had to look at I went
Trolling blog sites to try and figure out what the hell they announced and what did I actually like and I didn't actually find anything
And I think I think maybe then my like is that maybe this is like a modern snow leopard
It's just kind of like improvements. I knew somebody was gonna say that. I'm sorry. I knew it. I'm sorry. I knew it
The the one thing they didn't fix I didn't mention that they're fixing that needs fixing is the Mac OS notification dismissal
Like you got to aim at that little X on the Mac OS to get rid of the little
Notification things in the top corner
It's a real pain in the butt and I didn't fix that you got to hover over it
It's where the X doesn't appear until you hover over it and then click on it and then it kind of oh
And then oh you miss it and then you click on notification
Martin mentioned the multitasking on iPad OS, which is funny because I actually so I recently switched from
The 11-inch iPad to the 13-inch iPad
And what I'm using the 13-inch iPad, correct? Yep
to go alongside my, you know, MacBook Pro 15.4. No, it's the MacBook Pro 15. Anyway,
I went to actually set up multitasking on that iPad using the previous iOS, iOS 14.
I couldn't remember how to do it. I never remember how to do it because I wanted to have the, I think
I wanted like my notes on one side and maybe the Discord on the other side. Or no, I had micro.blog
on the left and the discord on the right so I could kind of see both. Couldn't for the
life of me remember how the hell to even do multitasking to get two windows on the same
damn screen. So that was already, I was like, this should probably get updated with iOS
15. That would be good. I did figure it out. Yes, it's doable. It's fine. It's just how
do you know how to do it? I have no idea. I don't think most people probably ever use
it because they don't know how. And then don't even get me started on now there's
like this floaty window that kind of goes on one side or the other I don't
know. Anyway, so I'm using this iPad now as a you know as my mobile computer
alongside the iMac and so I put iOS 15 on that beta 1. It's so much nicer now
where you get the little three dot things you know where to click stuff
Grabbing apps from the little app drawer thing is great.
I love that there's an app drawer now.
I think, I like it on the phone
'cause there's just so much crap that I know the,
what are those things called?
Not AirTags, the little clip, clips?
Gosh, I don't, app clips, is that what it is?
Where you're like, you don't need the app.
I feel like that is meant to solve the problem
that I have of like all of these apps
that I have on my phone as a,
oh, on the off chance I need to park
in this one specific city, I have that app for that.
And it's like, I don't want those,
but the app drawer on the phone was great
'cause it's like, good,
just throw it in the stupid junk drawer.
If you need it, search for it.
If you don't, don't be bothered with it.
So I've always liked the app drawer.
I think it's good on the iPad.
Having the widgets everywhere on the screen is great.
It's like kind of a mix between dashboard and a desktop.
I think that'd be cool to have on the Mac, honestly,
to have those widgets just on my screen all the time.
I don't know what that would do to the system
if all that crap was running all the time,
but I think that might be kind of cool.
So I guess I would pick iPad just in general
as it feels like it got a pretty good bump.
I've been using the iOS also, the iOS.
90.
IOS 15 and it's been mostly fine.
And I think the Safari is probably the biggest.
Why do I keep saying the Safari?
I think Safari has been probably the biggest kind of knee jerk reaction of like, whoa,
this is wow.
This is crazy different.
Everything about it's different.
The bar is no longer in the same spot.
the top looks different. I think it's the movement of the bar is the only thing
that kind of throws me off. I love the way that things bleed to the edge. I do
have one I have one criticism I just thought of so I'll put on my Australia
hat and be mean. The one thing that I would love to see WWDC do is be boring
again in the sense that, and this is the nature of, you know, whatever Apple biggest trillion,
billion, gajillion dollar, whatever. Everything has to be like customer focused now and like has
to excite all the stupid news outlets and everything. So people get clicks and whatever,
but like WWDC, it just, it felt like a September iPhone event again, where it was just very much
like, "Hey consumers, here's all the consumery consumer consumer consumer."
And I want more boring, like, "Hey, here's a new feature and it does this by doing a
neural engine call to the..."
Even if I don't understand what half of the shit is, it just felt like they're talking
to the person at the Apple store who's trying to decide what iOS they're going to buy instead
of a developer and I'm not a developer so I'm sure there was a lot of that
stuff later but the keynote just felt like it was a hundred percent here you
go CNET or whoever's a relevant tech thing now you know write up ten articles
about why the new and it's not even available which is so annoying because
it felt like it was a hundred percent consumer focused but they're not even
Gonna see it for four months or whatever. So I think if it were more boring, I actually would would like that
Yeah, I didn't read a lot of the stuff about it and after the event
I watched the event and that kind of turned it off because I'm not gonna install any of this stuff and anything I read about
It now I'm gonna forget so I'll just wait until it comes out explore and then it's gonna change. Yeah
Yeah, whatever they say today is not gonna be the same by beta 7 or whatever, right?
So it's like it kind of doesn't matter
It's almost just a waste of energy, but yet everyone has to do it because we got to do the the clicky click machine, right?
Yeah, like that thing where the mouse went between like 15 devices
Holy crap, that was amazing. I don't know what that has to do with being a developer though, right?
Like that's completely an end-user
Benefit, I guess if you're a developer that wants to develop across three Macs at the same time
Maybe but I don't know. I just I I'm not saying I don't enjoy it
It's just like it didn't really feel like a developer
Thing it felt like this was put out
For you know, this was this could you could have just announced the new iPhone at the end in September
And this would have been the iPhone event. Honestly, I don't know how it really differed from that
Which makes me wonder what are they gonna have for two hours at an iPhone event if we already know about all is it?
all this stuff again? I don't know. Yeah, that's what they do. They reiterate.
So that was our quick run-through of WWDC, each with our one single item of things
that we liked from it. Martin was the only one who followed the brief. Me and
Jason rattled on far too much. Surprise!
[Music]
Right, well I have a story to share. Changing gears now. I bought a new iPod.
It's 2004! Wait, how do you buy a new iPod? How does that work?
Recently on Twitter I came across a wonderful nostalgic image. If you're familiar with the Twitter account Infinite Loop,
it was I think the iPod 4th generation, which was now retroactively or retrospectively referred to as the classic.
It's before it went to the photo model. We're talking Chicago font, right?
and I just retweeted the image, quoted it saying "seriously nostalgic"
and the two hosts of a podcast that I follow called The Cinematologists
came out of the woodwork, their names are Dario and Neil
and we had this great discussion on Twitter about the nostalgia of the iPod
and something that came out of that discussion was that at least one of them
still carries around an iPod classic with their own digital music files on it
files on it and that they wouldn't be parted with it. It's like it's just this satisfying
feeling of walking around with the music that you own on a dedicated device and I thought
that's kind of interesting that that's that's really kind of a novel concept these days this
this new idea of walking around with music that you own rather than it being simply a streaming
service or as Apple promised with the Apple Music launch a number of years ago the stuff you own
mixed with the stuff that you stream and now kind of just murky and it's really just all of our
library right and I thought well sometimes I've actually gone and put
music onto an old iPod like one of the ones on my shelf that I'm looking at
right now and just walked around to see what it's like and I thought but I don't
actually have a device that I walk around with that has all of my music on
it so I went on the eBay and I started scrolling away and what I found is
there's this guy in guess where Western Australia who customizes them and will
sell it to you as this, I'm calling it, new iPod. So I got this, right? This is a black iPod video,
this is before they went to the classic moniker, this is the glossy one. Now this was originally a
30 gigabyte model. What this wonderful gentleman in Western Australia has done is not only replaced
the battery, he has put a new click wheel on it and replaced the 30 gigabyte hard drive with a 128
gig SD card. So it's essentially brought into the future, kind of. And on the back, as far as I can
tell, it also has - I don't know if you can see there, if it's easy - 128 gig has been put on the
back along with a revised version of the serial number. But yeah, I just wanted to briefly touch
on this experience. It has been fantastic to go back to the hard drive that I stored my entire
music library on pre-Apple Music. I did that preemptively because I was worried about what
streaming would do to it. And on a separate older Mac I've just, you know, connected this,
put it all on there, taken it for walks, took it for a walk while using my DSLR, you know,
splitting the music and photo device that is now just within the phone, and even taken it
in the car to listen to music plugged into the auxiliary jack, so much so that Natasha is now
trying to look for her old iPod Shuffle. So look, for any of our One Prime pros--
One plus one prime plus subscribers who have seen in my
my additions to the newsletter about my kind of
Nostalgic trips with the iPod hi-fi and the and the Canon lens and everything. I don't know
I'm just on a real nostalgic trip recently and I thought I'd share that I'd time-traveled back a little bit. That's cool, though
I like that the thing of the thing I wish that I've seen people do these like little iPod mods
I think it'd be really cool if they put Bluetooth in it
Like I know it's the whole like analog plug-in headphones or whatever like I I just I don't like the cord thing because it always gets
Hung up on something and then rips headphones out of my head, but I think it'd be cool if they put Bluetooth in there
as well
How does it go with spatial audio?
spatial audio that's a
Can of worms I'm sorry. I have to apologize
I have to apologize to both of you and listeners won't necessarily know this but I went on a bit of
of a, not a rant, but kind of like a panicked meltdown into what the implications of spatial
audio were after I heard one song. And I was very, very, very worried.
I can believe that. I can believe that Martin would get quite upset about spatial audio,
the changing the integrity of the original recording. I can see him getting quite worked
up about it.
Until I worked out that you could go to the settings and turn it off, Crowded Houses Don't
Dream It's Over was butchered. It was absolutely butchered.
Media Corner. So I have a podcast by Martin's favorite broadcaster the ABC
It's not a new podcast, but it's one that was new to me. It's called the 11th
This is a podcast detailing the full story behind the dismissal of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam
by the Governor-General on 11th of November
1975
So it was before all of our births
But nevertheless, it was probably the most monumental
day in Australian political history. May well we say
God save the coin because nobody will save the Governor-General
Perfect. Whatever I stuffed that up. I think you did a pretty good job of that actually
For the non Australians and maybe the Australians among us
Goff was a Prime Minister of Australia
Who lasted he was there for?
He was there for a short time and kind of a good time. He worked hard, but there was a
and the government was quite... how would you say? They were ahead of their time.
I think it would probably be fair to say looking back on it now, Australia was
still a very conservative society and they had some modern ideas and they were
trying to implement these and it didn't go quite down so well with the
establishment. And what basically ended up happening was the Queen's
representative, who is the head of our monarchy, our constitutional... help me
out Martin because I'm losing my words. Yeah constitutional monarchy that's it. Thank you.
The Queen's representative, the Governor General is actually at the top of the tree but in
reality the Prime Minister is the elected representative and the Governor General should
only ever listen and then do as requested. He doesn't actually have any, he doesn't,
he shouldn't ever exercise any of the powers which are vested in him. But on this day he
chose to go against that convention and sack the Prime Minister.
Some might say a bit of a non-democratic choice of moves.
But this podcast goes into great detail about what led up to that day and sort of fills
you in.
Because for me, I'm a bit of a political junkie, but there was so much about it that I still
didn't really understand.
It was like a long time ago.
This podcast, really good and really interesting.
I went smash through it so fast.
I couldn't stop listening to it.
Really good.
I think it's like eight episodes maybe?
Forty odd minutes.
Go for it.
I didn't even put it on fast speed.
I listened to it at like normal speed.
I was that invested in it.
The 11th.
The game that is called It Takes Two.
It is kind of a depressing game, I would say.
The premise of the game is there's this little girl, her parents are basically getting a
divorce.
She's really sad about it.
She made two little dolls of them out of just random clay and fabric and crap.
I don't think I'm spoiling anything.
Magic things happen.
These two things come to life.
So it's a co-op game by design.
It has to be.
And now the two characters are you and someone else.
And you have to go through this world and you're trying to fix stuff in life.
But now you're these little characters, so you're in real-world environments that are
gigantic compared to you.
and sooze and you now have to go through and basically complete tasks with each
other to be able to move on to the next area. So you'll have to hold something
down so someone else can jump on it to get to the next thing, then you have to
you know shoot something else to make it come down so they can get up a ramp, that
kind of thing. But it it's called It Takes Two because it actually does and
you have to play it co-op with someone to advance through all the levels. So the
The story is not uplifting, really.
I mean, at the end, I'm sure it's going to be, I hope.
We haven't finished it yet,
but the mechanic is really cool in the sense
that it's this forced co-op scenario by design.
It's not just, oh, play it with someone else if you want.
You have to.
- So would you say it takes too long?
- No, I'm actually quite enjoying it.
We've played, I think, four sessions of it now,
probably for a total of maybe an hour and a half each time.
And I'm not sure how much is left,
but it hasn't gotten to the point where I'm like done with it.
I want to keep playing it.
Okay, cool. So you're pushing on despite the somewhat depressing premise.
Yeah. And that like there, there was,
I'm not going to say what it was cause spoilers,
but there was one part where I was like,
I was physically upset from what was happening in the game.
It was just like, that's a little bit much, but yeah.
It's an emotional game, so strap in.
(upbeat music)
- This suggestion is very Australian,
probably equally, if not more Australian
than Andrew's, the dismissal suggestion.
So I apologize, but let's consider it
an educational experience and a chance to make fun of me.
For any Australians listening, there was a fantastic,
and I mean really fantastic comedy show
the 90s called Fast Forward, right? And we're talking really, really crazy sketch comedy
where the premise was, and you know, this could be the whole Media Corner suggestion
itself and I'm going to talk about a particular sketch. The style of the show was such that
it was almost like a crazy VHS tape where you started a sketch and then something would
sort of fast forward or rewind and then you'd suddenly end up at another sketch, but then
they would revisit previous sketches over and over again like you were constantly fast
forwarding and rewinding the tape. Kind of static effect right. Now I love
lots of sketches in this show right and I'm not even necessarily saying that
this is the funniest one but I bring it up because it's the one that Natasha
uses to make fun of me right. So there's a news presenter or there was a news
presenter on Australian television called Yana Vent and in actual history
on the show I think it was a current affair I think it was anyway whatever it
was she interviewed a former Queensland state premier,
kind of like the equivalent of a US governor,
Sir Joe Belkey-Peterson.
And he was kind of like a bit of a loose cannon,
constantly accused of corruption
and all of this horrible stuff.
And they do this parody of this interview
between Yana and Sir Joe.
And Yana is played by this deadpan actress on the show,
people who know the show recognize her,
and she's just always kind of delivering the lines
this like "have you ever taken a bribe Sir Joe?" and Natasha claims that I speak
exactly like Sir Joe on my long white male rants about what should have taken
only three or four syllables to actually answer and he constantly goes on about
"oh and you are putting the words in my mouth and you are wrong" and so on and if
you watch this you will get to the end of it particularly if you're not from
Australia and go "what the hell did I just watch?" if you know me or you've
listen to the podcast you'll go "yeah Martin kind of rambles a bit like that".
So anyway look in the show notes there'll be a link to Yarn Event
interviewing Sir Joe "Bjelke" Peterson parody version from Fast Forward and
then you can go down the YouTube rabbit hole and enjoy other skits from this
fine TV program.
Natasha just burst into the room and said "I heard what you were
talking about Martin and you didn't do the impersonation of yourself properly".
Are you coming in to do it?
Well you've put the pressure on yourself.
Now you've put the pressure on yourself and all you must outperform on the podcast
Otherwise it is not very good for our listeners
Andrew's doubled over. He said it's like there were two of us
Bloody hell. Anyway, that's the sketch
Andrew thinks that's good. Thank you. See ya. See you Natasha. Thanks for interrupting
(upbeat music)
