Speaking of home desk photo we've got one more submission and Vincent certainly wins the prize for the neatest most photogenic desk this puts me in a Zen mood just looking at it.
So what I really want to know on this is when you gonna send us your actual desk photo like it's nice that you send us this little magazine spread.
And you know, it looks good in the magazine, everybody appreciates it.
But like, where's the actual desk photo?
Because there's no way this is it.
It's just, it's just too nice.
I can't deal with it.
It's too perfect.
The minimalist quality of it is, is, oh, it just makes me so happy and angry at the same time.
It's too good.
Can I just say, aside from the beautiful minimalism, I feel like I need to ask about why there is basil pesto spaghetti in a pot plant in the middle of an instrumental triangle.
I don't understand this.
I thought that was his pool cue rack thing, you know, setting up the.
Oh, that's right.
But like miniature pool.
It is a lamp, right?
I think it's a lamp.
It's.
Oh, the lamp's coming over the top.
It's like, yeah, it's like bent into a triangle and then it kind of comes around.
It's like a giant paperclip bent into a lamp shape
Yes, my goodness
And if you look at the desk at the at the bottom or where I assume
He sits if he does in fact use this very beautifully presented desk
It looks like it might be the handle for a drawer
But at the same time it looks like it might be some sort of dr
Evil or mr. Burn style button that ejects whoever's visiting that is what I wanted to know
I wanted to know what is the giant secret not-so-secret button
Do I thought exactly the same thing I think it's a James Bond evil villain button doors open shark tank.
I assumed that that button somehow triggered some kind of script that made the desk super clean.
So that whenever somebody came by you just go bam hit the button everything flips over and it's just like a nice presentable you know brand new looking MacBook Pro with nothing in the dock and no icons on the screen.
Just ready to go. It's like an insta clean button because
Man, it's just and then even around the desk is like everything's nice. It's just there's no children
It's no children in this family is there
No, but you know why he's able to keep it so clean and minimalist because all of his attention is focused other than on the
Computer on that fidget cube to the left. Yeah, you said that. Yep. Yep. Yep, and
And they are good fun. I know my sister had one of those because she was a massive fidgeter
So she tried to fidget with that but then just went back to fidgeting with pens and random
Stationery and twiddling hair and so on so I'm not sure I mean Vincent if you can tell us how effective that is and helping you
Concentrate that would be very interesting is super. It has like so many different things on it. We have one of those
For my son. Yeah, we got I actually bought two of them
They're quite good, but a bit too small for my hand. So I found it a bit uncomfortable
But he he likes him, but yeah, the little buttons that little thing on the top is like a joystick thing
Swings around it's got some switches
So, what do we think about the fact that the computer is not centered on the desk it's a little alarming but
I'm so distracted by everything else. That's not there that it kind of fades away
It is squared on the desk
pretty nicely
I'm a little concerned about the command key on the left and I don't know if it's just like a weird light reflection or
Zoom in something happened
But it looks like something may have gotten
Damaged on the command key and I'm worried about that. But I'm looks a bit like a shark fin when you zoom all the way
Yeah, yeah
I don't know if it's just a weird light thing or what but there is that to be concerned that must be a butterfly keyboard
It looks like it's probably a 15 inch... yeah probably.
20...
Yeah you can see from the arrow key layer.
It probably stuck.
It probably got stuck one day and he just got angry with it and smashed his entire finger
through the command keys.
He actually cracked open to get to the switch mechanism.
You know what?
I think I've figured out why his desk looks this way and why it's so tidy.
I think I've worked out why it is the way it is, this desk.
I think his lounge room is a startup incubation hub, and he is the receptionist for his own
lounge room.
Because I can imagine walking in to this room, Vincent's sitting to the side and says, "Oh,
hello, we were expecting you."
And then you walk in and you take your place, and he's there overseeing as the friendly
host for his own lounge room.
And if you displease him, surprise, surprise, the button is there, ready to eject you.
I could see that.
That makes a lot of sense.
It does?
He's got the fallout shelter guy.
And is that like a cry for help?
Because that fallout shelter guy is not actually happy, right?
Isn't that kind of the thing with those things?
I assume that was one of those things where it was like a tell, where if you walked into
of the room and the guy was on the corner of the left corner of the desk that means
one thing right if he's on you know the other corner that means something else so it's kind
of a secret language amongst the household that if he's in the top left corner I can't
be bothered right now but if he's put away come on by even the shadows those things are
casting looks beautiful look at it yeah perfect yeah it's actually I have another theory I
I don't think he's a receptionist. I'm wondering now with those minerals on that coaster, if he's some sort of witch doctor.
Could be. I mean, I've used his app and it seems to do amazing things.
So, I mean, I don't know how he does it so quickly.
I think he may be using. You think he's summoning the power of the minerals?
Do you think he would like maybe see people and there's like a couch on the other side and he would place those stones on their chest or something and do the stone therapy and get the essence of people?
Also, do you think the coasters are there year round with the little deer on them?
Or is that a thematic thing where they change out from season to season?
I think it's because winter is coming.
I think that's what it's about.
And okay.
So you mentioned the plant.
I don't know what it is.
We'd love to know what that crazy plan is.
The other thing that came to mind is I'm.
I don't understand.
It's clearly an Apple subwoofer
From the Apple speakers from back in the day off to the right of the desk
Yeah, I was gonna ask about that you zoom in and then it looks like an Apple logo
I think it's a G far right or cube next to it maybe or something kind of tucked behind
the
Yeah, it's like the Harman Kardon. Yeah, you're talking about the Harman Kardon. Yeah
Plastic and then it looks like a cube next. Yeah, I think so
And I'm curious are you using those speakers current? Oh, yeah, actually if you look up there next to the TV
Okay, so if you look at the other angle he provided us two angles, which was very nice
It looks like you've got the the standing speakers up next to the TV. So the subwoofers on the floor
and I think that's a g4 back there g4 cube maybe or I
Don't know what it is. It's hard to tell it kind of has a weird perspective
[MUSIC PLAYING]
What I love is that each of these submissions
includes some interesting Easter eggs.
We've got Craig putting himself into his own photo.
We've got the G4 cube here.
We've got random surface boxes and things hidden around.
There's a lot of effort going into this, I feel.
Thank you, Vincent, for being brave enough
to submit your photo along with Gabriel and Craig.
