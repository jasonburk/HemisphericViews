I shaved my beard last night. Yeah, I liked it better the old way.
Beautiful. Green, green, I mean orange, orange, orange.
Vote one Feldfoot. A vote for the foot is a vote for justice.
The kindest suppression you'll ever experience.
It's true, yeah.
But then there's the little star at the end just to cover a bit, you know, just in case.
Martin Feld crushing politely.
Every one of his statements has a little asterisk next to it,
but it never has the other end to tell you what it means.
Just like those annoying things that you always see where they always put the little one or the
symbol and you're like where's the damn symbol? When you find the asterisk or the one or you go
to the footnote while you're turning the page as he comes up behind it goes "Ahh!"
The knife goes that way. Exactly.
Or you distract him. He can't be trusted.
He just puts stars everywhere. In the foot we trust.
In foot we trust. All the currency is just coins with feet on both sides which makes it impossible
to do a coin flip and he did that on purpose. Foot or foot?
foot. He wins, you lose.
I like the idea of a filled foot currency, actually. That would be good.
I can imagine that.
I actually think that I'd get behind that.
Well, no, what you would have if they were coins, you would have a foot on one side,
you know, the whole head and tail situation. On the other side,
you would see the person who was being crushed underneath the foot.
Gotcha.
I like that.
And that would be you too.
They'd be weighted just so that their face is always down.
And talking about currency, someone's actually decided to spend theirs on our long game.
Who's that?
Would you be talking about oneprimeplus.com by chance?
Absolutely.
Wow.
Well, I hate to break it to you all, but not only did we have a new One Prime Plus edition
last episode, now it's like a trend.
It's a trend if it happens twice, right?
Is that fair to say?
Yes.
I think we're trending.
Well, we're pretty trendy.
So, now we've got, and I'm going to go ahead and pass it to Andrew to actually say the
name so that i don't have to screw it up andrew who is our new one prime plus dot com extraordinary
member i'm so excited you handed it to me because i love this name i don't know if i said it right
but i like saying it in my head now i'm going to say it out loud potty box that's how i imagine it
that's that's exactly in with those inflections that's how i say it's such a fun word potty
Hello, PODDY BOCK. Do we have any idea the meaning behind that or what is-
I reckon- Where that- Yeah, I've got something.
Okay.
So you'll notice that PODDY, PODDY, it's sort of a rearrange.
It could, if you move some letters around, it could be iPOD.
I like that.
Yeah.
Oh, yes.
Right.
So I think- You've got Martin's attention.
So then you've got the BOCK, which is just B-O-Q.
No, no U after the Q, just a hard BOCK.
All right. So I'm going to do the same thing. I'm going to rearrange those.
Show title.
And I'm going to apply the Qantas Airlines rule, which also doesn't have a U after the Q, but it allows it to be Qantas even without the U.
So I'm going to call him iPod Quob.
That works.
Yeah. Okay.
That is something he didn't, they did not expect when joining that their name would be rearranged and given this new light.
But I like it.
So I imagine it backwards, just it's even funnier because then it's
Kwabi-Dop and that just sounds amusing.
Or Bach reminds me of the sound of the letters in Baroque, in which case
rearranging to make iPod would mean that it's an iPod fully just loaded
with Baroque music. Wow.
Oh, wow. I hope he's got that classical bit flipped, you know, so you don't get the
you know, merges the things, you know, there was that that toggle.
You got to be careful.
The track management sort of flow from one to the next.
If you're into baroque music, you don't want hard cuts.
Now, Jason, you're pretty excited because we get to do something kind of called Gaming Corner now.
Yes, because you are a hardcore gamer now.
That's been established.
I just have Dorito dust on my fingers permanently, just wiping it on stuff.
And then Mountain Dew just running through the veins.
Definitely.
Yeah, Gaming Corner is now a thing officially.
And...
Do we need artwork for this now?
I mean, it wouldn't hurt.
Hmm, yeah, okay.
Maybe a tune, a tune wouldn't hurt either.
Wish I could join Gaming Corner.
No, just go down to your local store
and pick up an Xbox Series X.
Sure, okay.
Or a PS5, those are equally available.
Now I derailed you Jason, keep going.
No, I added this sub or title to the notes because you had yet another game
controller in the notes and that makes yet another trend.
So this is like the week of trends.
Episode 60, by the way, which translates to trends.
Uh, you had another gaming controller.
So I thought, well, you did that.
Obviously you're really, really wanting someone else to put gaming corner into
the notes because you couldn't bring yourself to do it.
You didn't want to force that on us,
but I could feel that you wanted it.
So I thought I would let you start off
with your hot gaming tips and news of the week.
- Well, I'm glad that you sold it as hot gaming news
and tips like it's actually relevant to other people.
It was actually just an excuse to tell a stupid story
of mine recently.
- We love stupid stories here.
- Yeah, stupid stories are good.
Yeah, it was a bit of follow-up
just on my Xbox gaming experience.
A while ago, I think I mentioned
that I have these SteelSeries Nimbus Plus controllers.
They're like the made for iPhone ones.
- Yes.
- Still have them, they're great.
You can use them with Apple TV or iPhone or whatever.
And I thought I was using it recently in a context
that when I reflect on it was probably
the nerdiest public display that I've ever given.
- That's a tall order.
- People have no doubt done nerdier things.
I've probably even done nerdier things myself,
but the fact that it was outside of my home on display,
I was a bit more, hmm, yeah.
- Can you give us some context
around what that public environment was like?
It was at a tire shop.
So I'll give you the story.
Right.
I'm not ready.
Yeah.
I drove into work.
Everything was normal because we're kind of, you know, back at the office now, a
bit of a flexible hybrid situation happening.
And I got there, parked the car, went inside, working away, said hello to
colleagues, working away with the team, you know, as you do in the office
environment. And then colleagues walked past and went, Martin,
you've got a flat tire. What's the deal?
And I went, what are you talking about?
And they said, you have a flat tire.
I'm like, do I? And they said, didn't you know? And I'm like, I have no idea. So what's
happened is someone's walked down the hill of the car park past my passenger side where
I didn't see that I had a flat tyre and I've just walked into the building completely ignorant.
And they've done like a, not a company wide email, but one around the building. And it
happened to be an email group that I wasn't part of. All these people in the building
know about Martin's flat tyre except for him. So I look like a bit of a bit of a goober.
Two of my wonderful team members helped me change my tire,
did it up on the jack and everything,
discovered that there's all these wonderful tools
in my boot or trunk.
- Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
Do you not know how to change a tire?
- I know roughly what the process is,
but I had never actually needed to do it before.
So they said, we'll help you.
And I went, okay, sure.
So.
- That's the one mechanical thing I can do.
(laughing)
- That's the one thing you know how to do.
- I know how to do that.
That's it, his list is done, a list of one.
We're going to have a YouTube video linked to this podcast episode, show notes with Andrew
giving a tutorial about how to change a tyre.
Watch out for that one.
Okay, I love that.
He's regretting that now.
I'm not doing that on the camera.
Why not?
You can talk about lean manufacturing.
Your lug nuts go in counterclockwise, right?
Is that correct?
Exactly.
Yeah.
- Coriolis effect.
- Perfect.
Anyway, they helped me with that.
We put the spare on and then I organized a time
to go and actually get the tire replaced
and turns out it was like sliced open
and I couldn't see the offending material in there
'cause it wasn't lodged.
- This is gaming corner, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Yeah, okay, just checking.
- Anyway, at the tire shop,
I thought I'm gonna be waiting a little bit
so I may as well amuse myself.
So I decided to take a portable Xbox Game Pass experience
along with me and I sat there with this,
which will be linked in the show notes for everyone to see,
the iPhone mounted in the SteelSeries Nimbus+
controllers mounting system.
And I'm sitting there playing like classic Halo
with my AirPods in and people are probably walking past
going, who the hell is this guy just sitting
in the tire shop, gaming away on his iPhone
attached to a controller?
- Oh, that's the best thing ever.
- I'd be far too embarrassed to ever do that.
I think the guy behind the counter was puzzled.
Were these, I, sorry, I'm completely beside myself right now.
Were those AirPods, AirPods Max, please tell me they were AirPods Max with the cable.
I'm so sorry, they were just AirPods Pro.
Damn.
Okay.
It's funny to say just because it's not like they're the cheapest things.
But no, far more discreet after you've got this, this contraption in front of you.
It just, I felt like, how could we amp that up?
I don't know, maybe some gigantic headphones with a cable.
- Exactly, but it was also just out of personal interest,
I wanted to see how it would fare over 4G.
And it was great, it was really good.
- You burnt your entire month of data.
How does that controller,
is that a standard feature of that controller?
- So what it is, when you buy them,
and these were a lovely gift from Natasha and her fam.
So the iPhone just slides in and out of this thing here.
So you can see I'm wobbling it and taking it out.
but then it's actually just a normal controller
that uses Bluetooth, but this thing,
whoops, comes out the top.
So normal controller, you got those little holes.
- Is that what makes it a plus?
- Perhaps.
- 'Cause I at one point had the regular Nimbus, I think,
and I'm pretty sure I gave it away to somebody
'cause I don't know where it is,
but I was curious what the plus meant,
but maybe that's the plus.
- That's amazing.
Wow, so you're sitting in the tire shop as you do,
waiting for usually what is forever,
and just jamming away on your Halo game on your phone
on a full-on controller, not on-screen controls,
full-on physical controller. - Full-on, yeah.
And I probably looked really weird,
not only 'cause of what I was doing,
but the flutter coming at me, like whacking me,
and I'm probably wincing every time
I have to kill these zombie creatures.
I just I love the idea of there being like on the tire shop discord, you know, all the fans of tire shop
They took a photo of you and you're like, hey everybody
Look at this loser. What the hell's going on? He's coming for some uh, some r55 slash 40s and look at him now
He doesn't even know what a tire is. What a loser. This is great
Well, if you had quizzed us prior to this conversation of gaming slash tire corner
TYRE, I assume.
Correct.
Yes.
I would never have guessed this.
So thank you for that.
You're welcome.
There will obviously be a note to this contraption that you're using.
I was also a little bit on the fence here as you, right as you're about to bring that
into frame.
Yeah.
So, as we go back to last episode and you dropped the bombshell on Andrew of PS, no
no big deal, got an Xbox Series X, you know, as you do.
And he basically openly wept on the show, like full on.
I thought, is he actually gonna pull out right now
the other mobile gaming controller thing
that I literally was just asking about, I think yesterday?
The Backbone One, whatever the hell it's called,
I forget what it's even called now.
But I asked about that yesterday,
much akin to how he asked about the Xbox on Discord
And then the next day you dropped that on him.
I thought you were about to just do it again
for two shows in a row.
And I just, I don't know if I would have been able
to handle that.
So I'm glad that it was at least something else
that related, but not the same.
So thank you for not crushing my dreams.
All right, and that is gaming corner slash tire corner,
which I don't think tire corner,
we don't really need artwork for that.
I don't think, I'm hoping that's not gonna be continuing.
- And also you shouldn't make tires out of corners.
should be circles. That would be wheelie stupid. He's turning into such a dad. I love it.
Oh man, his materials come thick and fast.
Apparently, apparently, a lot of like Apple podcasts are talking about something this week.
And I don't know, are we an Apple podcast? We talk a bit about Apple stuff, but I don't think
I think we're exactly an Apple podcast.
- Apple car, baby, here we go.
Oh, we're not talking about Apple car?
I thought out of tire--
- Apple car will probably have tires.
So we can probably just link this into tire corner.
- Okay, that's fair.
We'll push that for now.
- As it is written in our show notes,
W-W-D-C-2022.
- Yes, that's how they generally do it with the marketing.
I think that's their marketing for this year.
- And like, I just hear about all these people
doing Californian podcasts who all apparently went
to Apple Park and all participated in the live event.
Meanwhile, I'm sitting here in Perth, Western Australia,
Martin sitting in Wollongong, New South Wales.
And we're thinking,
we're never gonna have that opportunity.
- So lots of other podcasts have spoken about it already.
What could we possibly add that is of value to our listeners?
nothing because it's literally been a week since it happened and it affects no one at all for at
least another month when the public betas come out. But you've been jumping on the lock screen,
Bizzo, haven't you, Jason? Yeah, of course. I mean, I'm going to install whatever happens on
day one, no matter what. It's pretty, I mean, other than on the computer, I'm not, I'm not a
crazy person in that respect. I would never do dev beta one on a Mac. That just seems
Very scary. But yeah, I did the other ones and it's dev beta one.
And as with every year, everybody loses their mind about the whole thing.
Well, actually, no, they lose their mind all year about how bad everything is.
Then they become super positive about how great everything is
while they're like within the circle.
Then they leave and then start complaining again.
So that's kind of the normal routine.
But yeah, I mean, I think it's got a ton of potentially really cool stuff.
But I think given the last few years, it's like you got to wait and see,
hey, what's even going to actually make it in?
Because a lot of times stuff falls out and don't judge it until it's actually
of a quality that's worth judging.
You know, dev beta one is not when you start saying this crashes all the time.
It's like, of course it does.
It's called a developer beta.
Some of us are idiots and we install it on day one,
but I think it's got a lot of really cool new stuff in it,
and I think we're now at the point
where I think we thought we would be a couple years ago
where things would be more or less equal.
I think the Apple Silicon really helped,
excuse me, really helped start to get the software
closer together, and I don't mean feature-wise,
but just things working together, like camera continuity,
and a lot of the stuff between iPad OS and Mac OS
where the M1 is in,
but well, I know we have M2 now,
but the M Apple Silicon stuff
is now starting to show us a little more
of the benefit of that platform
when everything runs the same Silicon now.
And I think we still have a long way to go
and it's probably only going to get cooler going forward,
but something like the continuity camera
where you just say, "This is my webcam now,"
and you throw it on top of your thing with doing nothing.
that was not going to be a thing that was super possible back with Intel chips and ARM
chips. Like, yeah, you could probably make it work through just software, but having
this hardware be so tightly aligned is going to be super great going forward.
I'm pretty excited about that continuity camera thing.
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, I have a decent Logi webcam on my monitor right now, but I think it's a great
kind of admission from Apple that whatever kind of webcam you shove into a laptop lid,
particularly, is going to be limited by physics. And a lot of people in the tech sphere complain
about the quality of cameras from Apple or other companies. But if most people's best camera is the
phone that they carry, and you can make a secure or stable stand, whether it's for desktop or
laptop use, I think that's fantastic because- Yeah, I agree. And if you already have it-
Yeah, people aren't going out and buying them generally, I think, the same way that maybe-
No, the message is not go buy a thousand dollar iPhone to have a webcam.
It's like, you're in a meeting, your phone's just sitting on the desk anyway.
Just toss it up there and use it.
Why not?
That's it.
And I think the case is probably more so for, you know, older, quote, older
machines or just, yeah, like a laptop camera is never going to be as good.
So, I mean, I have the iMac camera and I don't think I go through a single
meeting without somebody saying how incredible it looks.
And I'm like, I don't know, like, yeah, it's fine.
And, um, yeah.
So I just think a lot of these things starting to be more tightly integrated is, is
nothing but good.
If you're in that, you know, having all of the quote ecosystem.
Well, I will just say quickly, one thing that I'm particularly excited about is the stage
manager feature. I know everyone's probably already been speaking about this, but did either of you
see a piece that John Gruber linked to called Shrinky Dink?
Yes.
You saw it, Andrew. I thought it was fascinating. There's this guy who, what was his name? I'm just going to check quickly.
Mr. Shrink E. Dink.
Yeah.
That's it. But he said that he was working at Apple during the Intel transition around 2006, and they were working on this feature,
which was shelved, which has kind of been used again or inspired to make Stage Manager.
And I think it's, obviously I haven't used it yet,
but I'm really excited about this idea
of some middle ground for the iPad and the Mac
where you can focus on an app and pull ones in and out.
I think a couple of people in our Discord said
that they thought it looked a little bit clunky
and that might be true.
But the idea that you can have this thing in the center
and then just go, oh, I can see what would otherwise
be invisible on the iPad.
'Cause the Macs always had that overlapping thing,
which some find messy, some don't,
but you get this idea of what's running.
whereas the iPad pushes those things to the background,
a strength and a weakness.
This is kind of, I think, an exciting opportunity
to kind of shuffle the cards around.
- Yeah, I'm excited to try it.
I don't have an iPad that can actually run it.
I immediately installed, I dragged out
the old 11 inch iPad Pro and installed the beta
and then was like, wait, how do I get it to go?
And then remembered, oh wait, this is M1.
I don't have that version of iPad,
so I can't really play with it right now,
but I would be intrigued to see what it's like.
It seems like it would be better
than what you're able to do right now
in terms of managing multiple things at once.
'Cause one of the biggest strengths of the iPad,
I still think, is the fact that it's one thing
in front of your face all the time
until you go to a different thing.
But there are definitely those use cases
where having the ability to kind of do,
if you want to call it multitasking
or whatever you want to call it,
just having multiple things more closely available to you.
If you don't need it, don't use it.
But if you do need it, it's nice that it's there.
- Yeah, not necessary, but icing on the cake.
- Yeah, but the iPad mini 6th gen
is still the best iPad ever.
So there you go.
- Sure, love it.
- That's WWDC.
Nothing to say because really nothing happened.
I mean, we saw slides, so we'll see what happens in the next few months and public
betas are in July.
So I do love the new lock screen stuff though.
I think that's a definite good step in the right direction.
As long as they fix that settings app.
Fix the settings app?
Yeah.
In the phone?
No, in Mac OS Ventura.
Oh yeah.
That's fine.
System preferences settings thing.
Literally the least big deal in the world.
Yeah.
I'm sure they'll get around to it.
And you're in set, like if you're in settings that much, I don't know what you're doing.
Jason, you haven't lived until you've maxed out the number of printers you can add to the list.
Now, Andrew, I'm seeing in the topic pool here that you have your own security detail.
Is that correct?
Before we get to that, I actually have some breaking news.
Beep, beep, beep.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, break some news.
OK.
Break it.
We just had a delivery to the house.
OK.
Xbox Series X.
What if it was?
Oh, it literally is.
I was wondering, I saw him come in with it.
I completely missed that.
Wow, is that the they just throw that on your porch like that?
Look at that.
It was in a bigger box.
Oh, it was in a bigger box.
OK.
I need to take a screenshot, everyone.
Big smiles.
Commemorating this moment for Andrew.
Wow. Look at you.
Show's over. See you, everybody.
I got to go.
I got to go set this up.
So, this will actually be my birthday present.
Did you buy it on a family member's birthday?
Just to be clear.
A birthday present for me.
No, but my birthday is coming up this week.
So, we'll put that into storage.
And it's actually not really for me.
It's really for kids, but you can't give a kid a present like that.
And he says that as he sets up the account to sign with the controller passkey in his name.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
This is for you. I just want you to know it's mine, but it's for you. Yeah. Yeah, really that's right
But if you want to use it you have to ask me and I have to unlock it
But I just think it's incredible that last week Martin did the grand reveal and then this week literally
The post he dropped it at the doorstep while we're recording worse. We just talked about it five minutes ago
Australia Post actually delivering on a weekend no less kudos Australia Post boy
I really want a Mac studio. Anybody? No? It comes out of the ceiling.
From the heavens, it descends. Wow, that's...
Wow, well, back, you know, quick swing back to Tire Corner. Congratulations on the Xbox
Series X. Yeah, that's... Now there are two thirds of the podcast have Xbox Series X.
So unlike one third has PS5 like Martin, it is a, it's a pre-owned reconditioned
one, cause that's the only way you could find them in Australia.
So I'm fingers crossed.
It's appropriately in good Nick.
Okay.
So we went back to gaming corner and then now we're back out of gaming
corner and back into security detail.
Yes.
Security detail.
Wow.
This has been a wild ride.
Also we're like far over time.
I think so.
We'll make it work.
Martin's editing.
I had the pleasure last weekend of meeting, very briefly, but meeting Australia's new Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese.
People may or may not realise, my wife is kind of in the political game.
She is at a state level, Albanese is at a federal level, but they're of the same party.
And Hannah and Albo have known each other for a long time.
So we were there because she was a state parliamentarian.
Did you call him that when you met him? I'm assuming not.
I didn't. I think I said "Prime Minister". Keep it appropriate.
But what struck me was... So this was a gathering of... It was like probably...
It wasn't just us, you know. It was a bunch of people and volunteers and supporters and all that.
So it was people who... It was a sort of an invited affair, not totally public.
But it was held in a public location. So there were probably 200 people that were like officially
there but because it was in a public location other people would just kind of
wander by and go "oh look it's the Prime Minister" and they'd kind of join the
the circle surrounding him as he was giving his speech and all that kind of
stuff and tune in. And what I thought was fantastic is that I dropped Hannah and
the kids there and then I drove off to find a parking spot because it was
pretty chaotic you know trying to find parking so I found a parking lot spot
And then like legged it for 10 minutes to get back to the event
So I had no like formal. Yes. I'm I'm a person who should be here
I had no ticketing nothing and I just wandered up and joined the crowd and
At no point was I challenged by security?
Asked to move on there was no there was no gated entrance
It was just you're in a park and you just wander up and there was security and there was police and all that kind of
But it was fine and I found Hannah and joined her and all that and I was just
wondering, I just thought this is awesome that we are in a country where you can
have the Prime Minister and no need for you know high-level security, there's no
metal detectors, there's no sort of one point of entry and exit and it was just
so straightforward and I just thought this is so nice for the way that we run
things here and I love the fact that it is as safe as that. You know I never felt threatened,
like was never looking around my shoulder going "oh geez what's gonna happen?"
You know so yeah it's um it was really cool and the only one thing I can reflect it on,
when I was in the US one time I was at an army versus navy football match at the Washington
Stadium. At this event Obama turned up at half time or something to do some sort of thing because it
it was army versus Navy and that's a big event. Jason, you'd know all about that, right?
Oh yeah, absolutely. Being from the Air Force. Mm-hmm. Yeah, big and you know, I'm big into
rugby so. Go army! Go Navy! Yep. It was really cool. Be it, you know, a filled stadium. I'm
always amazed they're able to play a full game of football with an army of one. I just,
I've always found that to be fascinating. It was a really cool thing. Lots of people
But I remember, so Obama was obviously entered in and he was down at ground level.
And we were in the stands and that kind of stuff.
And there was security detail and secret service, freaking everywhere, right?
And you knew, you just looked around and you had the guys with the little earpieces and
you're like, you knew that there was an important person about to turn up.
And it was just interesting, you know, that's my one experience of sort of the US president,
if you like.
And just the difference between Australia's head of state and then the way the Americans
have to do it.
And it's just a, I think it's a cool reflection on Australia that we're still so sort of egalitarian,
open and safe, that we can have an environment like that, where people can just come up in
close contact with their elected representative.
And I thought it was nice.
I have a question for you Andrew given the fact that you are now rubbing shoulders with PM elbow and you are a
Live broadcasting expert how long is it before?
Western Australia's preeminent basketball personality has his own security detail look
I think it's probably getting close to that point and he has an Xbox now
So like the target just grew that's true the target on your back is very true
put a chain around this thing.
Yeah, so it could well happen that I get that security detail.
I'll be OK with it.
I saw the photos, and I'm still skeptical that this event actually
took place.
And there's one main reason for that.
They seemed faked and Photoshopped, first of all.
There was-- you laugh, but the reason I say is because you missed--
the reason you missed it is because you're so in the trees already.
You just can't see what's going on, right?
So there he is in the photo.
What is he wearing?
Not Hi-Viz, faked.
(laughing)
- Yeah, he was actually in my backyard in New South Wales
and you just stole the photo
and made it look like Western Australia.
- There's no way he was actually in WA without Hi-Viz.
See, those are the little details you miss
when you're too far inside.
You should have got some outside consultancy on that.
Damn it.
- We're also heading to his electorate later today
to go see a movie. We drive through, see his face everywhere.
Really? You're that close?
That's not a joke, actually.
You're that close to it.
Yeah, it's in like in the West or something.
Where are we going? It's Leichhardt is where the movies are.
It's in Sydney. And that's where he's actually based.
So, the last time we went to a film festival there, it was just Albo's face just staring at you with this big smile, like, vote for me.
Was there any sausage sizzle action going on at this event?
There was. I missed it because I had to park the car and walk.
So, I missed the sausage.
I did get a slice of cake at the end though.
So that was good.
A congratulations cake.
What kind of cake was it?
It was chocolate with cream icing.
It was quite nice.
What did Albo just go and raid the local Woolies for a bunch of mud cakes or something?
Yeah, yeah.
It's like the five dollar, the five dollar Woolie mud cakes.
Like you chuckle and Jason's laughing, but that's like Australia's general go to cake.
Am I right?
You go to, you go get the Woolies mud cake.
Exactly.
If you're desperate at the last minute.
You're right.
That's, that's the go to.
But no, we did have a cake and the kids, I think it was David, got a slice of cake and
it was the one that where Albo had cut a slice, like he'd done his single cut and then, you
know, shuffled off, let somebody else deal with the actual divvying up.
David got the slice that the knife that Albo held helped cut.
So there you go.
So David has officially been knighted is what I'm hearing.
Yes, that's right.
It's equivalent to putting the run on the shoulder.
It's the same.
I mean, it's a cake thing.
a sword it's fairly so our newly elected leader basically said let them eat cake and walked
off that that bodes well in terms of history it'll be fine say yay democracy yeah too bad
about the sausage but maybe next time there's always another sausage there's too many show
titles this time
Anzac biscuits do you prefer soft or hard Anzac biscuits if you had to choose if no
medium option were around, which way do you go?
It's an easy answer.
I want, I want a crunchy one.
I want a hard crunchy.
You want a crunchy Anzac.
I knew he was going to go that route because he just, he's just that kind of guy.
I don't mind then if you dunk it and it becomes soft and then you can kind of almost suck the coffee back out of it and then munch the softened biscuit.
That's OK.
But soften straight out of the packet, like, no, that's yucky.
Good point. Jason, do you have any thoughts?
Are you big on the Anzac?
I would go with a medium.
A medium, yeah, that would be my choice, but if pressed, I wasn't quite sure which way
to go, but Andrew, you make a great point.
I don't like to be pressed.
You don't want to be pressed?
Push slightly?
No.
Okay, no pressing or pushing.
All right.
Good answers for both of you.
I feel like you're missing out on Anzac cookies.
They're really good.
Did you just call it Anzac cookie?
Did you say cookie?
Isn't it a biscuit?
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
It is a biscuit.
Oh, boy.
Oh, man.
There was a recent thing that happened to me where there was a piece of software that
I found I've used in the past specifically for work, tried to use it for other things,
never worked out.
Now that I am at a different working environment, picked it back up again and find that it just
is the best thing ever for specifically work.
And it made me wonder if either of you have had experience like that where there's an
app or a service where you use it for a specific thing, maybe personal or work, and yet you
think, well, surely this will work for the other parts of my life.
And it's just like, it doesn't.
And I don't even know if I can explain why, but I just found that to be very strange.
And I'll tell you what the software is, obviously, so you have some kind of example to go off
of.
The thing is, workflow-y, which I'm sure Andrew's aware of.
- It's an outliner.
- Outliner-y, thingy, which I find absolutely no use for
in my personal life whatsoever,
even though I feel like I should.
But for work, I find it is the best possible thing
for keeping track of notes.
And I know I go on and on about craft constantly,
and I love craft, but for some reason,
from a work standpoint, Workflowy just works.
Ha, I don't know, it's a weird thing
and it came up the other day and I was like,
holy crap, why am I not just using that again?
'Cause every other time I've used it for work,
it's been brilliant and I started using it again
and it's, surprise, surprise, it's brilliant.
Has that happened to either of you in any respect?
Andrew, go, I guess.
- I just wanna break down Workflowy just a little bit more
because it's an outliner and I get excited.
I do, oh, are you categorizing by day
or by topic or by meeting?
- Should I just send you a screenshot
of what it looks like?
Would that be helpful?
- Yes, it would be.
- Okay, let me open up messages
which takes four minutes to load.
- You need an Intel.
- Love it, still waiting, still waiting
and shared and send.
That is my, I don't know what you call it,
The bar on the side.
Yeah.
Okay.
Dracula theme that's on brand.
Daily log.
I like to see that.
So yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
If you don't have a daily log, you need to get checked out.
I use craft for my daily log these days.
Do you?
Interesting.
Yeah.
And in actual fact, to answer your question, I might even say craft is that product where I'm using it quite successfully for work, but it hasn't.
And nothing for personal.
I tried it for personal, but it just hasn't stuck.
And I think I've already got solutions on the personal side.
I still use Dev and Think.
I'm sorry, Jason.
I just do to keep all my archival material and forms and receipts.
You put notes in that.
Is that, you actually write notes in that interface?
No, not very rarely.
Very rarely do I write notes.
Mainly I am keeping files.
And that's what I find for personal that I don't actually write a lot of notes for myself other than the journaling in day one
Yeah, okay, so that's kind of where that happens. I have where would you jot down?
You know oh
I need to remember that my tire size is this because I'm going to the tire shop to play Halo like where would you put?
That it's a good question actually I probably put it in omni focus probably like you know on the
Go get tires.
P.S.
Here's the.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's probably where I'd keep it.
And so I do have, and in craft there are a few little random notes like that, but I just don't think to use it.
So I think craft for work, I'm using the heck out of that.
I've got backlinks and meeting notes and daily notes and everything in craft.
Gotta have a backlink.
For that.
So that's working well for that.
Okay.
Nice.
So yeah, that's probably my answer.
Also, of course, Microsoft Teams.
Well, yeah, that's more of like a forced situation.
And I typed a bunch of messages at home in Microsoft Teams and it just went and like there was nobody on the other end
It's just me
For your your home teams. Yeah
Well, I had to get a Microsoft account and they gave me a teams in instance guess what family we've got office
365 at home everybody's like throwing rotten fruit at you
Set up your team's account.
Everybody get into the Excel doc or setting up the meal plan.
And it's just like,
Well, actually, given given the fact that Andrew forgot the name of his own child, the who feature in teams would be great.
So you could type in David and then see his profile on Office 365.
And then you could see what your organizational structure is.
You're like, oh, OK, he's one of my direct reports.
Got it. That makes sense now.
Now, who's the CEO of the family?
Is it me or is it Anna?
You better go check your corporate directory if you have that question.
I think everyone knows already.
Everyone at the groceries and into the team wiki.
It's just constantly dad. So is it a team meeting or are we part of a team or is
this chat called the team? What about this as a team? And then you have to go
into, well, the word team in this area means eight different things depending on
where you're at. - And why is chat separate from team?
I still don't understand that.
I do not have an answer.
- I have an answer, but refer to the earlier episode
with the team's discussion. - I still don't understand it.
You've told me and I still don't get it.
Chatting and team, the same thing.
- Yep, you would think.
- You would think, but look,
as long as you have fun occasionally
and make everyone sit in the gallery view,
so it looks like you're all in the same room,
facing away from each other while you talk.
- Yeah. - That'd be great.
- That's ideal.
You really wanna make sure everyone's looking
100% away from each other.
- It makes no sense.
It's like everyone, we're gonna be in the same room together,
but as if we're watching some theatrical performance
looking straight ahead.
Like someone from Microsoft completely misunderstood
how in-person things happen.
- Maybe that's how they actually meet.
They all go into a room and just face forward.
- Do not look at my face.
Do not look directly at my face.
Look away.
- That's so good.
Martin, do you have an answer to this weird,
I guess you could call it a question. I think it's more of a curiosity path.
Yeah, I hope I'm going to answer what you've asked. For me, it was the power of when other
people are using something. So in my old job, when I used to work in Sydney, the boss there
was really interested in getting Slack to be a thing. And we all got on it. But people were
used to email and it didn't really work. And I saw the potential of it, but never got to use it to
its full potential. Similar thing with Discord, where at that same job, there was this intern
who came in and said, "Discord's the future. You're all losers for being on this other social media
stuff." And I looked at it and I went, "This gaming thing, like you are such, sorry, but you are such
a nerd young person. What would you know? This Discord thing's never going to take off."
This is the guy playing Halo at the tire shop.
Exactly. Who is now on Discord with his nerdy friends doing a podcast.
So, but it's funny how at the time, not everyone was using it or had limited reach, at least here
within work or kind of friend contexts, but the moment that, oh, other people are using it and you
can see the instantaneous convenience or the way that it connects a group with a common or niche
interest. Yeah, now they're two tools that I absolutely love. And by extension, like Andrew
said, Teams as well as an email replacement, they're apps that I thought, oh, yeah, they seem
useful, but here we go. Now they're part of my every day. And even things like, I remember years
ago I got Pixelmator, the kind of Photoshop alternative or equivalent, but never really had
need to do it. But as my work has changed, I've needed to do more of those things using Pixelmator
Pro now. It's one of the apps that I use the most on my computer to do stuff day to day. So
it's one of those things where you see that it's useful or maybe a good tool, but if the people
aren't there or the utility isn't there, then you move on. But they came back around to me.
This is sort of a tangent a little bit, but you mentioned both Slack and
Discord and having used Slack extensively now at work, which I never
really used it before.
And so for a while there, Slack was kind of all over the internet and like
everybody's like, Oh, join this Slack, join this Slack, join this Slack.
And then you had like 50 Slacks and then you're just like, I can't, I don't
even know what to do with this anymore.
And you just close the window.
But I use Slack for work now and Discord for, for really just for this show.
And I really do feel like for me personally, it's a personal thing, but Slack very much does feel
better suited for what I do at work versus Discord being more of the, I guess you could call it fun
stuff. I don't know. It just feels like those two naturally fit for me in those two worlds.
Instead of trying to say...
They also sell it that way, don't they? They sell it that way.
It's like, this is the gaming fun fandom area. This is where work can be done.
Yeah, I don't know. Like I would not personally,
I don't think want Slack to be both my work stuff and the like hemispheric views
show channel thing. For me, that just wouldn't work. I don't know.
Maybe others feel differently. Like, Oh, discord's the worst.
You should move this whole thing over to Slack. I,
I would be interested to know that I guess if, if people feel that way,
but I feel like discord just fits what we're doing better for this type of
thing. The community type of stuff.
I don't like it and I don't understand it very well and I get frustrated by it.
And also when I load it, I just, I get deflated.
I load it and I look at it and I'm just like, it just feels very stayed and boring and difficult to get into.
Yeah.
I think what I like about it is the integration stuff, cause it seems like it's so extensible and the amount of just crazy things we have built to do things automatically.
And if this happens, other stuff can happen based on what's integrated.
That part, I think would never be as possible on discord.
You know, like there's discord bots, which I find to be nothing but madness.
I wish there was actually ways to have plugins for discord because
the bots are just, they're inscrutable.
I don't, you have to like hire, you know, a 15 year old kid to be your
Discord admin to run all these friggin bots, because they just...
But that's what this intern thing was like that I mentioned.
It was like, look at this cool thing that he is.
I'm like, all right, cool.
Whatever.
And yeah, that sounds very, I don't know, old man Unix guy or whatever.
But it's just like, it's not good.
As much as you can make the bots and stuff work.
It's, I don't like the solution personally, but that's a different story.
But, okay.
- Well, these tools to me,
we took years to get there through social media pain
and all of the rubbish with Facebook
and news feeds and algorithms and stuff,
but just a nice place,
whether it's for work or friends or a shared fandom,
where you just go,
you have your group with a common interest.
And if the notifications get a bit out of hand,
because these apps can be quite complicated,
it means that you can go,
don't care about these three or four channels,
only notify me about that one or when someone says my name.
So it's complexity or ability to customize just means
that you can be bothered as little as you want.
And I like that.
- Yeah, I agree.
- All right, well, we agree.
That's fine.
- That's like, there you go.
I mean, if we're agreeing,
that's probably the best time to stop, right?
(upbeat music)
There was three good titles that I already heard in this one.
And I hope that I-
That's the one thing I keep forgetting to pull out as I'm listening to it is the damn title.
Well, I just assign it when I edit it.
So I don't even let you two have a-
I know.
I know.
Look in.
I never think about the titles.
I just leave it to you two.
I never, never even crosses my mind.
There we go.
So when Andrew edits, Jason chooses the title.
And when I do it, I get to decide everything.
It's very different paths that I take on notes, depending on who's doing it.
Really?
- Really? - Because on, yeah,
on the Martin side, he (beep) me out of a title choice,
so he just takes it, he just takes it from me,
like you get nothing.
Oh, you like that candy?
And then he just smacks it out of my hands.
- Yep. - So I get nothing on that.
I get to pick a title when Andrew does it,
but the other thing that happens is that when Andrew does it
he does 7,000 chapter markers,
and Martin does like three.
So, when I go through and do the timestamps, it's like on an Andrew week, it's like, "Oh
shit, here we go.
I do a bunch of chapter markers."
It's true, I do a few, but not as many as Andrew sometimes.
No, you do way less chapter markers generally.
I love chapters.
Than Andrew does.
Yeah, I can tell.
Like someone breathed, "Insert a chapter marker."
Exactly.
It's like when you read a book.
I always prefer a book with short chapters.
Yeah.
you can read five chapters and stop, you know, but we can read one chapter and do
it quickly. But if you got a book with a long chapter, you just commit it.
You just got to grind through.
Andrew will just be going along and he'll be like, Oh, chapter.
And then just put one. And it's like, why'd you put that? I don't know.
I just thought of the word chapter. That last word rhymed with chapter.
So I just put one. I haven't met a chapter lately. Chapter. So yeah,
he's like chapter guy.
(laughs)
