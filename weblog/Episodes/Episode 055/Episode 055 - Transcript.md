This is desk roast 2022.
Probably that's a lot of sound effects.
We just need some more of the whippersnippers coming from Martin's side and we'll be set.
Can we have toilet guy?
Flush.
Toilet guy, whippersnipper guy, car guy and just random shouting guy outside.
Toilet guy is always really exciting when he directs right at the water and not at the bowl because you get a lot more.
Oh that's nice yeah that really sings.
Hey unless that baby.
That could be a goat more severance goat.
That was more animal like than human but yeah.
We're just doing an animal impressions corner now.
In a very related topic, desk review 2022 for April 1st, 2022.
Or April 2nd.
Whose desk?
What?
Depending on your hemisphere.
Shit.
April 1st/2nd, 2022.
Also not the date when people will be listening, but just pretend listeners.
Work with us.
Insert date here, 2022.
It detects expenditure.
Yeah, you just do the fill in.
Dot ds.
It'll all work out. So today, Perth bandits, also known as, oh wait, can I, do I, do we say that?
Yeah, yeah, he's, I don't think there's any.
He's pretty public. He's like basically a government official or something, right?
For the NBL.
He's beloved in Perth. So it's important to know that too.
Yeah. And people know him on the street. So Nick Tan has sent us his desk slash office,
I will assume. And we are going to just tear this room apart and overanalyze
every single decision he has made about this space.
Yeah, if you go back in the Hemispheric Views audio archives, you'll find that we did a series
of desk reviews quite early in our run. They proved to be quite popular. They were enjoyable.
It was people who like computers and stuff like that are usually quite obsessive about their
workspaces. And so much of one's personality can be reflected in their workspace. And that's what
we found in those desk reviews. Yes, and now we're back at it. Back at it again with the white vans.
Yeah. I mean, if you don't love a desk, I just, I don't know. I don't know what to say.
It's just, it's your home for so many hours of the day.
There's a lot about a person.
It really does.
And I guess we'll just jump right in.
Yeah, let's do it.
And of course, play along at home.
We'll have links in the show notes.
MP3 artwork.
Check it out in your player.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We've been given explicit permission to share this desktop.
So he signed a contract.
Don't worry.
It's fine.
What I'm going to say right out of the gate is I'm going to ask both of you for your opinion on this.
What is the percentage chance on any given day that you walk into this room?
And it's this friggin clean.
Do we really believe, are we led to believe, ladies and gentlemen, that it looks this impeccable on any given day of the week?
What do you both think?
Well, I think in this particular case, I don't want to accuse him right up of being like a YouTuber.
You know, when you see YouTubers who are like, check out this review and it's like no one has ever even breathed in that room.
Yeah.
I think in this case there has been maybe some preparation but I will add that I think the reason this picture is so insect free is because there is a flying insect killer spray ready on the windowsill.
You could do a work.
That is the yeah given where he's at that is probably empty I mean look at the cage on the window to keep the bugs and animals out right.
Well, clearly he's misunderstood flyscreen mesh because if he had actual mesh,
the insects wouldn't come in. I think it's just a series of interconnected holes.
This feels like the Starbucks cup that was left in the Game of Thrones shot,
right? Where they cleaned up the whole scene, everything looked great. And then somebody said,
what the f**k, there's insect spray, like right there. Like, how did we miss that?
Where was the PA to go grab the insect spray? So that's a fair point. That's what led me to
believe that this was maybe a little bit of a setup job.
Not to mention you zoom in, it's black and gold.
He's gone for like no frills, you know, full on classic Australian.
It is no frills, but it also is the state colours of Western Australia, black and gold.
Oh, so he's just being on brand.
Yeah.
Really is what you're saying.
Fantastic.
All he needed to finish the on brandness was a Hy-Vee's vest just hanging over the back of that chair.
I think that's what's behind the camera he's actually wearing.
He's wearing it because he's performing a photo and there's that's a that's dangerous work.
Okay, so past the fact that it is disgustingly clean, these photos on the wall are the very first thing that come to my mind in that they are.
Oh yeah.
Huge.
Yeah.
Obviously basketball related.
I think that's no big surprise.
I feel like I can add some value on these.
If you've got any questions, I think I can probably help out a little.
Well, I think we all know it's the Chicago Bulls, so that's clear.
I mean, that's, you know, the greatest basketball team in the world.
I don't know.
In Australia, for sure, yeah.
Yeah, they're very big in Perth, the Chicago, Chicago Perth Bulls, I think they call them.
But no, these photos are, I would say, legendary in the size.
The one in the top is, looks almost like an illustration of some kind,
which I have to imagine, maybe this is a gift, I don't know.
But I'm loving the fact that there are not, there's not one, but two of these
magnificently large wide photos above the desk.
I think that's a great backdrop.
Um, Andrew, feel free to jump in.
Granted, I'm obviously a MBL like pro and I know everything about it, but
you're learning so much.
Let's just say that I knew nothing at all about NBL, Perth, Wildcats, none of that.
What could you tell me about both of these, um, giant photos?
Okay.
So what we've got here is a reflection of the Perth Wildcats who are the most successful franchise in the Australian National Basketball League
They have ten titles to their name. I think the next best is gosh testing my memory. I think another team has six
I think it might be Adelaide perhaps with six. Is that the Illawarra team?
I feel I should know that but now now I'm blanking out. No Illawarra have got one
I think they have won one in all their time. It's more than zero. That's what I'm saying. More than zero
But what we're seeing in that picture is so the the illustration is a reflection of all those ten championships
And the great players that have participated in those so it's taken
What they look like, you know, this sort of the representation of the players at the time that they won
But all brought into a single picture in the locker room holding the various trophies in the different
uniforms that were worn at the time all
Legends of the club.
So like you're Michael Jordan's, you're Larry Bird's.
Yes, exactly.
Exactly.
Okay.
Two observations about this picture.
Actually three observations, right?
Number one, the guy with the number four who's high-fiving, Watto.
Is that a mullet?
Yes.
Eric Watterson was famous for the, he played I think 302 games for the Perth Wildcats, somewhere around that.
And yeah, he had the epic mullet from the 80s.
So that was the original mullet generation.
I love that they specifically painted this or drew it or whatever so that he was backwards.
So they could show that off.
That's fantastic.
It is great.
Like should we show his face?
Like, no, nobody knows what he looks like.
Everybody knows the hair.
Have him go the other way.
My second point or question is something you see a lot in men's locker rooms, at least, you know, on live TV is the supportive butt slap.
And I'm not seeing that in this picture.
Is that something that happens a lot in basketball, Andrew?
They call that the good game.
There is still a butt slap.
There's still a butt slap. I think there's less butt slap than there used to be.
Yeah. I think there's a bit more, you know, hand high fives these days.
I think the butt maybe just a little bit more.
I'd give you a good game.
A little bit more aware that perhaps it's not the appropriate way to dap somebody up.
Good to clarify, because it does pop up.
And I thought surely there would have been one in that room.
Now, my third point is I think this is a great picture.
Locker room of dreams. It's very emotive.
It's a nice moment in time.
I love that the illustrator.
This isn't something that Nick Tan has done by himself, right?
No, no.
This is someone, right.
I love that they've acknowledged the fact that most people who take photos cut people's feet off at the bottom of the picture.
It happens constantly in family photos that people take who aren't me.
You just cut their heads off and leave the feet.
And basketball players have big feet as well.
So it's very difficult to frame.
But it just it obviously shows these people are quite tall and they had to make a compromise.
And what you'll see under that is a picture of a full Perth arena.
With people all decked out in red being the current color of the Perth Wildcats.
That is, I don't, it's hard to say.
I don't have the resolution, but I'm thinking that might be a game against maybe New Zealand, which is a great rival of Perth Wildcats.
Maybe a grand final, maybe a winning, maybe at the winning moment.
I can't see.
I don't know.
I'm guessing there a little bit, but that is a great place.
Well, it's a great place to watch basketball.
I'm a bit of a stickler.
I like the old small stadium they used to play in.
It had a bit more of a earthy vibe to it, but it is the largest basketball
venue in Australia and it is filled up quite regularly.
Wow.
I wonder if he took that photo.
I'm curious if that was a event he was at or just one that he found.
That will have been a purchased photo from a photographer.
Okay.
Nick sits way too close to the court to bother walking all the way back up into the stands to take that.
What a stupid question for me to ask.
He wants to feel the sweat of the players as they run past.
He does.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And scream abuse at the opposition.
They call that ambiance.
Okay, so we've got the photos.
There's another photo that I'm super intrigued by in the corner that we can't see what it is.
And I want to know what that is as well.
But we're going to have to skip that for now.
I'm assuming it's-
Element of mystery.
Some basketball thing.
It has a red edge.
I'm going to have-
So you'd have to think it's-
It seems like a pretty high likelihood that that is a basketball related item.
Yeah.
So we'll just say that it is.
So moving down, if we kind of go left to right, apparently he has his own bobble head.
I'm assuming that's him with the beard.
He is a god in his own home.
He's a god in his own home.
That is, I can confirm that is a very good likeness of Nick Tan.
I don't know how you-
So it is to scale.
That's actually how large his head is.
His head is massive.
Yeah, it's just a gigantic head with a gigantic beard, you know.
Wow.
Is he always fixed to one surface in that manner, or does he have free range of movement with his legs?
His legs do move, but his head moves a lot more.
So, you know, his leg will move one phase and his head bounces back and forth five, six times.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's really dangerous.
Yeah.
And he's sitting on some speakers.
Okay. So, we've got our classic bookshelf speakers, as they're called, which tie
together with the gigantic receiver in the middle of the desk, which is being used-
It's the base for a display.
As a monitor stand.
Yeah, I've never seen a receiver as a desk.
Never.
First time.
Never. No, that is a first in desk history to have a full-on receiver. I think it's a
pioneer, can't quite tell.
Morantz, is it?
It looks like my rant.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, that's the that is the centerpiece of the desk driving those bookshelf speakers.
So he's clearly into having quality sound while he's computing and in true receiver style.
The display never matches the input that you actually want it to say.
So it's saying CD and I'm going to guess that it's not CD that's being put through it, but you never have the right input label.
No, I would I would hope not.
Yeah.
So if I back up then, we've got obviously the centerpiece
being the MacBook Air, I believe that is, M1 MacBook Air.
He's discussed loving that machine.
Seems like he still does 'cause it's there still.
On this interesting stand that I know I've seen before,
can't place who makes it and can't for the life of me
remember what the hell that little weird slider
in the front does, other than maybe adjust the angle.
but I don't remember who makes that stand.
- Actually, I think it's what happens is as you type,
it shifts along like a typewriter.
- Oh, and then you gotta reset before you can go, okay.
That makes sense.
- At this stage, it's not actually in use
because very impressively, I think he's planted this.
He's listening to the Lumen Industries music experience
on his computer. - Yes, I like that.
- So, yeah, that is fantastic. - Yeah, very nice.
- It does feel like he was very purposeful.
- Maybe what happens is it adapts
kind of like the touch bar.
So he doesn't have a touch bar.
Apple's moved on from that with these models,
at least it was never on the air.
So I think when he's typing,
that slides along like a typewriter.
Now that he's listening to music,
it actually represents quite coincidentally,
the timeline of where he's up to in the track.
So it moves along depending on where he is in the song.
- It's an analog touch bar.
- It's a jog shuttle.
- Exactly, yeah.
And you can rewind just by pulling that slider.
- Slide it over.
- That makes sense. - Genius.
- I like that.
- That is good.
- I want to get one of those.
I like that idea.
- On his other monitor,
You notice he's got the Hemispheric Views Discord on screen.
I like that.
Very popular.
I've heard good things about it.
He's looking at his own desk.
Photos of himself, his own desk.
And then, yeah, then magic moment from the Oscar ceremony.
That was a time that happened.
I want to highlight something else, which I think is a big statement in Apple land.
I'm not as offended by this accessory as some others are.
The fact that he has put away the magic mouse, but clearly in view near the preferred mouse,
which is what looks like some sort of Lodgy MX Master or something.
MX Master 3.
What do you two think of this?
I think it's hilarious how often I see the magic mouse close to the computer, but not
being used.
I may need that touch surface one day.
I like to think it's a backup mouse, so that when the Logitech eventually does what it
does best and starts stuttering and crapping all over itself.
So you can grab a mouse that will actually track correctly.
So I think that's the study, isn't it?
Yeah.
I think that's what that is.
It has to be right.
I think that's it.
And then I'm confused about what the thing is next to it.
I assume it's some kind of USB hub type thing because there are all of these
other things connected yet only one plug into the MacBook Air.
Are you looking at that giant red thing with the handle?
No, no, not the red thing.
The red thing I'm very concerned about in terms of it being dangerous.
But I think the black box next to the standby mouse.
Oh, yeah. I thought it was his glasses case.
Oh, that could be.
That is a glasses case.
Is it? OK.
Yeah, it looks like one.
Interesting.
Yeah, I think so.
Or maybe where he keeps his tobacco.
He's going Bluetooth with the MX Master, which is probably driving him up the wall,
if I had to guess, because using an MX Master on Bluetooth is like being in hell.
So they've still not fixed that?
I don't know. I threw mine in the garbage, so I have no idea.
I was done even trying to make that work.
OK. So I have a question about this multi display thing, because we were speaking recently.
One of you, no, both of you asked me about whether I like one or two displays.
Sure Mr bandits has three displays technically now I want to know because he was talking about it in the discord is that.
Display on the far right exclusively for the PlayStation game that he plays or is it part of the full suite and he will actually take the logo off it.
In my heart I like to believe that that is 100% dedicated to the PlayStation and that is all that it does so that while he is doing anything.
Work related in this office he can always at a moment's notice turn.
Ten degrees to the right and be playing PlayStation instead I like to think that's what's going on I believe that to be the case I think it's purely a gaming.
Screen I've got even more so I'm gonna taking over this year two things in this that I feel a very.
Australian or at least resonate with me or the bit nostalgia his office chair first of all I'm very impressed Nick that you have an office chair that doesn't have arms or armrests I'm a non armrest guy.
It looks like an office chair like he stole it from work.
Well it looks like it has the upholstery of you know appropriate and sensible public transport to avoid showing.
Yeah that's great and I'm not having a go it's clever because if you spill some coffee on that no one's gonna tell.
No, and you can just go swap it out with another one at work and then you have a brand new chair
And it's the same as office theft just to you know, but you're an office date. It's a loan
Yeah, I think we call that a loan. It's a loaner. I'm not theft. I jumped the gun. No, it's a loaner one more point
Then I'll stop taking over his felled foot looking through the window again past the mesh free
Interlocking holes. Mm-hmm the tiny hot tub. I don't know if you have this feeling Andrew, but what was that the tiny hot tub?
I will that's just gonna save the brickwork with that overhanging palm tree just looks like every family resort.
I went to in like the late 90s and early noughties as a kid.
Yeah, I want to believe so so badly that it's just it's a little hot tub out there.
During the day he just feel like you know what hot tub time is that a band is that like a miniature bamboo fence as well.
It does look like it doesn't I'm not sure what that is like a little tiki think seeky house kind of thing.
I just imagine like Jeff from Survivors coming out and telling him the tribal council has spoken or something.
Yeah, it's just like, I think it's like, hey, it's 3pm.
It's time for a Mai Tai going out to the hot tub.
That's what I like to think.
But the PlayStation thing just made me realize that the timing of this is that he set everything up.
Turned the PlayStation on, waited for the logo, then took the photo.
Because this is not, I do not believe a screensaver situation.
This is like a boot logo.
So this was very well thought out and timed in terms of I want to make sure everyone knows.
I've got a PlayStation dedicated here.
There's a lot of effort in this photo.
One other thing I really like is just above the PlayStation TV.
You'll see a socket on the wall and this to me is also very Australian yes yes because this looks to me like an RF cable input.
So something that you would you would have a roof antenna and for free to air television you would plug your TV into that to get good reception and.
In true modern Australian fashion it it continues to exist and yet it has nothing plugged into it because who the hell uses free to air television these days.
It's like when you see plastic plates that say telecom on them.
I thought it was like an RJ45 phone thing.
I think it's round though.
Is it round?
Maybe you're right.
It looks like the TV one.
Anyway, I just assumed because of the height that you would put one of those like phones right?
Because it's kind of at grab level maybe?
Yeah.
Yeah, it could be free to air too.
We need a high resolution photo, don't we?
Well I want to thank Nick Perth Bandits tan for his submission of his desk and I think it's overall a lovely place and I would love to visit and mostly go into the tiny hot tub with a margarita.
Will they get the next chemistry reviews made up is now happening in the tan tub.
Tiny hot tub we're gonna record in the tan tub.
Somehow we're going to fit multiple people adult sized into the tub and it's going to be great.
I already have the title of the episode planned. It's going to be a bubbly affair.
See, I was going to go with hot tub tan machine.
Oh, that's better.
Yeah.
I think a hot tub tan machine is the episode title for this one now.
I don't know.
He's going to see it pop up and be like, what the fuck is this?
Oh, God.
Well, thank you, Nick, as well as both of you for your kind input.
And I guess the last thing real quick is just, Nick, if you could look at that red thing on your desk and make sure that's like up to code.
Yeah.
I'm just.
Earthed.
Let's get one of those safety tags put on it.
Yeah.
Checked.
Or put a tiny little high-vis vest on the thing, just so at least everyone can understand what's going on.
Just need to see a label.
This was last checked in September 2021 or something.
That's all we need or like check office for latest certification something just to give us some kind of you know
Yeah, we don't want you dying in a horrible electrical accident. No. No, there are many more things
We need you to design for us. So yeah, okay
All right count us down counting down in three two one stop
Oh my mouse died.
