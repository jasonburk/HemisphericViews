it's a new year and we're back two-thirds of us 2025 is the year and we have new year's

resolutions ready to go do we no we don't well andrew had one new year's resolution

and that was to do uh less podcasts so he's not here which is kind of awkward

but he might be back next time hopefully we think he'll be back next time well for the listeners

guess where he is it's where he was on holiday that time ages ago and he phoned in and made

the editing kind of strange it was exmouth or exmouth oh exmouth exmouth i don't and

which is actually perfect considering that he's not here because he used to be on the

show he used to use his voice and now he's an exmouth he's no longer with us did you say it was

perfect it was a perth perfect way of saying that he's an exmouth

the artist formerly known as mouth is i think where he's at right now so we hope he's enjoying

it um no we don't have new year's resolutions but i am curious from a new year perspective

we have

hemispheric views obviously we have the whole debacle that is it's winter here and summer there

we still don't know how that works but here we are somehow how how is new year how can i even ask

this what is new year like for let's just andrew's not here but for you let's say you know for me

you you know outside of kids children all that stuff like in general you know what what's a new

year kind of situation for you what's a new year kind of situation for you what's a new year kind of

celebration look like in new south wales is this a big deal or what's going on over there well look

as listeners know i am from the city of wollongong wollongong has its own kind of family friendly

9 a.m fireworks on new year's eve but it's a much more modest affair right if you wait sorry sorry

9 a.m did i say 9 a.m that shows how much sleep i'm on at the moment 9 p.m okay i was like wow

things are very different over there you're just kicking it off early okay

i'm thinking 12 a.m but saying 9 and not switching the time look this is a great start i'm on little

sleep um that's part of the new year anyway starting that again 9 p.m right very family

friendly thing sydney does a similar thing right around the harbour but when it strikes midnight

12 a.m to be precise yeah i don't know if you've seen that on tv or anything but the sydney harbour

fireworks are a massive deal like they're huge like a lot of expenditure and i haven't personally

ever been to see it live because to get there would be i don't know how stressful just to get

there in terms of transport and find a spot um it looks very impressive on tv um generally kind

of new year's stuff for me and my family that we get together with family we might go out and do

dinner or this time it was more sort of um you know extended family at home and just having a

nice time but the new year kind of beyond that if that's what you're asking i think it would

just feel very different probably from what it does in the northern hemisphere i've been in the

northern hemisphere just after new year's but kind of just there for travel plonking myself after

the calendar is ticked over our extended school holidays happen in summertime right which is

december january so it's a very different feeling for christmas in the new year everything's brighter

it's very very warm people are out doing stuff at the beach it's recreational kind of time so

to me it's a really super optimistic period and i have a lot of fun family memories of going to the

beach and spending time with friends and stuff and that's not to say that it isn't a happy time

for northern hemispherians right but it's a different time it's more of a romantic winter's

image do you know what i mean whereas here it's summer holiday so i feel it's a very bright and

lovely time quickly the reality of life takes over that oh wow you know we're leaving that period and

the coldness is returning and get back to work um which is a very happy time for us

nice in its own way but yeah it starts off super optimistically and you go wow the seasons continue

to change and then you slip back into it how do you feel is it a is it a fun time for you is it a

cozy time what what's new yeah i i was expecting you to have kind of a a beach fun what i would

consider something here where people would do like a fourth of july beach kind of thing because that's

in you know summertime here yeah it feels like that's what it would be like there for new year

because it'd be beach it'd be hot

it'd be fireworks it'd be you know celebration i don't know what what about okay what about a go-to

is there a go-to new year snack type thing or food or beverage item right i just think really um and

it depends how much you lean into this stereotype particularly for australia i really think of

barbecues and that sort of thing people might have really bland kind of barbecues which are just 10,000

greek or kind of stereotypically ethnic barbecues um imagine things on skewers and suvlaki and all

that kind of stuff um you see a lot of and it's really beautiful particularly in wollongong down

on the shoreline you see a lot of migrant families and you've seen how the demographics have changed

over time there used to be a lot of people from former yugoslavia and greece then more people from

china and southeast asia and nowadays you see a lot of people who've migrated from middle eastern

countries and they all bring their own take on the barbecue

to these same communal barbecue areas and parklands and you know with park benches on the shoreline

next to these beautiful norfolk pines that line the beach like around north beach particularly

in wollongong so to me it's a lot of barbecue foods people bringing their own spin on it

from their own culture of course there's you know there's party foods like the uh the cheesel who

doesn't love the cheesel in australia um put the cheesel can can you can you expand on that

for those that may not be familiar it's not a summer food it's not a summer food it's not a

summer or new year specific thing but cheesels are essentially these rings right they're these

kind of small cylinders yellowy orange perfect for this show actually jason we can describe

and argue whether they're yellow or orange as we do on the show for our own artwork

and you stick them on your fingers right and you have a cheesel party and i hope natasha

doesn't mind me telling this story but there's this kind of infamous story within her family

where this is a while ago now you know inflation directs otherwise nowadays but

her dad noticed that uh cheesels were a dollar a box at the supermarket back when they were still

at school so he was like you gotta go and get cheesels and they didn't need anything else so

they bought 10 boxes for like a dollar each so 10 boxes for 10 dollars and the checkout person was

like are you having a cheesel party or something and with that many cheesels you could put them on

all digits like a whole extended family could line all phalanges with cheesels and they've just got

this kind of yellowy cheesy dust on them anyway i digress but um yeah you've got barbecue foods

i just i think it's a good idea to have a cheesel party and you can put them on all digits and

back to being a kid and having like barbecue and pizza shapes you know shapes right going to the

local continental pools with my bubba and ditto that's um absolutely my grandmother and grandfather

so it's just this super optimistic time and maybe tell me if you agree with this or not because you

might feel differently because you have that summer holiday in the middle of the year we all we all

see that in australia and elsewhere in the southern hemisphere through movies right but that's in the

middle of your year and it kind of divides it strangely at least to me for me when the school

year finished it's like

see you later christmas is coming summer holidays reset like to me it's a huge physical and mental

reset to actually get in the ocean and even that feeling of salt water is this cleansing thing it's

like all this stuff of the year is now kind of washed away literally and figuratively by going

to the beach and having this it's like this purge and burning by fire of the sun and this salty wash

of the ocean whereas i don't know do you feel that way in winter time with new year's like you're

more inside you're more in the middle of the year and you're more in the middle of the year and you're

more in the middle of the year and you're more in the middle of the year and you're more in the middle of the year and you're

don't have that kind of purging of that feeling no definitely not i think yeah because it is winter

and it's cold everything i i don't know if i would use the word romantic like you did but i do think

there is this sort of intimacy to winter and maybe that is because the i mean you know it's cold

therefore you're naturally kind of closer to yourself closer to other people maybe but

yeah it does not feel like a reset at all it feels like a like a

like a speed bump in the middle of the year to be perfectly honest it's like this and especially now

you know where we're at where we're further north to where we have much wider swings in daylight

time where previously i was further south so it kind of was just half and half most of the year

daylight and and night whereas now in the winter it's dark at like four o'clock yeah so you sort of

lose a lot of that time and you're like oh my god i'm so tired i'm so tired i'm so tired i'm so tired

you almost especially if you're going out when i when i used to go to an office it was the

the kind of you know it's kind of a trope now but like you'd get to the office when it's dark

you'd work all day and then you'd leave the office when it's dark and it's just this like

that sounds miserable uber depressing thing of like any amount of daylight doesn't matter because

you're working during those hours so i i i definitely could i think i could appreciate

the fact that you could have this kind of turnover at the new year

of cold to warm that seems like a nice natural fit now if we decide to change everything to like

an eoffy schedule here maybe we could get realigned instead of using calendar year we use eoffy

schedule maybe that would help us here i don't know i'll try to get it pushed through but even

being away andrew has just felt a tingle right he's just felt a disturbance in the force i'm

glad you brought that in because even though andrew can't be with us today he's here in spirit

happy eoffy andrew

months early that's what we're going to try to do okay but yeah funny you said all that because um

with uh the daylight thing it's gotten to the point now that the days here are so long that

sunlight is here for so long that i don't know if you remember that simpsons episode where

bart lisa and maggie get relocated to the flanders next door because homer and marge are deemed to be

unfit parents so the flanders become their caretakers or guardians like foster carers

or something and it's like good night sweet children and it's it's like why the children

are still playing with the flanders and they're like oh my god i'm gonna be like oh my god i'm

playing outside it's still sunny and every time we put mac to bed i feel like some sort of really

dodgy parent who's trying to put him to bed too and i look at the clock and i'm like oh no wait

that's correct yeah it's fine it's summertime yeah but um i should say as well because and i'm

trying to be very aware of this when i speak to people either locally or you know like you

overseas i'm saying all of this is like a white westerner in australia talking about seasons and

stuff but this could be interesting for people listening particularly from overseas that if you

talk to aboriginal australians or torres strait islander

people in australia they have within their own local cultures and nations their own peoples they

actually have a really different idea of the seasons we talk about summer autumn winter and

spring with this imported western idea but if you spoke to a local person like i live on darawal

country and where i live is like the original home of the the traditional wadi wadi people

they have a different idea of how many seasons there are and they had such intimate knowledge

of the climate and the climate of the world and they had such intimate knowledge of the climate

and the turn of the weather and how animals and plants behaved that in some particular cultures

for example they would say that there are six seasons that makes sense yeah so it's kind of

like oh yeah we divide it in quarters and here it goes and then in australia like we would say

oh first of september first day of spring but we all know that it actually doesn't happen then it's

technically slightly earlier or later but we go you know what can't be bothered it just goes with

the calendar so i'm saying it with this really lazy westerner thing of summer's started but if

you actually spoke to a more traditional person like on country here they would say oh yeah

it's a little bit more nuanced than that yeah people can look that up i'm sure put stuff in

the show notes but there's a lot to kind of uh appreciate that's very different about the climate

here it completely makes sense you why would you make an artificial time frame for nature like

nature knows what it's doing you should probably base it off of that but yeah here we are with our

no no we'll just just bring the ideas from britain it works industrial such and such clock this is

when spring and summer start all right oh if only i could have more

daylight savings time um

uh so you know i think it's pretty well known we don't we don't look back here on the podcast

except when we do so i just wanted to quickly before we left 2024 to 2025 corner uh i we posted

our kind of year end we do a little bit of a recap thing you know some people are into that

i think it's just interesting to know what happened in the year we did one for 2020

um for everyone that's listening uh we did it um surprising no one hopefully at the end of the year

which is when you would do a recap of the year would be at the end so we didn't do it in november

if you were looking for it it wasn't there yet because the year wasn't over so for 2024 i just

want to share a couple interesting stats that i thought worked fun 26 episodes last year which

feels like not very many but also a lot but i think the consistency is there so i think good job us

you're welcome

yeah we talk a lot about the infamous i would say infamous type 45 i'd say it's infamous right

yeah people have heard the good word of the type 45 we were off in 2023 um i don't remember the

exact number but we were not on average type 45 but i am here to tell you for the good of the

podcast for the good of the world really uh in 2024 if you looked at the type 45

meter all 26 episodes we averaged 45 minutes and zero seconds good job us round of applause

are you serious that's actually the average for all 26 episodes 45 minutes zero seconds

i am not kidding that is how good and professional we are martin okay it's amazing i think between um

my kind of pushing for shorter episodes and the occasional going over whether it's because we have

a lovely guest or we just don't shut up ourselves

um it works that well doesn't it yep it's great it does yep and uh just a few other quick items

uh we added nine one prime plus.com members i'd say let's try to get that to be uh plus 10 or more

in 2025 and you can directly help us with that by going to a one prime plus.com and signing up

beautiful and just so people know uh one prime plus is a little bit sporadic you know because

it is hard to kind of put this stuff together but we do appreciate the support of people

on one prime plus who are in that members discord who do get those occasional episodes and who are

supporting basically the hosting and the running of this show like you're helping us do stuff that

kind of costs time and money it's a hobby we love it we want to be here for everyone and we enjoy

each other's company but there is a kind of labor reality to this so we do appreciate people's

support and at the beginning of this year already there's been a members episode about a very hot

topic i found out from natasha i had no idea sandwich shops i was just talking about sandwich

shops and natasha was like oh my god i'm not going to do that i'm not going to do that i'm not

Asher said, at least in Australia, because we're months behind anything in the world,

I think, culturally or as a trend.

It's like, oh, sandwich shops are a big deal.

We pass by this new one in town and there's a line out the door.

Yes, it's more of the trendy hipster style than what I was talking about on the member's

show, but somehow we are on trend, at least in Australia and Lungong, we didn't mean it.

Totally.

Yeah.

And One Prime Plus, not only extra stuff, but it also just supports the main free show.

Yeah, exactly.

As I said, you're supporting the labour of love.

Yeah, if you just love the regular show, feel free to jump on oneprimeplus.com,

maybe get a couple extra things.

So there you go.

Thank you.

Most popular, most downloaded episode, number 108.

And then finally, locations with the most downloads.

US, Australia.

Really?

Wow.

UK, Germany, France.

Those are the top five download locations.

Slight upset from last year.

France.

Edging out Canada.

So step it up, Canada.

Ooh.

So some follow-up, and I'm actually going to make this a Turbo Media Corner.

I don't know if you remember, we've done that before.

Like I kind of quickened the theme and did stuff.

So yeah, Turbo Media Corner, engage.

So listeners of the last episode for 2024 may recall that Jason,

you asked both of us what we thought were like the favourite moments

or like media things that we engaged with last year.

Yeah.

And I gave you no prep.

You had no idea this was coming.

You had about eight seconds to come up with something.

Yes.

So with that episode, we maybe didn't give the best prepared answers.

But upon reflection afterwards, I thought, oh, I should have mentioned this.

And it fits that realm of a Turbo Media Corner.

Listeners may recall, I think I mentioned that last year we were doing this thing.

It was this great gift that Natasha got me.

And we went,

did it as a couple when grandparents were looking after Mac.

We did this kind of weekly thing with the Illawarra Film Society,

where we went to the local Gala cinema and watched new and old movies in this curated calendar.

You basically pay your 99 Australian dollars at the beginning of the year

and go and see a movie every week,

except for the occasional like off week and school holidays and stuff.

And it just didn't even occur to me to bring that up.

And I was super grateful for that gift.

But it was one of my favourite things last year.

And when I reflected on it, it was the kind of ritualistic way that you went to the movies and locked yourself in this room.

Not locked.

I mean, that would be against the fire code.

But you know what I mean?

Like you're in the dark and you just think about this movie.

And I saw some absolutely staggeringly good movies last year.

New and old, as I said, curated by this local film society, which I think is actually the largest in our state of New South Wales.

And I just wanted to say I was super grateful for it.

It was fantastic.

And I know in the past, Jason, correct me if I'm wrong.

You've said that you're less.

Less fussed on the cinema these days.

Is that right?

Or like you prefer to watch movies at home?

Or what's your kind of.

Well, it's more the chains you avoid.

Like you don't like that whole thing.

Yeah.

It's more the chain thing.

I think it's just so.

It's just exhausting.

And it's usually not a good experience.

We do have a local theatre here, the Hollywood Theatre, which if anybody knows anything about the area, they probably have heard of it.

But they have something.

Similar to kind of think what you're talking about, where they have these like film classes is probably not the right term for it, but they do these collections of films based on some kind of theme that they are trying to like effectively teach you through cinema, some kind of concept or whatever it is.

And it sounds kind of similar to that, where you kind of buy this package of films and then they kind of go through the motions of, you know, you watch the film.

You discuss the film and there's this sort of.

It's like a class.

It's like a film class.

And it sounds kind of similar to what you're talking about.

But I think these kind of which are very hard to find now.

Like if you can find like an indie kind of cinema, good luck.

But they do new movies.

They do old movies.

They do like big 70 millimeter, you know, actual film and that kind of stuff.

So it's a it's it's it's not only a theatre.

It's about film preservation.

It's tied to.

A store called Movie Madness that is like they have something like 100,000 movies for that.

You can go and rent.

Wow.

You can rent out a small theatre there.

So it's this whole idea of like appreciation of film and giving you the opportunity to to to really enjoy it.

And I think the way that it was really meant to be enjoyed versus this sort of, you know, stadium style thing that movie.

Theaters have become.

Yeah.

Cram them in.

Yeah, exactly.

Yeah.

But yeah, I just wanted to bring it in.

Not not to bore people about the specific movies that maybe I went to see, although I will mention that I really enjoyed seeing.

I had never actually watched it before.

They had singing in the rain.

Oh, as one of the last movies of the whole season.

And I'm glad that I never watched that movie before seeing it at the cinema because it was glorious on the cinema screen.

I thought it was unbelievably good.

So people are going, wow, Martin, that came out many decades.

Ago.

You're a bit late to the party.

That's fine.

I don't care because I got to see it how it was intended rather than on TV.

Would have been fun on that.

I'm sure.

But it was great to see it there.

And lots of other cool movies like there was one called All of Us Strangers, which I thought was particularly fascinating.

And what else was there?

There was a great one.

It was this really kind of bizarre Finnish romantic comedy that was in many ways not terribly funny, at least in the traditional sense, called Fallen Leaves, which Natasha really disliked.

But I loved.

Anyway, I won't go.

I'll get into it over the top.

I'll actually include a photo of like both sides of this mega program.

If anyone's interested to see some movie recommendations, we could put that in the show notes.

But I wanted to bring this up just to encourage people, as you kind of already have, Jason, maybe to go to the smaller cinemas, check out local stuff, because you'll probably get cheaper tickets or at least discounts or classes or film societies to engage with.

And you can enjoy media or new and old movies in a way that's separate from just the annoying noise and commentary.

Yeah.

And away from the pressure of subscriptions.

Like I said, this was a subscription for a year for $99, but it was $99 to go and enjoy a lot of movies in person and kind of bump into people if you wanted to talk to them.

You could just go and be private if you wanted to.

So get out there, you know, get a cheap movie ticket, go and engage with someone or somewhere locally and get out of like, I suppose, the Disney Plus or Netflix churn for a second if you want.

Yeah.

And there's never going to be more.

Small theaters.

Like, I just, I don't think so.

We had one very close to our house that unfortunately burned down, which like, it's not going to come back.

There's no, there's just no way that's going to happen.

It was like a little, I think there was three screens, very small, intimate theaters.

Those aren't coming back.

So like, enjoy them while you can.

And you were talking about kind of the package thing.

It went something that I just, I don't know.

I think it's interesting.

That place I mentioned, Movie Madness, they have this, this wall of, is it Academy Awards?

Is that the like best picture of the year?

Yeah.

Like Oscars, Academy Awards.

Yeah.

Yeah.

They have a wall of basically every movie that's won since the very beginning, like 1938 or whatever.

So they have every movie that's won in that year on an entire wall.

And I now have like, it's not really a challenge.

It's just something I want to do.

I want to go.

I want to go and actually watch them like one after the other.

And just because many of them, you know, probably the majority of them I've never seen, especially going back to the thirties.

But that just seems like a really cool traversal through history to see, you know, what did everybody think was like the movie in 1942 or 1986 or whatever.

So those kinds of things just don't exist in very many places.

So if you find something cool like that or something very kind of, you know, unique and special, like try to utilize it as much as you can.

Absolutely.

And that wall, I'll end on this point, at least personally, like that wall is similar to this program I'm talking about that I'm going to share in the show notes.

It's a type of curation by a person that makes you motivated to actually go and discover something new.

They say that these things like, you know, the once iTunes, now Apple TV store with its front page or the Netflix home screen or whatever.

That they're curated.

Yeah, they're curated in the sense that people directed what's there.

But it's to overwhelm and suck you into this never ending swiping of selection of stuff at home.

It's not like someone going, here's the thing that you're going to come and engage with and sit down and watch it.

It's curation for capture.

Yeah.

It's curation for capture.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So, you know, actually just go with someone else's recommendations and roll with the program.

That's it.

I'm stoked to go watch more movies now.

Let's see.

I guess if we're staying in media area.

I think this might be interesting to a few people.

Maybe you included.

Well, this is not a turbo anymore, is it?

This is like a mega media corner.

It's like a media media corner.

We've undone ourselves.

But we're not actually mentioning the actual media.

So, it's like a media adjacent corner, I guess.

Wow.

But just come up with new corners all the time.

Whatever.

Go for it.

There are so many holes.

This is like the Swiss cheese of shows.

It's the media hole.

Media hole.

Media hole.

Media hole.

I have decided that I'm going to.

I have decided to completely throw away all of my music in Apple Music.

And I'm going to start from scratch and rebuild my music library with only DRM-free, paid-for MP3s, whatever the file format is.

That's irrelevant.

I don't really care.

But just music that I have on a thing somewhere that I can play on basically any device whenever.

I want.

And I've already found out this is going to be a very big undertaking.

I have a lot of old MP3s from back in, god, who knows, the 90s, I guess.

And some of them are far lesser quality than I would appreciate to have.

Because back then, turns out, disk space was very expensive back then.

So, when you ripped a CD, 96K was pretty good, considering you had like a 20 megabyte hard drive or whatever.

But.

But nowadays, you know, storage is effectively free.

I mean, it's not free, but it's a lot more free than it used to be.

So, I am now taking this task on.

I'm trying to hand curate, you know, think file folders, files, hand moving, doing the MP3 information by hand if needed.

A lot of manual work, I think, is going to go into this.

And it's probably going to be annoying, but I'm hopeful.

That out the other end, I will have a very nice music library that I can listen to anywhere at any time.

What do you think about that?

I think it's a great idea.

It's something that I've tried in a similar sense before.

And I don't say that, like, I've tried this before as an idea before you or foreboding.

It doesn't work.

It kind of depends on how you're sharing things or listening to things or what your listening context is.

So, I've done it before.

I actually.

I've sectioned or cut my Mac off from the syncing library feature to have only my music on it for when I was sitting down and I wanted, like, purposeful listening.

And that works to a degree.

A lot of the time, we have shared playlists or things that are based on Apple Music.

Like, this is between Natasha and me and stuff for Mac.

Like, he has his own little faves playlist that he requests in the car.

So, we've shot ourselves in the foot a bit there subscription-wise that all of these things are shared and rely on that.

But I've come to accept.

That fate a bit and go, you know what?

It's fine to have that ongoing subscription service to share with people or for certain contexts and to have an ongoing iPod or, you know, a Mac or some device that you carry everywhere that is just that thing.

And I think the real key to the success of this is being willing to let that be smaller.

Because if you try to replicate everything and make it what it was on Apple Music or Spotify or whatever you use, it's suddenly just going to become the same thing all over again.

But with the stress of having to manage it.

Whereas you go.

Well, do I actually listen to all of those things?

No, make it the favorites.

So, I'm not telling you how to do it.

But I do think that there's more success in, as you say, stripping back and finding what's actually enjoyable or meaningful in that library.

And then deciding the device that you actually want to listen to or take it with you.

I just, I find that I have this, like, abundance blindness where I have an infinite number of songs.

I have an infinite number of movies.

I have an infinite number of TV shows.

Yeah.

So, it kind of wraps back around on itself to be like, who cares about any of it?

It's just way too much.

Whereas if I can be more purposeful and actually just, you know, get an album, rip it and, like, listen to it.

Like, that just.

Yeah.

It's similar to me, like, when you live somewhere for a while and there are, like, touristy things that are actually probably pretty cool.

But you sort of fall into that.

Like, I live here.

I can go there anytime.

And then you found out, you know, flash forward, you've lived there 20 years and you never went there because you always could.

Oh, such a shame they closed it.

Why didn't anyone go there?

Oh, it's gone now.

Like, why?

Oh, we should have went.

Yeah, well, we should have went 20 years ago when we first said we were going to go.

And that's what this media feels like now to where it's like, oh, I'll get to it eventually.

And it's the same thing.

Oh, that's not on this streaming service anymore.

Or five of the 18.

Songs are, like, not in your jurisdiction anymore.

Whatever.

Like, I'm just done with that.

I don't want that anymore.

It's going to be an experiment.

It's going to take a while.

But I really want to give it a solid go and be like, you know, this is my music.

This is what I can listen to and see where I go.

Yeah.

And it's actually a very similar discussion of what we were just having in the bit that we did about cinema a short time ago, where it's you have these streaming services.

That give you abundance and instant convenience and access to this mega library.

But how much of it can you actually feasibly watch or enjoy?

Same sort of thing with music.

I think the thing that's challenging about music is that we have even more emotional connections to songs generally or certain artists.

And it's more portable.

A song generally takes four to five minutes max a lot of the time versus a movie that might be 90 minutes or two and a half hours or something.

So we feel this maybe I maybe I'm speaking myself, this greater importance placed on.

I want to take my music with me because it's personal and it's in my ears.

Video and movies you can't necessarily consume as conveniently or personally all the time.

Right.

So I think maybe, you know, go into your music app or whatever you use, Jason, and just find most played or something.

Determine it that way or you probably have a system for this already.

You've probably thought about it extensively.

But, yeah, all these other things, you keep them and appreciate them for what they are.

Find and have instant access to anything you want.

But if it's what you really care.

I agree with you.

You want to have that actual copy of your own stuff that you can fall back on if the Internet's not working or for some reason these two songs of an album are no longer available in your region.

Perfect.

I have to give this example.

We we just went camping recently on the middle of nowhere and we have Apple Music in our in the car.

They we have like the Apple Music app, not like streaming from the phone, but just like in the car, whatever.

I don't know.

It's installed in the car.

So great.

That's cool.

That means like it's easier to kind of manage that because I don't have to.

And it switches between profiles.

So like if I'm in my car profile, like it shows my Apple account.

And if if if Valerie's on hers, it shows hers.

So that's all great.

But we're driving out to the middle of nowhere.

So as you can imagine, cell signal starts dipping down.

We go four bars, three bars, two bars, one bar.

And there's always parts of the trip where it's like, well, we have the music is just gone now until we get signal again.

And then we'll get like a bar or two back and it'll kind of start to play and then it'll stop.

And then we get to where we're going and there's no cell signal.

So now I have no music whatsoever.

And it's just this dependence of like having to be connected that just, you know, I guess you could argue being out in the middle of the woods.

Like, well, you shouldn't be listening to, you know, digital music.

Like, OK, whatever.

Like, however, like off grid you want to get.

But if we're out in a cabin in the middle of nowhere.

Like having some music play in the background is nice.

And if I can't do that because I'm not connected to the Internet, like that sucks.

So that just kind of reinforced.

Yeah, it just it just doesn't.

I don't know.

I guess I'm I'm getting into a weird like anti connectedness rant now.

But long story short, music library blown it away.

Start from scratch.

I'm trying out.

I forget what the app is called now.

Somebody I think on our discord recommended it to me of a like.

Music player standalone thing that just plays like your files.

So it's like what iTunes was in 1995.

So that should be comments that say Apple didn't do it then.

But sorry, I'm just getting jumping on that first.

Yep.

Yep.

So, yeah, new music in 2025.

I hope to get it to a point to where I can then just start building it.

But I would be curious for people listening.

Like, what do you do for getting music now?

Like.

Everybody listens to streaming stuff now.

But if you want to get actual files that aren't DRM that you own, it feels like just getting a CD and ripping it is still maybe the best way to go.

I don't know.

But I would be curious if anybody has like I got a couple replies on Mastodon with some ideas.

But if you're hearing my voice in your ears right now, what do you do to get DRM free music nowadays?

Like outside of stealing it?

Like, how do you buy it is really what I'm asking.

Let us know.

Let us know.

And maybe Andrew has thoughts on this for a future follow up, because we all know that he has a spreadsheet for something.

I'm sure that he has a spreadsheet for the songs that do and don't make the cut.

I would imagine.

Yeah, he must.

And not to mention, I bought this album back in 2002 or 2002.

Yeah.

How much is it depreciated over time?

Am I getting value from my listening?

These are the this is what we're lacking by not having Andrew.

This is the business that is not presence on the episode.

We don't know how much an album is costing us per week.

Yeah.

At this point.

No idea.

Relative to the number of listens that you actually.

It's just.

Andrew, we miss you.

Come on back.

If I can, I would like to just end on an up note, if that's OK.

Do you mind if I end on a crescendo?

Yep.

New stickers for 2025.

Hemispheric views shop.

They will be available very soon.

Hemispheric views dot com slash shop to find the new one of the new stickers for 2025.

Everybody loves stickers.

Check out the show.

That's all I had.

I think that's good.

Double trouble.
