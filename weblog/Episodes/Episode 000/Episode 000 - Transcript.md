Hello, and welcome to Lounge Ruminator. I'm your host, Martin Feld. Great to have you
on this week. Today is a very special episode. It's a bit of an experiment of online friends
from the site micro.blog. So I'm joined by the fantastic Andrew Canyon and also equally
fantastic. Jason Burke, how are you both today?
Excellent. Really good. This is Andrew and this is so cool. It's something we've been
trying to get together for quite some time and we're actually here. We're defying all
the international timeline challenges, aren't we?
Absolutely. Yeah. And the time could not be more perfect at 6am in the morning.
Yeah. I'm really grateful that you got up and I felt bad because I was causing difficulties
before we even got here. And look, just to give some context for listeners at home, Andrew,
Jason and I, we all met on micro.blog, which is a fantastic, how would you sort of put
it? It's sort of a social networking blog, micro blogging site. And it's sort of what,
an alternative to Twitter, would you say these days?
Yeah, it's almost an alternative to Twitter and WordPress and Facebook and Instagram even.
You can host a podcast there.
It does a bit of everything.
Jason, you're pretty.
You.
Yeah, I mean, I would say it's, it's, it used to only be what I thought was a
alternative to Twitter, but over time, things just keep getting added and it's
becoming kind of a central, I mean, I hate to say it, but almost an AOL where you
kind of are starting to get a lot of different things in one place, which
generally is scary because you start getting too many things and it just gets
overwhelming. But so far, everything has seemed to work out with with micro blog in terms of what
it's able to do and what it's able to offer. It's not for everyone yet. I still think that it's
takes a special kind of person to to jump in and be able to take on some of the difficulties and
challenges with something like micro blog. But overall, I could not be happier with with what
it's brought to me personally.
Like you were just saying how we met through that service, which sounds weird still to
say.
But I can just say that Jason, when I first joined up, I don't know if you remember this,
but you posted me in snail mail, like some micro.blog stickers.
And it was just amazing.
I was like, what on earth?
This is amazing.
What a friendly, what a friendly place.
And I stand by the fact that it is the friendliest place on the internet.
And you keep waiting for like, yeah, this is just a facade, you know, because surely
the internet's a horrible cesspit.
We all know that.
When's the, when are the real people going to show up?
But no, it's just nice.
Yeah.
And you're right about it being friendly because ultimately it's what has led to this today.
So for the listeners at home, a bit of context here.
We've been chatting together for some time on micro.blog and it really is friendly.
is free of, I suppose, likes, follower counts, and so on. And so it really breeds this environment
of, well, if you want to interact with people, you have to respond to them. Andrew and Jason,
you two really are people who've been very active and very kind in responding to me.
So I suppose this is really the audio experiment version for that extended communication.
Yeah, I really appreciate the fact that it's not just click a button. At first,
it was a little off-putting like, "Oh, I gotta do all this work of typing words. Oh gosh."
But at the end of the day, it really, if you care, you will write something versus just clicking
something. Because clicking a thumb or a star or whatever doesn't really mean anything. But
even if you just write two words back to somebody, the amount that that person gets from that is just
exponentially higher. >> I agree. It's really great. And the people behind it
really care.
Like it's a small business essentially owned and operated by a guy who I think got sick
of the social media world as it was, and he's really passionate about it and he's working
hard.
So, and of course you have to pay.
There is a free element that you can feed into it, but to get all the hosting stuff,
you do have to give money.
And I think as soon as money changes hands, it changes the premise.
And your intent on why you're there.
I mean, if you can just put in a name and a crappy password and now you have an account,
what's your commitment to that?
Whereas if you're putting three, four or five dollars on the line, that means you're actually
there on purpose.
Yeah, you're not so much the product, you are actually using a product that you intend
to pay for.
And I mean, and there are questions about access and stuff and whether it maybe discourages
people from signing up.
But really, I mean, regardless, it leads to an environment where, as you say, there's
an intention to actually interact with people, not just give up likes and button presses
that lead to data just somewhere for someone else.
That's what sort of brought us together.
And I suppose, I mean, Andrew, I've had you on the show before, and we discussed a lot
about, I think you called it your potted computing history, and that was a lot of fun.
So what would you both like to sort of kick off discussing today?
I mean, it's that general interest that we share in technology that's brought us here,
I suppose.
I think it has.
I remember on our podcast we talked all sorts of computer stuff and then I think Jason you
chimed in on micro.blog we were talking about it and we thought we've all got this same
interest and background and we're really all a bunch of Mac nerds at the heart of it all
aren't we?
And so what the world needs, what the world needs is another podcast with three dudes
talking about computers.
I don't think there is one.
I mean it's really, this must be really unique.
I can't think of any tech podcasts that have three white males talking about computers.
I don't think it exists.
No, no, no.
It's unique.
Yeah.
New ground.
We're cutting new ground.
We could talk about windows, uh, somehow.
I don't know.
I don't know where I would do that, but we could try.
I felt a bit ill then, but if you really want to.
I have to go get my, I have to go get my tie, put my shirt and tie on.
We can talk windows.
Oh man.
No, let's not do that.
I think I want to ask about, because the first thing on the list here is BOS.
I really got to find out about other people.
Did other people you guys actually know about BOS?
That was mentioned in the podcast with Martin.
I still have the book that's probably about five inches thick and the CDs with BOS, whatever
version on it.
And I tried so hard.
I mean, who knows?
This was years and years and years ago.
I tried so hard to make that my operating system.
Uh, this was back when I used windows way, way, way back in the day when
there really wasn't anything else.
Um, I mean, yes, there's Linux.
There's always been Linux, but BOS was like, it's, I guess it was what.
Mac iOS.
I, in my head, what I thought computers should be, this was before I was on Mac
OS.
So BOS was like, Oh, this is, it's beautiful.
It's well, it's well laid out.
Everything about it just is it's enjoyable to use.
And it never went anywhere, so fortunately I found Mac OS and everything was good from
there on out.
But oh God, I wanted that to work so bad.
It reminds me absolutely of web OS, which was from Palm.
I was a diehard web OS fan user.
I made it.
I, that was the first app I ever wrote was for web OS.
I truly thought like this is the future apps that are written in web code.
things, web, oh, it's so exciting. And honestly, the hardware, awesome, everything about it
was great. The software I thought was fantastic as well. But again, just I don't know, wrong
place, wrong time or what, but it kind of was BOS all over again.
So for people who are listening who have no familiarity with either of those, what were
the things about BOS and webOS at the time that were so different or that motivated you
or made you think this is the future?
The the I mean, mostly user interface.
I don't think at the time anyone really knew or cared about what was under the hood.
I mean, kind of like today, I don't think anybody truly cares.
Well, I mean, some people do, but you know how much memory you have or what hard.
Who cares? Right.
It's like, what am I actually interacting with as a person?
What am I touching?
And BOS, it was from the installation to the startup
to just the interaction with the UI, it felt like you weren't using a computer in the traditional
sense of a, you know, big iron computer of sitting at the command line and banging away at the
keyboard. It was more of a enjoyable experience of getting things accomplished. And the same for
webOS, where everything was very whimsical and fun, and you wanted to use it. You know, this was
well before, you know, everybody was addicted to cell phones, and we can't put them down now.
This was all still very new, so it made you want to pick it up and interact with it.
Um, even down to things like the hardware where you would, this was when it.
Wireless charging back before that was even really a thing and it would
just magnet nicely to the dock.
And it just, everything felt so good compared to what was out there.
You know, using a Palm trio, which was weighed four pounds and had a giant
keyboard on it and a stylus with a pen.
You had a jab at the screen.
This was just nice and fluid.
Wow.
I don't think we ever really got the web OS over here in Australia very much.
I remember reading about it a little bit, but I don't know if it ever even really made
it to market over here.
Probably not.
I mean, as most things come out of Silicon Valley and they're very popular there and
then it remains to be seen if they make it anywhere else.
Yeah, it's funny.
Some things take off earlier in Australia through experimentation.
Like I think Australia, New Zealand, we have the claim to fame for McAfee.
So Australians are very quick to jump on McDonald's coffee, but no, we don't get the cool operating
systems.
That's unfortunate.
But you guys get the first iPhones too, I think, right?
Isn't it the very first one usually opens there, I think?
Yeah, I think it might be New Zealand.
Does New Zealand get it first?
Because they're a little bit further away than we are.
Yeah, I think they just beat us.
That's right.
I mean, Australia and New Zealand, we're sort of early adopters with some things.
I think we've reached, what, 99% Apple pay penetration because we have lower bank competition
And there are just tap.
Well, because basically there are four big banks in Australia.
They shall not be named because they just went through a royal commission.
Excuse me.
And that just meant that they rolled out wireless payment terminals everywhere.
So they just flick a switch and essentially Apple pays everywhere.
So we might have missed out on earlier things, but there are some things
that make us a tech utopia, I suppose.
Is that right, Andrew?
Yeah, like literally I haven't used cash.
I mean, especially with COVID now, you know, people sort of look at cash
as you don't use that because it's dirty.
But really, I had a $20 note sitting in my wallet
for probably two months.
It was tap and go with everything.
You know, I bought a coffee today, you buy a coffee, tap and go.
You buy a parking ticket for a parking meter, tap and go.
It's all, it's everywhere.
Yeah, it's sort of jarring to not have it.
I think I've been using Apple Pay consistently for five years.
And like you, I have a $20 note occasionally in my wallet
it's exclusively for haircuts because where I go they won't accept a card payment and it's just
this every four weeks I know that I'm going to have to pull some grimy rectangle out of my wallet.
Apple Pay is one of the most overlooked, well not overlooked, but just I guess assumed to be there
so it's not exciting. But that service has, that is actually a life-changing service if you ask me.
I mean, it's very basic. It's very, maybe it's just not exciting, but wow. When, when Apple pay
happens, I will specifically search out places to use Apple pay. I will shop at other places
because of Apple pay. And that is just huge that you could never say that about a, you know,
every company has their own little, you know, card for loyalty and all that. I would never switch
stores because their loyalty card was better. But if they don't have Apple pay and their
competitor does, I'm gone. That is just, it's so much better, especially with now tied to
the Apple card too. It's like 3% back for Apple stuff to, you know, all the, whatever
it has, it's just so simple. And I think it got a lot of flack when it came out. Like,
Oh, Apple's doing a credit card. They should be making better computers, whatever. I personally
have found it to be absolutely delightful to use that combination.
And that's the irony though is that we have all this infrastructure and got the Apple
Pay but we don't actually have the Apple branded credit card.
So everything we have it links back to our national, the banks we have in Australia but
we don't have an option to get the Apple product, the Apple card.
Do you use Apple Pay online too or just like terminals?
Yes. Online. Yeah, online as well. I totally understand Jason's standpoint about going to
places that support Apple Pay, because I actually switched banks when it came out to get Apple Pay.
I mean, I jumped ship to get onto it, so I'm totally on board with that.
I would have if I had to. Luckily, I happened to be with the right bank when I launched it.
Which is crazy, right? Like, when has there ever been something that made you want to switch
banks or when has anyone ever cared about what bank they had? This has to be the first time that
that's ever been the case. It's a really good point. Yeah, it shows how transformative it has
been and just how, I mean, a really successful technology affects your behavior and the way that
you sort of live your every day. So I totally agree with you there. The last thing they ever
had as a bank was, you know, when everybody switched to quote unquote free checking, which,
you know, just saying the word check feels horrific at this point. So this is a pretty big deal.
Checking. Yeah. Wow. That's going back in time. That is a long and distant past.
Thankfully, I remember having to learn how to write checks in high school or whatever it was.
It was like, this is how you write it down. You have to write the number in. I was like, what?
Now, I sort of derailed us there with Apple Pay, but I'm glad that we have two huge Apple Pay
advocates on here. But I suppose steering back if you want to back to the sort of OS discussion,
because we're talking about BOS and web OS. For both of you, how did that sort of steer into
Mac OS eventually? For me, Mac OS, the very, I guess my first, I'm trying to think back to exactly
when it actually happened. But I do fondly remember going into XYZ computer store, or
whatever it was called back then, and seeing the titanium power book next to the sea of
other Windows laptops that were 17 inches thick and disgusting, and seeing this titanium power
book and seeing the price of it also in comparison back then was like, "Okay, why is it so much? What
what does it do?
Surely it must do something amazing for that price.
And just seeing it and having the hinge open perfectly
and the track pad and the keyboard felt amazing,
that sold me.
So it was hardware first, which makes sense
because you're gonna see it before you use it.
And then using it at first, I mean, honestly,
it was like, what is this?
This is, is this like, it looked like candy, right?
Which was a good thing 'cause it brought you in.
So that that led me down to thinking, well, this is kind of BOS II in a way.
And what is this?
And then as soon as I started using that in the store, it was like, oh, well, this
is over with my, if, if only I had known how much my life would change and how
much I would spend on Apple products going forward throughout my life.
Uh, I, I, I probably should have stopped and never looked at it, but you know,
I'm, I'm glad I did.
You should have bought the stock and not the computer.
Always.
Yeah, for sure.
But it's a terrifying figure, isn't it? I mean, now I hate to think how much of a bill
this is racking up now that we've got, you know, monthly subscriptions to what Apple
Music, iCloud, whatever you happen to subscribe to. So it's beyond the hardware now, and it's
just all manner of charges constantly flying out.
I would love a clock on my wall with just a running total. I think that would be great.
The scary thing is I'm a YNAB fanatic. So I could probably actually look it up. I could
probably do a search and quickly tell you how much I've paid to Apple, but I'm not going
to do it. I refuse. But it is like lock-in, but I look around sometimes I think, is this
still the right thing for me? Is Apple Music still what I should be using? Or maybe I ditch
it altogether or I go to Spotify. And every time I do that, I still come back and say,
"Nah, even if it's a little bit more expensive, I don't feel like I'm being compelled to be
locked in. I feel like I'm still being locked in by choice.
>> Brian Kardell I would agree with that. Yeah, I think the
whole lock-in discussion, I find it somewhat infuriating. I don't know, it's probably super
controversial but I'm going to go there anyway. It's a choice. You know, it's not Apple, as
of today, whatever day we're recording, Apple doesn't run the world. You know, it's not
a state-sponsored OS that you must use. It seems like there's a new issue every day of
of people being locked into this or that or the other thing.
But at the end of the day, you're not really locked in.
I could get rid of all of my Apple stuff today
and switch to pick another thing, and that's fine.
I could go get a--
wow, how embarrassing.
I forget what they're called.
What's the Surface?
I could go get a Surface.
I could pick a phone that you want.
And I could do basically all the same stuff
with just different applications.
So there's really, it's not as if my, you know,
my contact list is not in Apple format.
And if I try to leave, they will delete all my contacts.
No, that's not how it is.
I think I'm probably oversimplifying things quite a bit.
And obviously I'm on the wrong side of the argument,
judging by what's in front of me right now.
But I just, I don't see there being a major issue
at this point, and I know there are many people,
and I apologize, Martin, for all the feedback
you're gonna get on this, that disagree with that,
but I just, I am not finding a super persuasive argument
as to this lock-in at this point.
I think it is a choice.
Am I locked in?
Yes.
Do I wanna be at this point?
Yes, I do.
Are things, quote, more expensive?
I don't think so, because I think you can't just equate
a dollar to the actual product itself.
You have to, like most things,
I don't think people value their time enough.
They don't assign a dollar value to their time.
And that's one of the biggest problems with a lot of areas.
So when I buy a laptop for X, you know,
say it's $3,000 and it's like,
well, I could have got a Windows laptop for 400.
Yes, that's absolutely true.
And if that works for you, that's great.
But for me personally, that extra few dollars,
whatever it is, the things that I can get done
with that hardware and software, I enjoy it more,
I get it done quicker, and at the end of the day,
I'm not chasing down stupid bugs and issues
with things that don't work because, you know,
and another thing that it's, it just works for me.
Maybe I'm a rare unicorn in the Mac world,
but things generally always work for me
when it comes to Mac and iOS.
I think a lot of the issues people have get amplified crazily out of proportion.
But for me, things just work.
I don't know about you guys, but that's my impression.
Look, I mean, I agree with pretty much everything that you said, Jason.
I think that term lock-in, I mean, it is a sort of dramatic or emotive term.
People are locked in in the sense that maybe they have a certain fandom or there's an attachment
to the computer and they feel like if they leave, they're missing out on something.
But I like that sort of term that you used where it's not like a, I think you said state
sponsored or run OS.
Yeah, yeah.
It's a there is no, there's no implied force that this is your only option.
Yeah, exactly.
So really, I mean, I'm using this platform because I really enjoy it.
It sounds like it's the same for both of you.
I mean, sure, if I were to move somewhere else, I would feel probably a bit antsy or
uncomfortable and I'd, I'd missed out on things.
And maybe some things wouldn't transfer over in the same way.
But yeah, like you said, I mean, it is a bit of a cliche, but I do feel that it just works.
I turn things on, they're speedy, I never have any issues.
I've never had anything in the way of, you know, malware or viruses, although of course
it is possible to get it on any computing platform.
I've never had to rebuild anything or had any massive data loss.
And I've been using Macs since I was a kid, nonstop.
Exposure to the Windows world, of course, and, you know, obviously, stuff like Android
with smartphones, you always got to keep an eye on what's out there.
But, you know, I think it's just a matter of finding the device that works for you.
And if it gels with your workflow or your process, just be happy with it.
It's when you start to see anti-fandom or hatred for certain interests
that I think it gets a bit rabid.
You know, we can be critical.
We can look for alternatives.
We can be analytical and sort of make sure that we criticize
what companies like Apple are doing.
But if you enjoy it, I think go for it.
Absolutely.
And it's your perspective as well, right?
I mean, I'm a nerd.
I dabble in everything.
Do I?
Would I call myself a, you know, a developer?
No, I wouldn't.
If I was a developer, I may have some different opinions
on the way things are working right now.
You know, when you look at how apps are distributed on, let's say, the iPhone
where it's, you know, I want to be able to sideload.
I personally don't.
You know, I've done the whole Android thing of sideloading and all that.
For me, it doesn't matter.
For some it might, but that's why there's choices.
If that's very important to you, there are options for you.
Again, the iPhone is not the only phone for me.
I think the big thing is that it is a, it's an, it's a choice.
I have chosen to be here.
And at any time I can leave, do I have a massive commitment to this brand now?
Yeah, I've put a ton of money and a ton of time into it, but that all that being
said, I still can leave if I want to.
I was going to say that probably if you boiled it all down, there's about three basic things
that keep me on the Mac, really.
If there was, I mean, there's lots of things I like about it, but these are the three things
if you said, take these away, maybe.
It would be quick look.
Love it.
I use quick look.
You know, you hit the space bar and a big preview of the thing comes up.
Windows does not have that.
And I don't know how people can live without that.
In terms of just quickly checking, is this the right thing, is it not the right thing,
live with that thing.
Launch bar, where you command space and you can navigate folders, directories and things
to get somewhere quickly.
Again, nothing like that that I know of on Windows and you use that and people look over
your shoulder and they think you're just a magician.
That's how I get around my computer.
So I need that, otherwise I'm sort of very much hamstrung.
And the third one is I can't deal with the stupid janky touchpad things that they put
on Windows machines.
I don't know what it is about how they build PCs, but they have never come close to the
touchpad experience that Macs have.
And they're usually terrible, unresponsive, they click when you don't want to click them.
Those are three things that are totally non-negotiable.
The trackpad's a good one.
It's like, it's kind of like the Apple Pay thing where it's there and people, it's just,
you know, it's not really an exciting feature, but oh my gosh, there's never, their track
pads are just, they nail it every single time.
I've used other track pads, I've used them all.
The Surface ones are okay, but yeah, the MacBook track pad is in a true, truly in a league
of its own.
It's the fact that something can be designed to feel so natural.
It's something that you no longer think about.
And then when you are confronted with something that is clunky or janky, like you said, it
suddenly removes that illusion of using the computer like it's an extension of your hands.
It's so forgiving too, where you don't have to think about how you're using it.
You know, you can have three, four, five fingers on there.
It doesn't matter because when you go to do the two finger, it just, it somehow it just
works, which I'm now back to the just works thing again, but it does.
I don't have false clicks.
I don't, I don't, I'm amazed at their trackpads.
And that's why I'll pay hundreds of dollars more for a Mac computer, because that's my
frustration that I'm going to be dealing with every day.
If that thing doesn't work nicely, because I tried to save $300 on a purchase price,
not worth it.
Not worth it at all.
Andrew, you mentioned LaunchBar.
Martin, do you use, I mean, I'm sure you do, some kind of launchy type thing.
Which one do you use?
Actually I'm very boring.
I stick to default spotlight.
I don't know if that's sacrilege, but I've always just stuck with that.
No, I've, I fully, it used to not be great,
but nowadays it does everything you really need to do.
I go back and forth as well, but yeah, that one it's built right in.
I think it's because of my work. I deal with a lot of different clients.
So I'm in and out of client files. And I think I just, I,
I think about them by that. So I quickly searched by the client,
but then I'll need to traverse,
'cause I'm like a bit of a directory builder.
So I traverse their directories, you know,
after I search just with my arrow keys
and then find the file that I'm interested in,
maybe quick look it, maybe open it.
Yeah, it's all just done with the keyboard.
So I don't spotlight, I'll use occasionally,
but I'm always a little bit underwhelmed by it.
- So you find that using LaunchBar for search
throughout your system just gives you some more granular
search terms or abilities.
Yeah, because you can search for it, then you can act on it.
So you can either drill into it or show me more details.
Or if I'm looking up somebody in my address book and I just want to see their phone number,
you can find them with LaunchBar, an arrow across and showing me their phone number.
Now I know Spotlight can probably do all that, but I guess it's just so ingrained in me in
the LaunchBar way now, after all these years, it's just that's the way that I think.
And again, Spotlight can do this, but every application I load is basically a quick couple
of keys and load Safari or load Mailmate or whatever it might be.
And all my searching is done, if I start a DuckDuckGo search or a Google search, it's
a quick tap tap, a shortcut for Geo for Google or DD for DuckDuckGo.
And then you type your search term into the launch bar itself, and then push enter and
it opens a browser window and does it.
>> It's funny how you mentioned looking like a magician because it really does feel that
way.
I've mostly at work, I would notice things like this at different jobs where I've always
been that guy with the Mac, you know, or it's just always that way.
But you would, you know, you're in a meeting, you're connected to a projector, so everybody's
seeing what you're doing.
And it's the two worlds of the person with the Windows laptop is if they can even get
connected to the projector properly.
They're fit, fiddling around with windows, trying to get things, you know,
Oh, press all F seven windows key nine, and then it'll switch desktops or
whatever it's like, okay.
And I'll never remember.
I'll never remember.
I'll never forget some presentation I was doing at some point.
It was, everybody that was there was, was pretty, pretty high up there.
Uh, and I go up and I plug in my Mac book.
and launch keynote and off I'm going.
And about two minutes in, I hear a OK, stop, stop, stop.
And immediately I'm like, oh, dear, like what?
This is supposed to just be everything's good.
I've heard, you know, if slides are good, everything's great.
And it's not going to say who it is, but they said,
what the hell did you just do?
I was like, what the hell?
Going to need a little more information than that.
I'm not exactly sure what I've done wrong here.
And he's like, you just plugged in your laptop and it just worked.
I was like, wow.
Yeah, that's and I'm in my head.
I'm just like, what? Why is he?
What does he what does he want out of this?
Is this just bad humor on his part or what?
What is I don't what? Yeah.
What's the end goal here?
Like, do I leave without a job?
What's going on here?
And he immediately turns over to
one of the IT folks and he's like,
why don't we all have that?
I was like, oh God, this is not good.
Because now IT is looking at me like, yeah, thanks.
Now everyone has to have,
yeah, everyone that's in C-level has to have a MacBook.
It was one of those things where I take it for granted,
I just plug in my thing and it works.
That's how it's supposed to go.
But yeah, anyway, with the magic thing,
it felt like one of those moments like,
how did he get the projector to work?
Oh my gosh, and then you do something like a launch bar sounds like a very successful presentation
Yeah, that was me. I should have just shut it down right there and left
He closed the deal
Done. Yeah, exactly. Is that what you call a Mac drop rather than a microphone? So that's really bad. I
Think it might be yeah, fortunately, I didn't have to give him my laptop. That was my next worry. Oh god, but
Honestly, I don't know what Andrews feeling is on this
But I totally relate to what you're saying about being in inverted commas the Mac guy at work
You just sort of, through some sort of very gentle vibe or suggestion or tone in your voice,
you just sort of ooze this Mac-ness.
And whenever there happens to be a Windows issue, I can't help but characterize it as a Windows issue.
Like if someone says, "I've got a problem here, can you help?"
And I just sort of go, "Oh, this appears to be a dot, dot, dot Windows issue."
And I can't help but just sort of highlight that it's an issue that is not with a Mac.
And I'm like, "God, you can't stop yourself, can you?"
Yeah, at my last job I was at, there was a few of us and we started tracking the time that it took
from meetings to get started because of quote unquote Windows issues. And it was a very
significant amount of time. It was like, see the money you're saving on those laptops,
look where it's going. It's going into people sitting around twiddling their thumbs waiting.
That sounds like we can sort of all revel in our quantified smugness. Is that a good way to put it?
I don't know. Yeah, yeah. It sounds horrible saying it. I'm never going to listen to this
back. But it's true.
I can always cut it if you want, or maybe not, who knows. But on the topic of it just works,
thinking about WWDC this year, and for anyone who doesn't follow the Worldwide Developers
Conference, or all of Apple's keynotes as keenly as we obviously do, everything went online this
year because of the COVID-19 situation, which is dreadful in itself. But all in all, Apple's
pre-recorded keynote format was a total hit, really, really swish, really, really
professionally done, of course. I mean, what, what we, what, what did you two
think of it? What were your impressions and do you follow up and install things
like a betas or betas?
Jason, you, you're like right around the corner, aren't you? We should just, you
know, help people out in terms of geolocating. You're, you're, you're right
near Apple.
I used to be actually, not anymore. I just, we just moved actually out of the
state, but yeah, we were, we, when WWDC was in San Jose, it was about three
minutes from our house. So yeah, we were right there. But now
we're up in we're in Portland, Oregon now. So we're not as
close. But given COVID, we wouldn't be close anyway. But I
think from an event standpoint, I could not be happier with the
way it went. I much, much prefer the tight, well edited video
versus live because for me, I just I don't think you gain you
gain nothing from live if you have the ability to do it
pre-recorded, do it.
Because as everyone knows, every demo,
there's going to be an issue.
Something's going to happen.
And especially with the terrible, trashy news cycles
that we have now, you can have the most amazing announcement
ever.
And you could do a typo in the demo,
and immediately the only thing people are talking about
is a typo.
And it's like-- especially if it's an Apple-related thing.
It just gets amplified because everybody gets clicks and all
of that.
But anyway, back to the actual event, I thought the event was amazing.
I thought they pulled it off really well, especially given the timeframe that they had.
You know, these things are not planned in a week and I'm sure this has been the second
one ends, I'm sure planning for the next one begins.
So having something like a worldwide pandemic thrown into the mix, they pulled it off.
And I think that's, they deserve a lot of credit for being able, especially their events
team to be able to pull off something from a live event with thousands of
people and physical stuff to all online delivering the same messaging.
And from what I could tell, it seemed like interactivity was still pretty
good, all things considered.
I think that's so almost the unsung superpower of Apple is how they can
coordinate all these others.
bits and pieces that aren't directly related to making and selling computers.
But how do you, how do you do the logistics of, you know, first of all, how do you do
logistics of a WWDC and make that happen?
And then how do you go now scratch that we're going to take it all online and we're
going to make it absolutely schmick.
And, you know, it's going to look amazing.
Going to be high quality.
I mean, just managing people to get that to happen is an incredible feat.
And I don't know how they manage it.
More power to them is all those unsung people that never get stage time that make
that stuff happen. Definitely. Amazing. And I think a lot of times people just say,
well, they have all this money, they can do whatever. And it's like,
that's not the point.
All the money in the world does not make something like this happen. Yep. Yeah.
And I think the real thing about WWDC this year,
pandemic topics aside, um,
it's really sort of shows maybe a realization or a shift in view about who the
audience actually is, because naturally, I mean, developers, that's the term that's in
the name of the entire event. It's really traditionally been angled towards developers
because it's about new software developments, APIs, coding stuff that's way beyond my understanding.
But given that Apple has such enormous brand power now, and a global audience, you know,
it's that worldwide point that really sticks out in the name now. Really, the pre-recorded
format now makes it more accessible for people watching at home and much, much tighter, as
you said. So perhaps it's an understanding that the event itself has changed.
I think one indicator of that too is when they started doing public betas, back to where
you brought up the betas, right? Because historically it's always been developer betas and idiots
like me would get an account anyway, so I can install the developer betas on day one
and then not have a phone that works.
But the fact that there are public betas now,
I think speaks a lot to the point of that event.
And I think you're right.
It is a lot more of a,
I think advertisement is the wrong word,
but a way to get people kind of pre-excited,
which is I think something that has to happen now,
where it used to just be,
you would know there was a new iPhone coming in September
and that was enough.
But now in our culture today,
kind of keep needing those little nudges more regularly instead of just one big
nudge. So I think this is just yet another way to say, Hey, here comes some
cool stuff and maybe it matters to you and maybe it doesn't. Obviously all the
API stuff normal people don't care about, but maybe something like the
messages, you know, track back or tap backs and all that. They may, that might
be something that makes somebody think, Hey, maybe I will upgrade my phone this
year, even though I didn't last year.
I just want to ask you a question as well, Martin.
And I'm curious, well, Jason, you'll be able to chime in as well.
I'm curious whether this is an Australian thing or I don't know what.
But I always found, I really liked the switch to video this year.
It was quicker and more dynamic and engaging.
But the one thing that I really noticed and I enjoyed was not having the faux applause
for every little thing.
It feels just that clapping every little bit of announcement always just felt so cheesy.
And forced.
And just unnecessary.
Yeah, and I wonder if that is my Australian sensibilities, or is that, do other people
interpret it that way too?
Oh look, I mean, I think that's a fair thing to say.
I think it's, we're just becoming more and more aware of the format, or maybe another
to put it is seeing the matrix, seeing the illusion. So, you know, back in the time when
it was Steve Jobs, and it was really just him on stage with some, you know, people accompanying him,
it really was like the grand leader walks out on stage and everyone's really enthusiastic and
what's the story going to be this time. But obviously, you know, with his death, and then
more and more people coming out on stage, the entire flavor of the thing changes. And, you know,
there is that whole thing of, you know, Apple, apparently, you know, putting retail people in
the audience to applaud and make it louder. So I think, yeah, I think you're right. It's sort of
the Australian sensibility or I mean, we're a bit more sarcastic or maybe pessimistic,
stereotypically than Americans typically are. I mean, Jason, maybe you could comment on whether
you think that's true or not. But I think that maybe rising levels of applause, the fact that
we've witnessed a shift in the way that the events work, and we're seeing the shift in the way that
they construct them and the number of people they bring out and their sort of pivot to try to have
more diverse people on stage. We're just more, I think, aware of what we're actually seeing and
how it's constructed than what it was in the past. >> I see it as a corporate culture issue,
personally. Having been in the large corporations in the past, you go to an all hands meeting or
whatever, and it's the exact same thing, right? Where there's a person going up there, they're
going to say something. Everyone is obliged to clap whether they think it's great, think it's
horrible, can't stand it. It's just part of the culture that is corporate. And I think this just
kind of bled into that. So I don't know if I see it as anything more than that. I do agree that
it's not needed, much like doing demos live. If you don't have to, don't. Because you can make
that pacing just that much quicker. And I think the points just get across that much better.
Sorry to put you on the spot, Jason, and I am being a bit facetious here. But just given what
what you were saying about corporate culture in America, have you ever felt yourself
clapping spontaneously on command? Yeah, I mean, it's a crowd issue, right? Where
somebody is going to be the first person that does it, obviously, there has to be a first one,
and immediately everyone just jumps right on. It's like the wave at a sporting game, right? Where
somebody starts it and maybe it doesn't go anywhere, but eventually, all of a sudden,
the entire stadium is doing this thing and kind of nobody really knows why, but it's kind of just
because everyone else is doing it. And that's really what that feels like. I don't think there's
any genuine, you know, feeling or emotion behind it. It's just kind of a person said thing. Okay,
must clap. Okay, next. And that's it. Sometimes that's not true. Obviously, you know, if there's,
I don't know if you're doing some kind of appreciation thing or something, but even that
feels forced most of the time in a corporate type world. It's never a spontaneous, "Oh,
you know what? So-and-so did great. Let's give them something." It's always a, it's been planned
for weeks and we're going to say this person's name. Everyone's going to clap. They're going to
get their little award and we'll move on. So I guess back to your thing about being sarcastic,
I'm probably not representative of everyone, but I'm right there.
Okay, good. That's great. Martin, you work for a big Australian company.
I've been in the SME, the small and medium enterprise sector for quite a while now, so
I've divorced myself from big corporations.
What's it like in Australian big corporations these days?
Are we clapping and are we doing that sort of stuff?
Oh look, I mean I think in Australia, like in the US, you always have stereotypes of
things like groupthink or everyone getting on the bandwagon.
the American phrase, drinking the Kool-Aid or something. But I don't really get that vibe too
much where I work. I mean, you know, people certainly believe in what they're there to do.
And, you know, maybe get carried away with ideas sometimes. But yeah, I mean, I do recall one time,
you know, I think working with some Americans on a particular project, and it was actually
very refreshing about how enthusiastic they were about stuff. It was a noticeable difference.
there was a lot of, you know, "Oh, that's awesome. That's just awesome." And I was like,
"You know what? Maybe this is awesome." That I can appreciate. I think that I don't
want to make it sound like, you know, no one should be happy about what they're doing. Because
if you're not happy what you're doing, then maybe try not to do it. But I think genuine
enthusiasm is great. I think it's that forced from the top down where we need satisfaction
amongst our employees and everyone must take a survey and we're going to get all fives this time.
It's like, well, okay, great. You've told me that I have to put a five.
That's not really a survey.
That's not a survey, but good try.
We know how much Tim Cook likes his customer sat. What's the internal employee sat?
Right. That's a really tough thing, especially in Silicon Valley. And I think that's a really
warped view as well of corporate culture. And that's where I've been most of the time
from a corporate standpoint would be in Silicon Valley, but it's a very tough thing for people to
be able to actually speak out because I think it's just a weird job market in the valley where
if you are not happy, it kind of, being very broad here, so obviously this doesn't count for everyone,
but there are 50 other developers willing to take your job for less money. So I think it's
it's really tough for a lot of culture in Silicon Valley to be positive. And I think we see it every
day of just terrible stories coming out of different companies of treatment of people
and so forth. And I think I just took this to a way darker place than it was at previously.
But in terms of the corporate culture thing, I think Silicon Valley has a long way to go
in that regard, and just in terms of people being able to speak up about how they feel about
the way things are going. And to that, I was being a little facetious about the being forced to write
a five, but I think a lot of people really feel like if they criticize where they work,
they will be fired. And it's just, I'm not trying to fix that right now, but
it's just something to keep in mind when we're criticizing large companies that I think a lot,
we try to simplify it down to they're doing a bad thing and they shouldn't do that. And there's just
the nuance level is something so far above anything that anyone can understand.
Recently there was that article of Tim Cook, you know, about his leadership style and so forth.
And I'm sure there'll be a million think pieces about that. And that'll be great to skip in my
RSS. When you're running a large corporation that's yes, based on profits, that's what
companies are. You have to be a certain kind of person and you can't just not care about things
or be nonchalant about whatever. You have to do things a certain way. And that's just
the unfortunate reality we're in. You know, that's the world we live in. If we're going
to have companies like this, these are the kinds of people that need to run them. So
I, I, again, I don't know if I'm really going anywhere with that, but I just, I think there's
this criticism of, of a certain kind of person that people don't understand. And you can't
understand, you can't understand that level in a corporation being even in that corporation
at that level. Yeah. And when it comes to people who rise to the top of digital technology companies,
and we're talking about the sort of companies that you're mentioning in Silicon Valley, not just
Apple, but it could be Google, Facebook, Microsoft, whatever, they are much more than just digital
technology companies. Now, they're essentially, well, they're media companies, they're lifestyle
companies, they're moving into more and more facets of our life. And you do really have to be
aggressive to push that. And as a consumer, it's sort of, I mean, maybe we're circling back to that
whole lock-in thing as well. But yeah, you can move between platforms, but so much of our lives
are now tied into this stuff. So, I mean, what do you both think about that in terms of, I mean,
because I know we sort of set some notes down here before, things like Facebook or other social
networks, I mean, obviously run by controversial or very driven figures. Do you feel like that's
something that's easy to leave? Or what do you think that sort of, what role does that play in
people's lives now. I think there's a perception that it's difficult to leave
is strong. The actual reality of being able to leave is actually not so bad, at
least in my own experience. I ditched Facebook probably a year ago, maybe a bit
more, and I realized I don't miss it. I do not miss that place, one iota. And
there was a time just a few months ago when for some reason I had to go to a
a Facebook page I was linked to it or something.
So I ended up on the site.
I hadn't been there for ages.
And I thought, "Oh, I'm just going to have a look.
Just let me scroll through."
And literally there was nothing there that was important.
And you realize this is just all junk.
And it used to be that in the early days of Facebook, people would actually write stuff.
They would write their own thoughts or write what they'd done for the day or what have
you.
It was more like a mini blog or something.
Now all anybody ever does is just share stuff.
And so you end up with just this wreck, just pages and pages of just junky stuff that people
share, bad jokes, memes, news articles that I don't care about, political perspectives
that I don't want to see.
It's just yuck, and you gain nothing from it.
And by quitting it, you gain a lot of time back.
From Facebook's point of view, easy to get rid of.
with Instagram, I sort of, I got rid of that and sort of didn't miss it.
And then loaded it.
I was like, you know, some friends put some photos, but nothing
dramatic, quite freed from it all.
In terms of lock-in, I think that, that is where there actually is a
lock-in from my perspective.
I think, you know, when you, when you leave Facebook or when you leave, let's
say you left iOS, you can still message your friends, you know, you're, you're a
green bubble now, but you can still do it.
But so with something like a Facebook, when you leave, you're gone.
You can't interact with that world anymore.
When you leave Twitter, you're gone.
You can passively look at it, but you can't interact.
And I think that's the kind of lock-in that's interesting.
Cause the thing that's locked in is your personal relationships, which is way
stronger than any application or, or, you know, whatever you're using
on a computer or a phone.
So that kind of lock-in I think is scarier in the sense that you leave
Facebook, you can't just say, Oh, by the way, why don't you guys just all jump over here on this
other thing I'm on? No one's gonna do that. It doesn't even work with messaging apps, right?
Like you can't just say, Oh, I'm not on telegram anymore. Everybody should join whatever the new
one is this week. No one's going to do that. People are very set in their ways. And they want
to stay with, you know, stay in their lane in their lane, they just want to keep going with
what they have. So I think that's part of the thing with Facebook is everybody's already there
to leave is quite a big challenge. And especially to leave to go to something that's a paid service
is like unheard of, especially today where people don't want to pay for anything. That's the lock
in that I think is a little scarier, because then we start getting these just silos that never change
and you never have people coming in and out. And I think it's healthy for a network to have,
you know, some churn, have people coming in, leaving, coming back after they've gone and done
something else, which I've seen on micro blog a lot where, you know, somebody will leave for
whatever reason. And maybe they never come back. Maybe they do after they've looked at some other
things, but I think having those different perspectives is good. And you mentioned
Instagram, that's another big one, which, well, I guess I'll call it Facebook pictures, because
that's what it is. Photos are arguably the most important thing that anyone does online now.
and to have them all trapped in something like an Instagram.
And I used Instagram years and years ago.
And I remember trying to get all my photos out was a monumental pain.
And when I initially got them out, they were lower resolution than what I had uploaded.
So that was a problem.
That's the kind of lock-in that I worry about.
Whereas right now, I feel like I'm just defending Apple left and right here.
But it's like, call it generic company, you know, pair company.
I have it in pair photos.
I can just pull the photos out and put them somewhere else.
I can put them in Google Photos.
I can put them in Flickr, I can put them anywhere. And they're all don't don't call don't call them
pay for it. You know, there's a lot of God. Yeah, I know. Banana photos, or I'll pick it.
Maybe I'll go like a tomato photos. So we'll go with tomatoes. I don't think anybody's suing
anybody for that right now. I love those. So yeah, stick with that. Oh my gosh. Yeah. So
the lock in of your your personal relationships, I guess it's just a it's a scary thing. And I don't
When you have a company like that, that I'll be the first to say I'm, I'm very not in line with
anything Facebook has to do. I was talking with my wife the other day in terms we were just
kicking around like, what other companies would we think about working for? And there are a lot
of them came up were like, Yeah, I could probably get in line with that. And Facebook was a hard
no from both of us, because we just cannot align with anything that they are pushing right now,
or ever really. And we don't feel that there's any position within that company that we could take
to enact change, right? Because just because you don't like it doesn't mean you shouldn't go there.
If there's an opportunity for you to make change in that organization, I think that's a noble thing
to do. You should go work at this company that everyone hates if you think you can make change.
But I don't feel personally that I could go there and do anything to make a meaningful change to the way that organization is structured and the belief system that their company is based on.
It would be like going to work for a tobacco company you sort of right i'm accepting the fact that i'm killing people.
Yeah, no, that's actually the same sort of thing. That's a very, yeah, that's a good analogy, I think.
And, you know, you look at it, you say, oh, well, they do all these great things. And I don't know,
maybe I'm sure there's something they say they do is great from in terms of a tobacco company. But
at the end of the day, it's like, you're not going to go work at a tobacco company and get
them to stop making cigarettes. Yeah, you're just not right. So there's just there's, you know,
I think you never give up, but that's just something that's fundamental to their business.
so you're not going to change that. Martin, are you still on Facebook?
Oh, am I still on Facebook? No, I actually left. I maintain a, you know how you can maintain a
messenger presence, like a messenger profile? Yeah.
Yeah. So I retained that because there are some friends of mine who are on Android, who,
let's just say, are unwilling to sort of move to any sort of group messaging thing that would be
anything like iMessage. So that's the one compromise. So I no longer have a profile
there, but I maintained the chat function. So a little part of me died inside to have to continue
using it. How does that work, Martin? I'm not familiar with the... So you had like, you know,
facebook.com/martinfeld, and then you had Messenger, which I'm assuming was the same.
So now you just have like the same name, but it's only in messages?
So what I actually did, I mean, I was sort of contemplating getting rid of Facebook for years.
And then the whole Cambridge Analytica thing happened. And I went, okay, this is now beyond
to joke. And it's gotten worse since then. But you get the idea. So I actually burnt the whole
thing to the ground. I deleted the account, not just deactivated it. But then the messaging issue
persisted. And sometime before I had deleted it, Facebook added the ability to have a separate
sort of messenger profile. So I signed up again purely for the messenger option. So I don't have
a sort of profile on the normal network that you could interact with. But if you were to search me,
you would find me and be able to chat with me. Okay, so I'm assuming that's then,
If you'd still have a messenger profile that's probably their easy way for you to get back to a Facebook account if you want to okay so that makes sense they knew people are leaving but they knew people loved messages so.
Yeah it's very very clever.
Okay.
And I've got some friends at the same thing I unfortunately have to use whatsapp to keep in touch with some friends and family and I made the valiant effort of trying to get them to switch to you know.
was it Signal and Telegram and all those others? And yeah, I failed miserably.
I forget now who owns who, but that one's Facebook as well, right?
Yeah, WhatsApp is Facebook.
Yeah, that's so confusing. I don't know how people keep it straight. I mean,
they've got Facebook Messenger, then they've got this other chat, and then I think there's even a
third one, potentially. I'm assuming they all work together, probably not, but no.
Yeah, but this is where it really shows, and I don't want to take us too far down the legal path
of stuff like antitrust. But this is where you see why a company like Facebook would be targeted for
it, because there's really no reason for such a company to own all of these same same services.
It's just swallowing everyone up gradually over time. And I think, I mean, for me, the thing that
was the first instance where I recall thinking, okay, things are getting a little bit sus or weird
here. This is ages ago. Do you remember when they made the shift in language and design from the
timeline to the news feed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's sort of shifted from being, oh, this is a
thing that's chronological, and it's about my friends and socialization and family, etc, etc.
To being, oh, this is about delivering information based on interests. Of course, that was always
sort of the idea, but it just became more explicit to me at that point. Don't forget ads. Yes, ads.
Yes. Horrible. And that's when the algorithm becomes the Borg, and it consumes all.
Oh, just a head on shoulders, is that right?
Just descends from the ceiling like the board.
I want to ask a question, we touched on it a bit earlier about betas, betas.
Are you guys using Big Sur or iOS 14?
We're up to, isn't it?
Is anybody on the beta train?
Always and forever.
Really? You're brave, braver than I.
I'm recording our podcast on Big Sur.
Don't worry. Wow.
No one. And how are you finding it? I think it's great. I love both of them. Actually, I think
iOS 14 and Mac OS 11, never going to get that right. Both. I think they're great. I think
there's obviously issues. But again, they're betas. That's our betas. betas. That's something
that I think is interesting. We've had a lot of different ways to say things and a lot of different
expressions where you will say them and I'll go, I'm going to assume I know what that means.
Oh, you should have said so. What was an example?
Now I'm curious, what did we say?
I'm going to look back now, I'm going to have to listen back and then
and message you and what, what the heck did that mean? But...
You've covered it well.
But in terms of the beta betas, they've, I think they're great. I, you know, I love this stuff. So
So of course I'm going to say they're, they're awesome, but I
think the new Mac iOS is, is gorgeous.
I think some of the iconography still needs some work, but it's a beta.
So they'll, they'll get there.
Uh, they're both pretty solid too.
Amazingly.
I mean, betas in the last.
Betas previously used to really feel like alphas where you were really rolling the
dice, you'd put it on your phone and maybe it would start up again.
Maybe it wouldn't, we're not really sure.
And you would actually want to use a different device.
And now the betas, they, I have to imagine from a development standpoint,
they know that people are putting these on their devices now.
So they, they make sure that they pretty much work at this point.
Yeah.
So there really aren't a lot of issues.
I mean, there have been in the past, but now we're on public betas.
And I always tell people not to do it mostly because I don't want to support it.
But I personally think they're great.
Yeah.
I think you're very brave.
I agree with Andrew on that one.
To answer your question, Andrew, I don't do it.
that's not because I'm totally against it. I think it's very cool. I look at things and I go, "God,
I'd like to try that out." Like seeing the new iconography, various new aspects of design,
particularly for Mac OS Big Sur, very, very cool. But I think the thing, as I sort of started to
come around to doing it with public betas/betas, the thing that sort of scared me off was hearing
certain tech podcasters and writers talking about how it stuffed up some of their iCloud
connected stuff. For me, I mean, I store a lot of my writing and things on iCloud. And even if it's
probably very safe, that's the one thing that makes me go, "Ugh, if there's one bug and it wipes
all this stuff that's synchronized to the cloud, that's... maybe it's unjustified, but I feel a
little bit worried by that." >> Don't say that.
>> I'm sorry. >> Now that's what I'm gonna think about.
>> As I'm looking at my iCloud folder to make sure files aren't disappearing.
>> Oh, God. Okay. >> There is one negative, though,
Actually, I just thought about is it, it's kind of like Christmas early where now when it actually comes out and it's exciting, it's like, I've been using that for three months.
That was exactly the analogy I was about to say.
You're stealing my notes.
I was about to say exactly that thing.
You got to wait for Christmas.
You can't open your presents early.
Well, you're in agreement.
That's beautiful.
Yeah.
I think maybe it's me getting old as well.
I'm a bit like, a bit more risk averse.
I don't want things to go wrong.
And I think, ah, I'll just wait till they say it's ready to wait till it's fully
baked.
And then I'll, and then I say to myself, but I won't install it on day one.
I'll wait and let people, you know, find the bugs and I'll install the point one.
And I say that to myself every single year and it gets to about 12 hours in.
And I think, ah, I'm just going to do it.
And then I install away.
I have a similar progression of developer beta one is announced and I go, okay, cool.
I'm going to, I'm going to wait until day two, just in case.
And generally it's about eight minutes and I've already got installed.
Doesn't take long.
I wait patiently for my Christmas presents, but then when they arrive, when it's Christmas
day, I'm there at 7am ripping open the paper, give me my presents.
Can I shift tracks real quick to the Hey email thing?
I'm just dying to know what you guys are thinking about this.
I'll go for it.
It's been bothering me since it came out.
And I just, the whole, we don't have to talk about the whole app store thing.
I don't care about that.
Um, but just in general, the email Slack, which is another
thing, nobody talks about email, but the way that this whole thing has
progressed where, you know, we had Slack, which solved all of our email
problems, except didn't, and then we have hay, which is supposed to solve
all of our email problems.
Not sure how that's going to happen.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andrew, didn't he, did you, was it you that wrote
something about create like recreating hay in like fast mail or something?
Yeah.
That, that blog post has been my most successful post of I'm sure all time.
I've, I've been blogging for many years under different guises and some have
occasionally gotten a bit of traction, but that article went bonkers.
The only problem with it being hosted on micro blog is that I don't actually have
stats to tell you exactly how bonkers it went.
4 billion people read it and interacted with it.
That's what I heard.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It even got mentioned by Brett Terpstra and when he linked to it, I thought, oh,
wow, this is like, this is my Gruber moment, Martin, when you were linked, when
you were mentioned by John Gruber.
So yeah, I, so I tried Hay, tried Hay out, gave it a red hot go, forwarded all my
email into it for the trial period and it just didn't didn't do it for me. So
I've recently gone back, I've been a fast mail customer for some time but I've
recently been using SaneBox again. I used it once before a couple of years
ago and used it for the year and gave up on it but I thought now I'm gonna try
it again and probably I'm getting more email now as well but it's really paying
off, I've been happy with SaneBox.
And it actually just seems to do what Hay purports to do in a better way.
And I think where it suffers is just the marketing oomph.
SaneBox isn't really as well known, doesn't have that great marketing edge that the base
camp guys do.
More technical too, right?
Where you actually have to go and set things up versus just sign up for an account.
Yeah, it's not too difficult.
you kind of just have to give it your logins
and it kind of auto configures itself.
But it does look, it certainly looks more daunting,
even if perhaps it isn't that difficult.
And because it lives within your own
existing email framework,
I find it to be a better option.
Yeah, so I wrote a post that talked about
how I use a combination of Fastmail, Sanebox,
and my email app of choice, Mailmate,
to recreate the sort of the workflow of Hey.
It was just a thought experiment of my own
that I came up with and decided to share it.
But I don't know, Hey, it looks nice, it looks snazzy,
but it was just a lot of handholding.
I felt like I was having to yes, no things.
And then it would be like, well, I kind of want this one,
but I don't always want emails from them.
So do I yes them or do I know them?
It was too binary, I would say.
- Different things work for different people.
This one, I just didn't get it.
It felt like it was making it more complex than what I was already doing.
On top of the fact that now they like, I'm never going to use whatever at hay.com.
Um, why would I use that?
Yeah, that just doesn't make sense.
You know, back to again, back to lock in.
Why, why would I ever want to be trapped at something?
Hey.com.
You know, I would never want to be trapped@gmail.com either, but the, the
Hey, thing is it's brand new and you're going to do, you're going to stake your
whole existence of is, I mean, email arguably is very important nowadays.
It used to just be kind of a.
A fun little, let's write some, some letters, but you know, your identity is
tied to your email in most cases.
So having it be at something that is brand new and you have no idea how long
it's going to last seems a little bit.
Terrifying, but again, could be me, but overall I just, I didn't understand the.
The hype, I think email in general is kind of overhyped on the internet
amongst, you know, the crowds that we probably circle within, you know,
anytime there's a new email app or email anything, it's like the news of the
week where we got to dive in and dissect everything that it does.
And at the end of the day, it's still email.
So whatever, but yeah, the hay thing, I don't know.
I was just curious.
Cause I, I tried it as well.
I signed up at first.
I was like, I don't need that.
I was like, oh, what the heck?
I should know about things before saying that, you know, it's not for me.
I didn't try it, although I've obviously been following the news and the feature set and
everything. But I think the point that you made there about email being one of the things that
tech enthusiasts or just fans in general go for, it's just something that people like us want to
twiddle with or to experiment with. For the vast majority of people, email is just the thing that
they sign up for. It just receives all of their work correspondence or their marketing or e-newsletter
material and that's it. So I think naturally email could certainly improve, but I think the vast
majority of people, even if they hate it, don't really actively think about how it needs to be
improved or overhauled. So I could sort of see maybe current email providers or big companies
maybe taking some design inspiration from, "Hey, if certain stuff works," but I don't necessarily
see it overhauling everything, sort of like what you alluded to with, "Yay, Slack's supposed to
redesign everything, but it didn't really. Yeah, it's funny that in this, you know, the one thing
people complain about the most is their email and yet, and how much they hate it and it's just
disdain for email yet it seems to be one of the most popular topics amongst tech people. So I
don't know how that really works, but I think it's a, it's a common denominator. We can all relate
to it. So you have an automatic audience for reading the stuff because yeah, everybody has
has to deal with email. So it has a wide range of interest. I think maybe that's it.
Yeah, we all depend on it. Some people have certain rules and are obsessively filing into
folders and marking things as junk and archive. And then some people just let the inbox number
grow and grow and grow and then take a screenshot and tweet the badge on their icon. So it takes
all sorts.
Okay, now I have to know you have to reveal how many emails are in your inbox right now
how many are currently read slash unread and
What email applications you use because everyone needs to know
Andrew do you want to go first? All right, you go first. Okay, right, so
I have two personal email accounts and a university account all of which are in the mail app
just the stock standard one for iOS,
and that has 64 unread collectively.
And for work, I use Outlook.
- Well, I can tell you in my inbox at the moment,
I have two emails, both of them are read,
and I have a couple in my same box things,
just a couple, 'cause I filtered it just earlier tonight.
So yeah, two unreads there.
In my work, and that's with Mailmate, so yeah, just two.
work I do use Outlook for my sins and I have,
oh look, I've got another one unread mail
and I've got three unreads in my,
three reds, one unread in my inbox.
So I like to keep it neat.
- Neither of you are monsters, I'm happy to hear this.
- Thank you so much.
Why, you're using just mail as well or what's happening?
- No, I'm a weirdo.
I use an app that has been deleted from the face of the earth several times and is now
back again.
Newton.
Oh, right.
Okay.
It's, uh, yeah, I know.
Right.
That's what most people say.
They're like, oh, it's still a thing.
I think so.
Um, it got, it's been shut down, I think three times now and now it's got new owners again,
but I love it.
But uh, yeah, so Newton, I'll, I'll cross the board on everything and I have four unread
from this morning.
And yeah, when you say this morning, it is literally just you're,
you're still in your morning. Yeah. That's, that's fair play.
It's a new day for me. I've just started warning myself. So hello,
Jason from somewhere in the future.
God, we got to fix this time zone thing. Like somehow,
how have we not fixed this yet?
I know what time do you have to get up for in the morning?
Oh, I'm a free spirit. You know, I'll just, no, I'll decide. It's like,
I'm working from home, but no, normally start a date, but that's cool.
You'll just have a couple Australian coffees and you'll be good.
Oh, it's going to be great.
And look, I mean, Australia has the highest rate of consumption
of instant coffee in the world, which is a bit disturbing.
I won't be drinking it.
But if you watch all of our ads, it's apparently what Australians do.
They drink out of red Nescafe cups.
Do you see that? Really?
West Coast, Andrew?
Yeah, but it's disgusting.
You don't actually do that. Yeah.
Like we have great coffee.
Like the little you put like you put the crystals in the thing
And you just kind of stir it up and that's that's coffee.
They like to that's what they advertise to us.
That's what they advertise. That's right.
Apparently it's really high because everyone just buys it and sticks it in the cupboard
just in case you run out of something like I'll have like a flat white, you know,
espresso every day. I'm sure you're the same, Andrew.
Like what do you have?
Yeah, it's yeah.
If I go to my local coffee shop generally most days and get a flat white,
which Jason, how do we explain a flat white?
Oh, no. So when Martin was here, he
He chastised our coffee the whole time he was here.
Oh god.
I don't recall that.
It was sad.
It was terrible.
It is terrible.
He just had nothing good to say about our coffee.
There is nothing good to say about your coffee.
I don't recall such negativity.
It's atrocious.
Sure, I'll take the job.
I feel like I'm being personally attacked here, but that's okay.
Look, if Americans think Starbucks is good coffee.
No, no, no, no.
Hold on.
Don't.
No.
I'm not I will not I got so yeah flat white from a coffee shop in the morning is the ultimate
it so it's a shot of coffee from a from an espresso style shot topped up with
Not foam milk, but it's a
The milk is heated. So it becomes velvety would be the way I would describe it. That's a great description. It's very smooth
Yeah, yep. So it's it's you don't add water to it at all. It's just
well, the water that's in the short shot of coffee and then milk.
And that is a staple of the Australian coffee diet.
This is randomly off, well, sort of on topic, but I have noticed as I've traveled around
to different places in the world, how much different drink culture is in different places
where like in America, you almost everyone is walking around with something.
either a bottle of water, a gigantic coffee that's way too big or some soda or something.
The big gulp. Yeah, because Americans always have a big gulp.
Exactly. That is what we do. We all have big gulps with our name on them, and we just walk
around with it. But then I went, you go to somewhere like Japan, and if you're walking
around with a drink in the middle of Tokyo, people are kind of looking at you like, "What
the hell are you doing?" to consume that and get rid of it.
Yeah, sit down and drink it and move on.
Yeah, yeah. It sounds like- is that kind of similar where you guys are, or is it kind of all over the
board? What you've described about really trudging around carrying a drink, I saw that a lot when I
used to work in Sydney. And it's actually something when I saw when Jerry Seinfeld came over,
Natasha and I saw him live, and it was great. And he made a big deal about how Australians in Sydney
were just charging through the streets, you know, take no prisoners, holding their flat whites really
firmly in their hand. But I feel you don't get that sort of marching aggression in more
regional areas like where I live. You know, people will actually go out to a cafe, sit
down, calmly drink, and then move on with their lives.
That makes sense. You're just more civilised. I get it.
Yeah, in the regional areas. What about you, Andrew? You're a sitter?
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I try to avoid the CBD these days. But yeah, people will generally
walk around with a coffee or a bottle of water. We're a hot city as well in the summertime,
So often you'll see people carrying some water around.
Yeah, but I don't think it's,
you generally don't see people walking around
with soft drinks or sodas.
- No, no.
- You would call them, nah, it's not a done thing.
Really, that's for kids to drink,
not really for the grownups.
- Yeah, I would agree with that.
I would agree with that.
Although, just to take the heat off the US for a bit,
I recall when I was in Germany, traveling with family,
I saw that they actually had introduced the flat white
Starbucks and we were really fascinated and we thought, "Oh, we've got to go and try the
Starbucks take on a flat white in Germany. Let's go see." So we went up and ordered and we said,
I couldn't help myself but make a comment at the counter and I said, "Oh, it's really interesting
that you've brought in the flat white at Starbucks." And I didn't say any more than that.
And the person behind the counter, the German person said, "Yes, yes, it's very interesting.
We've introduced the flat white." And you'll notice actually that the reason that it's called
a flat white. If you look at the picture, it's because the shape of the cup is actually flatter,
it's more stout. And I just sat, I just sort of stood there in disbelief thinking it has nothing
to do with the shape of the cup. And I sort of was tormented in my brain as to whether I should
be smug and say, well, I'm Australian and you're wrong, but I let it go.
That was a test for humanity for you and you passed.
Thank you. Thank you. I managed to hold it together and push beyond and just accept that
a German flat white is actually literally physically flatter than an Australian version.
Very precise.
Oh, very precise. Very flat. Very circular. Very precise. So look, I mean, I think,
is there anything else that you two wanted to cover out of our topics? I think coffee is a
nice way to maybe end it. An addiction for all of us.
It's actually perfect because I just ran out and I need to get more. So
I think that's a great place to wrap.
Yeah, I think so.
Perfect. So, I mean, given that we always are ruminating on this podcast, is there anything
that you'd like to maybe take back from what we have been discussing and leave a certain thought
with the audience, something for them to consider? I would like to, I will ruminate on the fact that
look at your social networks, decide whether you're getting value out of them and think about
whether a conversation with somebody might be a better option than just liking it or
thumbs up.
Because I have enjoyed this conversation with two of my internet friends absolutely wholeheartedly.
It's been great.
I've really enjoyed it too.
And what about you, Jason?
I think for me, I would love for when you're looking at things online, when you're looking
at things around, well, maybe not so much around the world right now, but in terms of
criticizing what, you know, we kind of jokingly, I think for the most part,
you know, said a lot of things about windows and what other people are using.
But at the end of the day, I think.
Try to think long and hard before you criticize what someone else is doing,
especially if it has no impact on you whatsoever, because at the end of the
day, we're all trying to just get through everything that's happening.
So I, you know, I think lighthearted joking about, Oh, use Android.
Nice.
I whatever, it's fine.
They're all tools to get something accomplished.
So I just, I see so much in the news about, you know, this company did that,
this company did that, that they did this.
Try to try to think outside of your own perspective on why the way things are the
way they are, because I think a lot of times you'll find that you don't have all
the information for the opinion that you're forming.
And I'm not saying I'm any kind of Saint in this regard, either.
I say dumb things all the time that aren't true or, or just, I don't have all the
information. So I need to do a better job of that as well. But think about things before you criticize,
because it may mean a lot more to the other person than it does to you.
That's a great point. Both great points from both of you. And look, I've really enjoyed this. And I
suppose that we have micro.blog and the team there for sort of bringing us together. This
has been a wonderful sort of audio experiment. I really enjoyed it, having you both to chat to.
Where can people find you online to follow or chat if they're interested, both of you?
I am on micro.blog as @canyon. So you can just go to micro.blog/canyon is probably the easiest way
for people to do that. Or you can find my website andrewcanyon.com.
I have for me just part of the website's the best, it goes everywhere. Berk.io, B-U-R-K, no E.
Fantastic. Well, thank you both. It's been really great. And as usual, at the end of Lounge Ruminator,
I encourage you, dear listener, if you have any feedback, want to get in touch,
make sure to visit the site loungeruminator.net. You can follow me at Twitter,
or micro.blog@martinfeld. I've really enjoyed the episode today. Hope you have too.
And we'll catch you next time.
