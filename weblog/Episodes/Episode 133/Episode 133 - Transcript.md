Oh,

yeah.

This is from last time.

It was--

Is this follow-up?

--the media corner.

Follow-up.

Well, I don't know, because we never talked about it.

So I guess it's follow-forward, maybe?

If you have topics for a show

that

get bumped

to the next show, what is that?

Is that follow forward?

- Carry over.

- Carry over, there it is.

Carry the one.

So this is Carry the One Corner.

I was gonna talk just briefly about

your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

New TV show, new

animated

series.

Kind of reminiscent of X-Men 97, if you've heard of that.

Where it's like, we had the show back in the 90s

And then they redid like a, not redid it,

but they did like a new extension of it,

but in that style.

Everything back then kind of had its own style for sure.

Like, oh, that's a 90s cartoon for sure.

So X-Men 97, which was not the thing

I was gonna talk about, but is also great.

Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,

kind of in the same vein.

It felt like a

redo

or re-envisioning of a past thing.

So it's this weird new, but old at the same time.

Thank you for, um, uh, quote unquote,

correcting the spelling by putting a U in neighborhood. Perfect. Um,

trust me, crazy. Check out without the U.

If you're in, I think it's a, it's, that's like a proper title though. So I'm,

I don't know, would that be, would it be different? I'm curious now.

As in, can you change the U if the American title only has an O?

I'm wondering like, huh, I'll have to look at that. We'll look at that.

That'll be follow up for next time. But yeah,

Friendly Neighborhood Spider and really good series.

It's only like 10 episodes, but I think it's, I think they're doing good, good work over there.

What service is it on?

I think it's on,

it's

on one of those.

Yeah. One of those ones that's out there.

It's probably red or green,

maybe blue.

As an obnoxious starting the theme turn whenever an episode starts.

I just find that strange.

Do you find that strange that everyone has to have a ridiculous, you know, boom.

Yeah, but what is that? It's like

a, it's a thing, right? It's like an audio, audio's, is that the stinger? Is that the audio stinger or like audio?

It's like a

branded stinger.

It's like a trademark

thing, this audio.

Yeah.

I do feel like the Disney+ one's the most ridiculous one. It's got three or four parts in it because they've got the wooshy star thing. And then the boom and it's like, well, is this a stinger? It's just a mega stinger. It's many stingers. I don't know what it is.

I like the Apple ID one

the

Apple the Apple one I always try and Apple ID Apple TV one I like that I was trying.

Yeah it's like the Mac chime it's like the Mac startup chime so it feels nice to Apple nerds.

Does anybody else sort of trying to sing along with them because when the Apple one comes on I always sort of go.

You know and try and mimic it.

And I never quite get it right.

I don't know if I do or not, but I'll have to pay attention for that.

Media Corner.

I wanted to bring this up briefly because we've got a bit of a, let's say, music thing happening on the show at

the moment. I've tried the Mod Pod thing before. Jason's gone heavily into the Mod Pod thing.

He's modifying iPod Hi-Fis with little Airplay nubbin watsies.

And you know what? Sorry, my God, there's actually two iPod Hi-Fis in there.

Bloody hell.

Stereo pair.

All right, well, I'll get my, you know, useless update out of the way so we can get to the real meat of the

conversation. I just wanted to say that all of this music, chat and

impending resubscription dates coming up.

Andrew is derailing me again with a HomePod Mini.

Do you want to talk about your HomePod Mini, Andrew?

It's on the desk. Look at that quality.

Look how small

it looks in his hand.

It's like a HomePod micro.

It's a baseball.

Beautiful.

Sorry, Martin, you were saying.

That's OK. This is actually

kind of a public service announcement.

I want to encourage people to start unsubscribing from certain,

I'll say shit, all right.

But not this shit.

Not our shit.

This year.

Wait, to be clear, you don't you don't mean this show.

I'm not going to tell people not to think it's shit.

I hope they don't think it's shit.

But anyway, the actual shit that I'm talking about is this year, it's pretty much, I think, 10 years since Apple Music was launched.

Right. I jumped on the bandwagon pretty much straight away because I liked that.

Yeah, 2015.

I'm pretty sure, Jason.

- Really? - Remember the weekend

was there to perform and the developers loved it.

- Wait, you mean like Apple Music,

like the thing we have right now,

not like iTunes or something like

Apple

Music.

- Wow. - I'm saying from memory,

unless I'm mistaken, people can mastodon

or micro.bloggers or whatever they want.

Pretty sure 2015 was the launch of Apple Music

after they purchased Beats and everything.

And

the

sales pitch of that service was,

oh, you've got streaming stuff over here

library over here, why not combine them?

You've got your purchased and ripped music,

let the library live in the same area

as your additions from the streaming service.

And if people recall, I think Jim Delrimple

back in the day was the one who had the biggest disaster

of all of his highly kind of exclusive

or obscure music wiped through the iTunes matching service

that had been bolted onto Apple Music.

I didn't have that experience straight away,

but over the years, as that original sales pitch

and the music that was your purchase to write music is essentially replaced by the matched stuff.

I've had nothing but problems. It's been an absolute disaster in terms of,

"Oh, here's your favourite album from 20 years ago."

Well, sorry, because now half of the tracks are still there,

but the other half are mismatched and placed individually in different compilations

that have something like

"Top

20 Romance Tracks" or something from movies,

or "Top 30 Beer Drinking Songs".

It's just been a total mess.

So I decided that's it.

I'm pulling the plug on Apple Music and I'm going back to rebuilding my library

from the backup that I had.

I hadn't lost a lot of stuff, but it's a lot of, you know, finding things, ripping this again,

even visiting the library when we happen to go as a family and finding stuff that was lost that I actually did buy

in certain examples.

Like I had music by Franz Ferdinand that I bought and now is no longer in my purchase history.

So it's trying to go back with the mess of iTunes mixing with Apple Music.

And I wanted to say, look, everyone out there has probably been on Apple Music for years.

I think Spotify probably has similar problems if it's down to labels, you know, adding

and managing and curating libraries, because it's not you running your metadata anymore.

It's labels on those platforms.

It's not all Apple and Spotify's fault, I would say, although they provide the platform for this to happen.

Save your money. Stop paying for music that you don't own.

if you can be bothered to run this,

I know it's not for everybody,

but since diving into this process,

you know, digging into this rabbit hole as Jason has done,

I find I'm listening to more music that I actually like.

It's not lost in this, you know,

crap heap cesspool of stuff that keeps getting replaced

and flicked from your music library.

So stop paying, whether it's Apple Music or Spotify,

be in charge of your own music.

And that's my public service announcement.

Rant over.

- I just last night, I had some friends over.

I had some friends over and I pulled out Apple Music to put some background tunes on.

And I found this really cool kind of like mix.

It was like some sort of DJ mix.

I don't know. It was good.

And it was in one of the playlists.

And I

like, I was liking it.

And now I can't find it.

Like literally 12 hours ago.

Yeah.

I don't know where I found it in Apple Music.

I remember last night I pushed the plus button to add to my library.

And I think what it did, I wanted it to add that playlist,

but I think what it's done is added the album

that I was, that might've been playing at the time

or something, I don't really know

'cause I haven't had a chance to check it out,

but I am very confused.

So sort of agreeing with you and sort of disagreeing

with you in that as an Apple Music subscriber,

I found something cool yesterday,

but now today I can't find it again.

So kind of good, that was good discovery opportunity then,

but then what's the point if you can't go back to it

less than a day later?

- And it's hard because Apple Music,

I still see the benefit of that

and things like Spotify for discovery

and convenience of everything.

And I feel doubly bad because I've recommended

to family members, you know, almost 10 years ago now,

jump on the bandwagon and do this thing

because my experience at the beginning was positive.

Over time, I feel it's degraded and things are a mess.

So I would say, if you don't find yourself

wanting to discover new music all the time

and you like what you like

and maybe add things occasionally,

why are you paying endlessly for music

that you're not actually listening to or owning?

So it's down to your personal example

of discovery and usage.

- This is music to my ears.

I'm so happy to hear that this is the new path,

the new path for Martin.

I love it.

I'm very

excited.

- Yeah, it's a lot more fun when it's your own stuff.

- You've got, so what are you doing, Jason?

'Cause you've been doing something similar.

- I have been,

yeah.

Everything you said about Apple Music is absolutely right.

Yeah, I won't repeat what you just said,

but plus 100 to what you were saying.

I started rebuilding and have been rebuilding

and continue to rebuild.

I just actually got a CD the other day

to replace an album that was missing two tracks

because it took my ripped version

And then what it gave me back was whatever theirs was,

plus two that were DRM'd.

So I couldn't listen to those two tracks of the album

that I uploaded to them.

So cool.

Anyway, everything I have is DRM free now,

and it is all high quality FLAC files.

And it's incredible.

It sounds great.

And I'm now using--

I knew it was just

a matter of time.

FLAC man.

Yeah, that's now my take a drink word or whatever,

like eat a cracker, whatever your thing is, that's me now.

I'm gonna say a word that is gonna ruin so many lives

and I apologize in advance.

- Sabbatical.

- Oh, push through, push through, keep going,

keep the segment alive.

Rune.

I'm sorry, I'm so incredibly sorry.

Rune is a music management.

So you know when people talk about bullet journaling

and

like GTD, I'm kind of thinking Rune is kind of in,

or knowledge graphs, right?

Like all those things that people get obsessed about.

Rune kind of feels like that,

except it is also really good

in the way that it manages all of your stuff.

So

the

quick version is

you

can either get their

like little server box thing that runs all your music

and pushes it wherever,

or you can just run it on your own computer,

which I think is super cool.

If you don't wanna deal with that, buy their box thing.

If you're cool with having your own computer running,

like do that too.

They even provide the full like Rune OS

that you can build your own like little Intel NUC box

and basically build their exact hardware yourself.

So that's pretty cool.

But anyway, the service, it manages all your music.

It allows you to push stuff to different places.

It does everything like bit for bit.

So everything that's going through the whole pipeline

is exactly what it is on the disc.

And the thing that I'm really loving about it

is that the management part is really good,

but also there, which is, I think it's called Rune Radio,

where basically, let's say I play an album

and then that album is over,

it will then just continue playing other stuff

from my library.

And this is the first time I've ever had something

smart play my music that actually was like,

yeah, these all really fit well together.

Like there's clearly something intelligent there

that is picking the right next thing

that's not just like all my tracks and shuffle.

So you get like

a

slow, nice song

and like some crazy like, you know, punk song.

And then it goes to like, it's just all over the place.

It really makes a nice concerted effort

to like

keep

playing music that makes sense together.

So it's great.

It's not super inexpensive.

It's not terribly expensive either,

but I've been using it.

I think I have a two week trial

and I started out with like, okay, let's try it.

I think I have six days left

that I'm like

110

% ready to purchase.

I think it's just a really, really good system.

And they have things that are called like

Rune,

like tested or whatever.

So like all AirPlay 2 devices,

it'll just play to them like normal.

So that's totally fine.

HomePods, Apple TV, whatever's AirPlay 2, it'll just work.

If you have an AirPlay 2, iPod Hi-Fi, it'll play to that.

But they also have Rune Ready,

which are like hardware devices

that are kind of interfaced with Rune.

So I got a new digital audio player.

It's Rune ready, so it can just stream all my Rune stuff.

And the gotcha that I think most people probably think

is like, well, that's cool, it's in my house.

What about when I'm gone?

They have a phone app, RuneArc,

that allows you to stream or download everything

to your phone.

So you have everything there.

You can download the full, like, you know,

uncompressed

FLAC files if you want,

or you can have it be compressed, whatever.

Anyway, it's really great.

If you are actually wanting to listen to music,

and if you're like, I wanna listen to music albums,

I wanna like experience music,

I think it's absolutely incredible for that.

I've never used anything as music centric as this,

where the point of it is music and nothing else.

So yeah, that's it.

I'll stop there.

It's great, I love it.

And

again,

I can't see anything at this point

as to a reason why I would not make a purchase.

- You've obviously gone much more intensely into this

than I have in terms of rebuilding the library,

but that suits you.

And it just shows whether you go for just like

rebirthing iTunes as it was, as I have,

and I'm just doing like 320 gigabit per second MP3s

or doing your RuneReady journey, Jason.

It's like, you're in control, you're running it.

You decide where things go and how it looks,

not a label decided to change

the

compilation

or canon of a certain artist.

now it's gone. You're in control. So listeners, be in control.

I have two questions.

Oh, um,

why is Rune so expensive when it's basically just a media player?

It seems like it's a subscription. Like why? Um, that's my first question.

Do you want the second question?

Yes. I would like both please.

Does it, can you,

can you then airplay to HomePods and things like that?

Or does it require Sonos or some other amplifier system?

- Nope, everything is, if it's AirPlay 2,

it just is a source, or sorry,

a destination that you can push to.

And from any device, you can control any other device,

which is nice too.

So you could like pick up your phone

and tell your computer to play to a device

and then also have it play on your phone

at something completely different.

So every end point gets its own stuff.

And you can also do like the,

the thing where you could like send it the same thing to multiple places.

I don't know if there's a name for that, but like you can do that with like home

pods, right? Like play this in all the home pods in my house. It's the same thing.

It's just, yeah. Airplay too. It just uses the same airplay too as everything else.

As far as the, why does it cost money? I don't know. I guess,

cause it's really good.

they're making a thing and they want to get paid for it, I guess.

I mean, that makes sense. I understand that.

Yeah. They do have a lifetime option if you're like, if that's your thing.

But the whole lifetime thing,

I've never seen it make sense for me because it'll,

it seems like it's always like, you know,

it's X dollars per month and then there's usually if you pay for a year,

you get

like

a month free or whatever, right? Like that's usually the model.

And then there'll be this lifetime one

that's like

a

lot more, right?

Like it'll be

12,

you know, $15 a month,

$100 a year, or like $800 lifetime.

And I never understand those

because like when you figure it out,

it doesn't seem like it quote, pays for itself

until usually like five years, six years later.

And I'm just trying to like, I always think back,

are there any software things or,

- No, I guess software is what we're talking about.

Are there any software things that I'm still using

from six years ago?

Seems highly unlikely

that

you're gonna use something

for that long and then continue like well beyond that

to make it like really worth it.

I don't know.

Yeah, but they do have that if that's your thing.

- Is it about the psychology of the language?

Like when you think about it,

it's really maybe the lifetime of the product.

But when people read it, they go,

oh, lifetime subscription, kind of like for life.

Oh, what a great deal. That'll be forever. It's almost

like

until you're dead.

Oh, I'm so excited to hear about this.

Yeah. I spent money.

I know it's crazy, right?

OK, so recently I've I've always been one to fall asleep listening to something.

OK, like ever since I was a kid, it was listening to audio books, listening to the radio, talkback radio.

And it always had to be like, and then it was BBC News.

I've always had somebody chatting to me as I fall asleep.

And I'm willing to continue that on,

but that can be annoying for other people.

And I try to be considerate.

So I've recently been sleeping with my AirPods,

which it's not a great experience.

It sort of gets a little painful.

And you try and lie, I'm a side sleeper.

So I put my head on my pillow

and it's just like jamming into my ear.

And I thought this guy who

swallowed it and pooped it out.

That's how that happened.

I think so careful.

Oh, I don't, I don't want to be that either.

So, and I remembered, I was thinking, I was like, I remember when I was a kid for a while, I had a, I had a, um, a little speaker, a pillow speaker.

Yes.

Yes.

It was on a wire.

It was on a wire and I'd stick it under the pillow.

It was a little flat disc.

I do that with my phone now.

And it was the worst.

Oh, it was so bad.

I

was like, I wonder if they still sell those, you know, not remembering that it's now 30

years on in technology.

But a USB-C

version, obviously.

Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.

Well it turns out technology is even better.

Who would have guessed?

And I found two options in these like what they call sleep buds, sleep pods, whatever

they want to call them.

little, they're like air pods but tinier and they usually have more squishy bits.

So they kind of sit right in your ear and don't protrude at all.

And there was the, what was the one?

There was, I forgot.

It was like a Bose one, right?

I did all the research on it, now I've forgotten the one that I didn't get.

But it was super expensive.

Yeah, it was the ex-Bose guys.

They left Bose and they created their own company.

Ah, geez, why is totally blanking on it now?

But that was, to buy them in Australia, they were $500 Australian dollars.

I was like, that's, I was almost about to do it.

I was like, that's so much money.

But look, why not?

And then I just did another little search and I found these Soundcore Sleepbuds A20

model.

And they were only $250.

That's a lot more palatable, even if they're not quite as good.

I'm you know like it's half price so I ordered them and verdict I love them.

They are so good they're so good they're a little bit fiddly like in the way that they

get into the case because they're kind of like an airpod thing situation they have a

little docking case and they sit in the case when you're not using them and all that and

they're a little bit fiddly they don't quite sit quite as neatly with their little magnetic

charges. But that's all right, you don't buy them for the case. And the app itself is a

bit obscure, it's a bit weird. But really all I wanted was just a Bluetooth speaker,

because the app is all about, you know, sort of playing these sounds and meditative noises

and all that. I don't want any of that. I just want to listen to some people talking

at me. So it's just a Bluetooth speaker for the majority

and it's

sensational. Like I

stick them in there, once they're in I hardly feel them, I can side sleep. If you get them,

they sounded a bit tinny to begin with and then I realised I just hadn't wedged them

quite right in my ear. And then after a couple of nights I changed the size of the tip, you

know, the little silicon tips, they give you all the different sizes, so I changed them

out. I've got it dialed in just to how I like it now. Jams in my ear, good stereo, good

seal, like you don't hear other people around you as much as well. So it's not active noise

cancelling but because it's jammed in it blocks out a lot and it's fantastic. And then it

does do some sleep tracking as well. So it counts how many times you roll over in the

night, so attempts to assess how well you slept. And it has little features like once

it thinks you're asleep it will turn the music off or the sound off and it can then switch

to playing those ambient noises if you want or just go to sleep. Really good! So the Soundcore

Sleepbuds. Turns out Soundcore, I didn't know anything about the company but it's actually

like an Anker brand which is I think the Amazon brand so it all goes back to big tech right? You

can't escape it. But um oh and I just remembered the $500 ones they were Oslo. Oslo that was the

the name of them is the the old bows guy ones.

So now with these buds permanently wedged in your ear, are you kind of like Lobot from Cloud City?

I didn't get that reference.

You know Lando Calrissian's cybernetic guy with the thing around his head in Empire Strikes Back?

Oh, vaguely.

That's you.

I vaguely remember that guy.

That's you,

but from 2025 and not imagined from 1980.

Wow.

Well, I guess that's good.

I like it. I like it.

I'll add

that to your list of nicknames.

Andrew Lobot Canyon.

- Okay, now the problem is I don't have a code

to put on canyon.blog/save.

- Oh, what is even the point?

Why are we even here?

- Then why are you talking about it?

Why is it even a topic?

- I know, so we may have to edit this out

and wait till I get code

and then I'll splice it into episode 195 or something.

But yeah, really good.

So do you guys need that kind of sleep support

or you just like hit the pillow and you're out?

I would like silence actually.

Yeah.

I used to be able to fall asleep, but now I am

too

much in my own head about

everything constantly forever.

So I have to, I generally would love something to be

something

in there that could tell me to shut the hell up would be awesome.

Um, and yeah, I've tried air air pods, horrible, absolutely.

The most uncomfortable thing you could possibly try to sleep with, um, over the air, over, over the ear ones would be great.

But side sleep doesn't work.

Can't do it.

Unless you dig a hole in

your pillow the way that people do when they hide stuff in books.

Like you'd actually have to have a dimmer.

Yeah, you need like a

little cut out.

Exactly. I've looked at these as well, actually.

So that's why I was very excited to hear your take, because I didn't know which ones to get.

And I was just afraid it was going to be yet another ear bud that just was uncomfortable.

I'm guessing they're kind of small.

Yeah, they're tiny.

They're like, if you imagine an air pod and like saw off the little stem

and

then shrink it down even more.

And it's quite flat.

The little silicon rubbery bits are bigger than the kind of the actual bud.

It's

tiny.

Okay.

That makes sense.

I assumed because like, you don't need it to do much.

It's like at the most, I don't want it.

I hope I don't hear it for more than like 30 minutes.

Great like so the battery should be I would assume probably pretty small because

you

don't need it to last very long

Are you falling asleep to like miss Casey's wellness?

Soundtracks or something is this what that would be a good one to get actually

I think there is a

Actually, you guys won't be able to

access it because you've ditched a subscription music

But I think there is and I saw somewhere recently met probably on YouTube anyway

Like an 8-hour wellness a wellness video or something with all the severance music looped

That would be a good one to fall asleep to but no it's really good the one thing I will say bad about them is

The color that why did they make them slightly?

tan fawn

Brownish color that the case and the little buds

I don't know if they're meant to try and they're trying to think it will camouflage into your skin tones or something

But it's a really off-putting color

When I'm sleeping Lord, I don't want anybody to know I'm wearing headphones cuz I would just be

that

would be too much

How many times how many nights have you used them and how many times have they fallen out?

Okay, so I've had them for

Had them for a bit over around about a week or two a week a week of just over a week

I've used them almost every night. I think last night I didn't but most other nights I've put them in so five to six nights

They have fallen out zero times. I've a couple of nights I slept right through

woke up in the morning and they were still in there. A few other nights

I woke up you know the 4 a.m. wake up which I tend to do and then I just pull

them out. I pull them out at that point. I

hate the 4 a.m. wake up.

Why is

it

always 4 a

.m.?

4 a.m. is the worst time to exist. It's too early to do anything.

It's too late to do any it's just bad. Yeah,

it's good. It's the curse time for him

But it is a good time to take out your arm

your sound buds

Sleep

buds, what are they called?

Your anchor sound core a 20 earbuds brought to you by

Andrew Canyon comm

that's

if you can even see them to remove them given that they camouflage perfectly into your ear canal

You

can eat yeah you're

like wait where are they I know they're there.

As I said Lobot you just merging cybernetically or you know.

I would like to I'll be curious to know if I could wear them out and actually as air pods I don't think that work very well I think they're a bit too low powered but because they haven't got huge sound.

Because they're for sleeping but be an interesting experiment I guess you could do it.

Well if you have a missing lemon you happen to be in Willingham or I'm around then I'll just talk to you.

Endlessly to put you to sleep if that's what you need to go to sleep I'll just like to you to sleep.

Oh we could do a one prime plus bonus where it's just Martin talking for like 6 hours.

I don't know if I have that time but I could easily jabber on for a little while and then you can just keep repeating it was been a loop.

Can you just put that on and

go

right to sleep.

He's got that German dictionary behind his head there he can actually just read that.

Well,

it's got lots of examples of like business and cultural correspondence in there.

So I could crack it out, go down the middle.

You know how it's got like German to English and then English to German.

That middle bit that's like a different color on the edge of the paper, that's all of the

correspondence stuff.

So I could just read endless, endless rubbish to you if you want.

You go to sleep, you wake up, you know a new language now.

Like what more could you want from this podcast, right?

And you could say, you know, like, why have my shipments not yet arrived?

Mr. Dietrich or something.

- I've got it, I've got it.

We

could call this Viewolingo.

- Great.

Which animal are we going to use as our mascot

to pester everyone for years

and then kill it really awkwardly online?

- The budgerigar that you've got.

Or the flamingo. - The flamingo.

- Well,

the flamingo's name is Wolfgang actually,

so that's perfect.

- This is

really coming together.

- I

think we've got something here.

- That was basically business corner without even trying.

So there you go, Andrew.

We just formed a corporation right there.

I'll just wrap up media media show.

There was this article about DVDs that were made improperly from Warner Brothers that

are basically just self-destructing themselves in the case because like the laminate is coming

apart or whatever.

So just another reminder to not only not rely on streaming but probably don't rely on this

like anything that's DRM media in general.

get that off of there and put it some way that you can have access to it because yeah,

that's yet again, we're like, well, I didn't buy the streaming version. I bought the DVD.

Yeah, well, the DVD self-destructed. So and this is not those DVDs from like back in 2005

or whatever. You all probably didn't see these, but we had there was some company, I forget

the name of it. Now they were red DVDs and they came in a a

like

hermetically sealed

case. So there was Netflix where you'd rent a DVD, it would come and you'd send it back.

This was literally one time use DVDs. This was somebody's idea that actually like was

in the market for at least eight minutes. It would come to you. And as soon as you cracked

the air seal, it started like a chemical clock of the DVD that would start degrading itself.

And then after like, I don't know, 24 hours or something, the disc was basically bricked.

It would not work anymore.

And you'd throw it in the garbage.

Like that was this company's plan.

The worst idea ever.

And it got pretty damn far.

So it's not that these are just normal DVDs that I think they made improperly.

So

back

up your media.

Environmental vandalism.

Corner.

We record this show.

We independently record our sides via WAV files, and then we package those up to a folder.

One of you grabs the three, puts them into your magic editing machine, does the edit,

it comes out great, you export as an MP3.

We're

gonna have to do FLAC.

Question.

Can you export?

We're already in WAV.

And you just do a wave export as well

so that I can start a new

lossless

feed

of hemispheric views.

I want waves so that I can do the,

I want the highest possible qualities

then I can export later.

- Can I ask a fairly blunt question?

Now that we're giving people insider access

to our behind the scenes decision-making processes,

how does that fit into our sustainability scheme

given the materiality of downloading files

of the larger

and

aren't compressed.

Do you foresee an issue in terms of energy usage

when it comes to this feed, Jason?

- I

do not, no.

- Given that one person will be doing it?

- Look, I'm happy to produce.

I am happy to produce.

This is my turn.

I'll produce the WAV file.

I don't reckon you'll spot the difference,

but I will do it.

- That's my biggest, I'm curious.

If we do, I would love to do an A/B just to see.

I just, I'm curious.

And I feel like it's already in WAV,

So it should just be like pick a different option, hopefully, right?

Jason can cover his ears for a second.

Andrew, here's the thing.

When you do it, do an alternative version that you export the WAV file, right?

And then it's like it just revealed this new audio, which is like, screw this shit.

Screw Jason for his stupid idea.

And he wouldn't hear it in the MP3 version.

It's like the anyway, Jason, you can uncover your ears now.

OK, cool. Thank you.

Also, a follow up question.

Do you keep these projects or did you guys just throw them all away?

I think they're all still in there mostly there are early ones that would be gone because of space issues or something but yes they're there they're just sitting there clogging up my audio hijack

not

only a hijack sorry what's it called.

Fair right.

Fair right that's it you Andrew.

Andrew's about to tell me he threw them all.

I threw a bunch away like they got too long and I'm just like delete delete delete.

Oh god.

Once is on my view my view.

I knew I should have been asking you for those.

My view is once it's produced, like the end result is the, it's the MP3.

That is the, the canonical version of this project.

Okay.

I have projects, Jason.

Do

they export as just like a packaged up thing?

You can export them as what's called an archive.

I think it's a project archive.

Cause I think there was one time that something stuffed up or I needed to use it on a different device.

So I went from one iPad to another or something.

And so that can transfer

between the apps.

I'm just a Viking. I'm just like burning down as I walk out of there.

Just like set it on fire. I'm out of here. I'm moving forward.

I

had, I had an idea to, to add to our, our archive page,

but it sounds like that may

not

go as well as I'd like.

Well, you can do it and you can just trumpet how fantastic I am.

Okay. All right. I'll do that.

I'll put a little counter up for how many that Martin kept and how many

Andrew kept.

So there's one topic left, which probably should have been at the top of the

show. This is followup actually. This is tech.

This is actually followup, but it's at the end. Okay.

So last episode, episode 132, I don't remember why,

but we did a poll

and

the poll was something to the effect of

who on the show sounds the best, I think,

or something to that effect.

And it was, that was it.

There was no further prompt.

We did the poll for seven days, I think,

and the poll ended.

And the outcome was meant to be

whoever was third

was

kicked off the show.

We talked to legal, we talked to HR.

It turns out that contractually we couldn't do that.

So kind of a spoiler.

But - But

what if you send him an email saying, what did you do for the last week? Is

that why? - Yeah,

I know. We're

still working through it. But needless

to say, the poll ended and the

results

were surprising. I thought I

was very surprised. Were the two

of you surprised in the outcome? Shocked.

Shocked.

No. - Horrified.

Martin?

- I

feel like.

Yeah. I mean, let's

be real. He was really invested in it.

- The poll was 20 votes. 20 votes.

Like it's not a huge quantifiable sample.

Sometimes that's all it takes.

It doesn't.

Once you get a certain number of votes, it just, it just, that is the pattern.

And like, you don't need more than that.

That's how they can, that's how they can do market research.

They, they poll a hundred people and that's all they need.

That's representative of 10,000 people.

Representative sample is 22.

Look, maybe it's from my wanky banging on before, like even with my research stuff.

I don't really place much emphasis or faith in any quantified stuff.

So I look at this and go, meh, but it appears we're kicking someone off the show,

maybe if legal allows it. So go on. What are the results?

Um,

yeah.

And I, but I'm, I was actually mostly curious and I didn't ask this cause that would have skewed it.

But

when

I asked the question, I think the three of us were thinking audio quality wise, like whose microphone sounds the best or whatever.

But in my head, I was really thinking it probably doesn't really matter.

It's really more whose voice

you

most either associate with

or don't associate with.

That was my thinking.

I don't know if I'm looking way too far into it.

- Well, that's another poll we have to do.

- Oh, follow on poll.

Okay.

We'll do that.

- And

we'll link to that in these show notes.

- Okay,

perfect.

We're doing a poll every show from now on,

whatever it is.

- Yes.

- So the results were Andrew,

Andrew

came in third.

Yeah. Yeah. And you know what?

Still

here. Like I said, we're talking to legal. It's, it's a thing we're working

through.

I voted for myself as well.

So really, really

a 20, 21, uh, 21 votes, I guess.

So I'm even worse. My performance is even worse.

We had Andrew at 25% of the vote. Uh, second place we had Martin.

Close, really close.

30% of the vote.

And then somehow I was first.

I don't agree with that at all.

45%.

Smashed us.

Wow.

Man, did not expect

that.

It's that authoritative American accent.

So Andrew, you voted for yourself, right?

Mm.

Yeah.

Oh, wait.

So.

No,

no.

- Well, look, I have a bombshell

just to make Andrew feel better about himself.

You and I were tied until I voted for myself

before the poll closed.

(laughing)

- Jason, is there something you wanna admit?

(laughing)

- And Jason made multiple accounts to spew his own.

- You

were both 25% and I was 50 then, is that right?

And then you voted for yourself to make it better.

Because I thought, I bet you Andrew's going to vote for himself.

You know me. You know me well.

Well, we couldn't have a tie.

But doesn't that mean, but doesn't that mean that the result is actually correct?

Yeah. Because we both voted for ourselves.

So, in doing so and cheating.

Hmm.

Hmm.

So, I made you feel better and also worse at the same time, Andrew.

Well, we will do a follow up poll to this one and then that will probably also do

absolutely nothing to the show, but we'll do it anyway.

And as a promise to listeners, this was an experimentally corrupt poll that we're talking

about. In the next one, no co-hosts of this show are allowed to vote. It's an honesty system.

I didn't vote.

This is for listeners only.

I did not vote.

Yeah, I know. You were fine, Jason, but we were criminals. So for the next one...

You

were fine, we were criminals.

It's which

voice. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For the next one, I promise I won't be, I hope Andrew will too.

it's which voice do you enjoy the most or associate with? No offense taken, people might think,

"God, Martin, he's just..."

No, it is anonymous, right? I wasn't lying. I don't think you can see

who voted for stuff, unless I don't know how this works, but I think it's anonymous.

But please,

listeners vote in the next one, and then we can have a genuine analysis

of

the next one.

That's going to be great. Okay. Self-esteem gone. Looking forward to it.

Cool. So, now this recording is over an hour and I've got to edit it down to 45 minutes.

This is going to be fun for me, isn't it?

Well, you can always cut stuff for oneprimeplus.com.

Oh, what was that segment that you missed?

It was so great.

Probably going to have to go to oneprimeplus.com and subscribe.

The very thing we told you never to do again.

But do it.

Exactly. And you know, it's great.

It wasn't good enough to be in the normal show.

So pay for it and get it somewhere else.

- Exactly.

(laughing)

- Well, I think someone's coming.

- What am I gonna cut out?

- Someone's coming, come here, come here.

Oh my goodness, we have a special guest at the last minute.

Oh, now I'm gonna have to put some earphones

into this special guest.

Can

you hear them?

- Hello, Mark. - Hi.

- Hello. - Who is it?

Introduce yourself, what's your name?

- Mac. - Mac.

- Mac.

- Have you been on a podcast before?

Do you have any questions for this child who now probably won't speak.

I

do. Martin, why are you holding a Lego mini fig?

Is

that what he looks like?

He's looking like a little Lego mini fig. His little shirt, his little hair.

Yeah, he looks great.

Oh,

with his hair.

Oh, do you like that?

Show them what's in your hand.

It's a batwing.

Isn't that what it's called? Like Batman's flying

like.

Is Batman inside it?

Use your words, they have to hear you.

Yes.

Yes. I love

Batman.

This is a great interview so far. What else would you like to ask him about Batman or other topics that are of interest to a three or four year old?

What did you have for

breakfast

today?

What did I have?

What

did you have? You put maple syrup on it.

Pancakes.

Oh, I love a pancakes.

You are so lucky. So lucky. I had a bowl of cereal.

That's not pancakes.

Did you have any berries? What cereal was it, Andrew?

What do they call it? That one that's good for your gut, the little sticks.

Captain Crunch.

All brand. All brand. That's the one.

All brand. You're a regular guy.

He's such an all brand guy.

How are your bowel movements, Andrew? Was it worth it? Was it worth eating cardboard for that?

When you get to your 40s, you've just got to do these things.

Noted. What cereal do you love that you have on Christmas Day specifically and other approved family days?

It's chocolate.

Rice Krispies. No, those aren't chocolate.

Cocoa Krispies.

So close Jason.

Cocoa Pops.

Cocoa Pops.

That's it.

Cocoa Pops.

That is excellent taste Mac.

They are so yummy.

Cocoa Pops are the best.

And then the milk.

What does the milk turn into?

Brown.

Brown.

Exactly.

Brown.

It

turns into

brown.

That sounds appealing.

I love a brown.

And

then you just drink that brown milk.

It's delicious.

Drink that brown.

Best brown you'll ever have.

Now to wrap up this wonderful guest appearance,

which is gonna Straw.

Straw.

Yeah, you drink through a straw, which is adding to Andrew's editing experience.

What did you just watch? This is MediCon. What did you watch on the TV with mum?

- Gruffalo.

- The Gruffalo.

- The Gruffalo,

the first one? Because there's a Gruffalo 2, isn't there?

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

- And what's the name of the little machine that plays the book for you? What do you listen on

with the cards?

- Hemispheric views.

Oh, wait, no, not yet.

- We

watched a movie.

- Yeah, but what do you listen to? What are the cards? What's the player?

The year, we

- Mario, mini fig

- Ah, three, two, one, stop.

- Get

to the chopper!
