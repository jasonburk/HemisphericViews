Andrew, this is a bit weird.

As we record, it's like a normal kind of evening time in Australia.

And we're missing someone.

Jason's in Japan, of all places.

Is this the first episode he's ever missed, I think?

Yes, it is.

I think it is.

The great irony is that he's actually in time zone terms.

He's closer to us than he has ever been.

And yet, this is the time it hasn't really worked out.

It's bizarre.

But I'm glad that he's actually enjoying his holiday.

And, I mean, it's nice when he's here.

But I look forward to hearing, you know, about the adventures on this podcast, on his blog, his numerous blogs.

We've already roasted one.

You know, something.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I hope he blogs.

He has been saying that he's away from keyboard.

I'm seeing a lot of AFK from him at the moment.

So, I don't know whether we're going to get anything from him in this episode or not.

He may provide a submission, a report from the field.

But we can't.

We just don't know.

Yeah.

I mean, this is his first ever, to use his absolute favorite word in the universe, sabbatical.

I'm pretty sure.

I'm pretty sure.

Like, there's like, I can't see it properly in the window that we're talking through right now.

But like a little red targeting sniper thing on my forehead.

I was like that.

He's tracked me down or he's got someone here.

I can't believe you said that.

I resisted and you did it.

Wow.

Impressive.

Because I know he's going to hate it.

I'm the foot.

He will hate it.

Look.

Look.

I know.

Foot.

I don't.

Look.

I don't think I'm a foot in all aspects of life.

But I have a.

Persona to live up to on this podcast, Andrew.

You've become the sensual co-host.

You're constantly recording from mattresses now.

You've gone beyond, like, above and beyond any other male tech podcaster before.

And you're actually on mattresses.

And I've got to live up to the foot status.

That's the thing.

This is what we do.

Speaking of mattresses, Martin, would you like an update on the Ghetto Studio?

What are we up to?

Like, D?

Maybe Ghetto Studio E by now?

I'm not sure.

I've had a few over the past few times.

It's a whole suite, basically.

Go for it.

Yes.

I'm seeing somewhere different.

It doesn't look like, you know, it's ghetto status.

It looks, you know, it looks quite nice.

But go for it.

Yeah.

No, no.

It's probably unfair to call it ghetto.

But it's certainly not a podcast studio at this point.

I am recording from another mattress.

It is a mattress.

It's a mattress upgraded, though.

I'm now recording from a king-size mattress.

It is your mattress.

You didn't just find someone else's mattress and just jump on it and start recording.

It's yours.

Correct.

Yeah.

Yeah.

It wasn't, like, junk collection.

It was a collection day around the neighborhood.

And I just went and found one lying on the side of the verge or anything.

This is my mattress.

Or like Marty McFly hopping through a window and just landing on someone else's mattress, but he thinks it's his.

Correct.

Correct.

No, this is my mattress.

King-size.

So, I've upgraded from a few weeks ago when I was on holiday.

I was on a child-size single.

So, I feel like I'm really moving up in the world.

Good.

Maybe, just maybe, one of these days I'll get back to, like, having a desk and, like, a microphone that's on an arm rather than being wedged.

Wedged into a blanket.

But here we are.

But, so, I'm happy.

Get a studio mattress is going well.

But, Martin, I'm not the only one with a mattress situation going on at the moment.

Yep.

Yep.

I think you need to admit what's going on in your situation.

Yeah, look, I'm not on a mattress, but a mattress is behind me.

And for, you know, listeners who can't see what we can currently see on our chat, we've had a whole debacle.

Over the last few years in our home.

Our home was built before the era of legally mandated or standardized waterproofing.

And so, the bathroom and the en suite, over time, leaked into and destroyed the carpet in three different rooms.

And it's just been this wonderful, you know, strata adventure of, you know, getting the bylaws passed and everyone on board to make this thing happen.

People were very cooperative, but the bureaucracy was difficult.

And here we are finally doing it.

But as part of that constant moving around, process is Jenga tower, Tetris kind of moving tile puzzle thing that is our lives.

The bed that I sleep on, the mattress that you are looking at right now, Andrew, is behind me in the study.

So, it kind of looks like a bizarre, sensual lounge situation that I've been teasing you about.

But now people are wondering why the hell is there a bed behind him?

So, yeah, it's just on that long journey.

You know, if we were to convert this to a video podcast, a vodcast, even, can you imagine our subscriber numbers?

Like, people would be paying a lot of Patreon money, a lot of One Prime Plus to see this in its reality.

See, I think you're being a bit optimistic, not about the viewer numbers.

I do think the viewer numbers would explode.

The audience would be huge.

But I think we get a lot of people who aren't really expecting what we're doing here.

I think they're going to get a different vibe of what the show is about from seeing these beds in the vodcast, as you call it.

Yeah, so maybe we should stick to just being a podcast.

Yeah, yeah, we'll do that.

And look, I mean, turning to the show notes, really, I'm kind of confused by what I can see here because there's a lot of stuff about Jason in here, and yet he's not here.

It says he's jet-lagged AF.

I'm not going to say that out loud on the podcast because I don't want to make you have to beep it.

He says the show notes will be iffy at best.

Now, look, this is something actually unprecedented in the show, and maybe listeners will appreciate this.

Jason's not here.

He's on holiday.

Who's doing the show notes?

I'm not.

Oh, shit.

So it's me now.

Well, they're just going to be absent.

Maybe they'll fit within the Apple Podcasts app limitation.

Oh, right.

It could be a good thing.

Yeah, so we'll see.

He always gets angry that Apple Podcasts truncates his show notes.

So maybe they'll just fit naturally.

Yeah.

Our show notes are too good anyway.

They're way better than everybody else.

If it does, maybe we should just, like, ease off on it a little bit.

Test the market.

I reckon Jason is more pissed off hearing that from you than he is with me for saying sabbatical.

We'll find out, won't we?

We'll find out.

No, I think I'm still in trouble.

But all the gold plating of these show notes, it's really unnecessary.

It's its own publication, really.

I think you could sell it as, like, a magazine or some sort of, you know, maybe like an academic journal even because it has that really heavy referencing thing, but without all of the structure of the, you know, Chicago or Harvard.

Do you reckon with his referencing, I remember early on in his show notes journey, he would link out to myriad different websites.

It could be a random blog, could be something, you know, some obscure site.

Do you think he's leaning too heavily on Wikipedia these days in his show note referencing?

That's a very good question because, look, Wikipedia, and I invite thoughts and feedback from listeners about this on Discord, Mastodon, Microdot, Blog, whatever tickles your fancy.

Wikipedia.

Wikipedia.

I think it's a bad rap, really, because when you look at it, it's a huge thing.

You've got all this referencing, and it will tell you, we think this needs some checking.

So, I'm not against Wikipedia in general, but look, if the show notes master is relying too heavily on Wikipedia, and maybe he is, I don't know, maybe it's time that you instigated an HR performance review.

Yeah, I think it might be necessary because I think he's resting on his laurels, and I think he perhaps has gone a little lazy.

Nobody's called him out on it.

He's been able to get away with it.

Mm-hmm.

He's thinking, nobody else is mentioning this.

I can just do a quick Wikipedia search, link it, and job done.

Yeah.

I just don't feel like he's putting, like, you know, you and I, when we edit this show, it's many hours of laborious work.

I feel like Jason might just be phoning it in.

Well, look, I think just for a start, I like the fact that you used the word laurels in that response to me just then, but I think you need to say it the way he would say it just to make sure the Northern Hemisphere is covered.

Oh, good.

Oh, wow.

How would he say it?

Rurals?

Laurels.

Laurels?

It's almost like rural Jura from 30 Rock.

Yeah.

I'm not sure what we're saying.

Are we going to do the hover conversation again?

Hover.

Hover.

Hover.

Okay, look.

I don't know why that's so hard.

We've completely alienated our absent co-host, which is great.

And maybe we'll get to the, I can see a basketball here.

Maybe we should cut to that.

What's this about?

Slash save.

What's working?

Oh, my goodness.

Slash save.

Now, you know, Martin.

I've been on the slash slave.

Slash.

Slash slave?

That's not me.

You can start that one again if you want.

I don't have a slash slave website.

I'm strongly against that.

But slash save, Martin Feld.

It's an amazing thing.

And you know what?

I have evidence proof, hard, cold, not so much cash, but an extra month of evidence that it works.

My setup code was used.

Oh.

To trigger a bonus for the purchaser and for myself.

An extra month of setup subscription to me and the purchaser for using my code.

So I just want to shout out a friend of the show, Rob Toobies, for using my setup code.

Totally out of the blue.

Out of the blue to me.

But of course, it was natural for him to just check out canyon.blog slash save to see if he could find himself a little bargain when he was looking to buy a set.

And it worked.

So I just think it's incredible evidence of the power of marketing and a slash save website.

Well, look, thank you to UK Ambassador for supporting Andrew's business corner of this podcast.

Because, I mean, I don't know if we'd call this a formal business corner, but setup, I mean, it is a business.

It's in your corner.

There are apps in there.

And look, I mean, you haven't mentioned setup for a while.

For people who are listening and are going, what the hell is that all about?

Or let's face it, people who listen to this do know what setup is.

I think they'd be curious.

What are you into at the moment on setup?

And how many of the same kind of app?

For example, note-taking.

Might you be?

No, I'm just trolling you.

What are you using at the moment?

Well, that's the problem with setup.

There's a number of note-taking apps.

And I do find myself conflicted.

Yeah.

You know what's interesting?

So I got setup when it first came out.

That's my claim to fame.

Like I was customer 003 or something.

And I've been on them ever since.

And I was on this grandfathered plan.

The 2Mac plan for a relatively low, low price.

And I've just never moved it.

Because they changed their pricing structure.

They respected my early purchase.

And I stayed on it.

But recently I realized that now their iOS offering has become compelling enough that I wanted access to that.

And my 2Mac or 3Mac plan or whatever it was.

3Mac plan, I think it might have been.

I don't know.

Maybe 2.

It doesn't matter.

You've got a lot of Macs flying around.

Yeah.

It's now just a 1Mac plan and a 2iOS plan.

So I got off my grandfathered plan.

So really for me, setup at the moment, I'm enjoying the cross-platform lifestyle with it.

And I want to give a particular shout-out to the app Structured.

Which, Martin, it's not a note-taking app.

It is a to-do task app.

I think I mentioned it earlier.

I might have mentioned it in the last show.

I'm still loving it.

So basically I get my tasks and I plan out my day.

And it tells me what to do.

It's very, very helpful.

I reckon listeners would appreciate.

I would appreciate.

Because we do make fun of you a bit when Jason's around for your whole knowledge management thing and how sometimes that knowledge, well, let's say it isn't managed because you don't know.

But- I've got a story about that too.

Oh, okay.

We'll get to that in a second.

But as far as tasks go, like are you doing like task revision every day?

Like is this a daily thing?

Or do you have segmented things for the week?

Like how much do you kind of break it down or look ahead?

Is it all in the same pool?

Like what's going on here?

I think people would be interested to see inside the mind of Andrew Canyon at this point.

Okay.

Okay.

So broadly speaking, I have two large scale.

I'm going to talk OmniFocus, right?

Because OmniFocus is basically how my brain is structured.

I have home and I have work.

And what I'll do is I'll focus on either one of those, depending on the frame I'm in.

Sometimes I've tried playing around with focus modes with iOS and linking the focus modes to that.

But I find that a little bit frustrating because inevitably I want the thing that isn't focused.

But yeah, so every single task I have is in that app.

Every single obligation, whether that's to myself or to somebody else is in that thing.

So every day I'm living in that app.

I'm breaking down.

I've got projects.

I've got projects for all my main areas.

If it's work, you know, and they're really defined projects, I have those.

And I do a work breakdown structure basically and put them down into actionable next tasks as the David Allen GTD way would have it.

It's become such an internalized process.

It's how I think about everything.

So that's kind of, so, you know, I'm looking at my, from my personal perspective, I actually changed it and I call it be a good is my folder.

And I, and then within that I have folders, Andrew, dad, partner, homeowner, podcaster.

So be a good Andrew.

What does it take to be a good Andrew?

What does it take to be a good dad?

What does it take?

And within each of those folders are projects and broken down and within those projects are tasks and they'll have different repeating schedules.

So I have, you know, I have a lot of things that I do.

I have a lot of things that I do.

I have a lot of things that I do.

I have dealing with medications and prescriptions and all that kind of thing.

Everything is laid out in OmniFocus, carefully structured and they bubble up in their forecast, in the forecast view when it's time to do them pop up.

So you've essentially loaded in your own kind of motivational self-help message about how to be a good version of your various personas and roles in the very software that you use.

Like you're motivating yourself through the names of these folders or things in the hierarchy.

Yeah.

So you, correct, correct.

Because sometimes you lose focus of why you're bothering to do these things and you need to like take a step back and say, no, I'm doing this because I want to be a good father to my children.

That's why I'm doing this stuff.

Now, for many people that probably comes, it's probably obvious, but sometimes when you're caught in a rut, you're like, ah, it's just another thing I've got to do.

I've got to contact the school to arrange this form, which is so, you know, feels meaningless and just bureaucratic and it's worth it.

It's the worst form.

And you're like, no, I'm doing this because I want to be a good dad and it needs to be done.

So I'm just imagining you, it's like a 43 degree Celsius summer day in Perth.

You've walked away with your kids locked in the car and you've gone, what's that?

And you've looked at your software and you've gone, ah, be a good dad, turn around and you let them out.

Yeah.

No, you just crack the windows a little bit.

Just a little bit.

Okay.

While you pop in the wall.

Yeah.

No, no, look, I jest.

But that's interesting.

And I can't, has this come up before?

I don't know if we've had that kind of look into, into your motivational psyche.

Probably not in that level of detail.

I think, I think you usually take the piss out of me before we get to that level of detail.

I think I'm being a little bit kinder today.

Yeah.

I should flip it and say, also, each of these tasks have a context or a tag attached to it as well.

So I can look at it from a different perspective.

So if I want to see everything to do with my son, David, I just look at the David tag.

Oh, there's all the things we've got to do together or for him or what have you.

The waiting tag is great whenever you assign something to somebody else and then you're waiting for it to come back.

Just give it a waiting tag and then you can quickly look up and see what you're waiting on.

It means, you know, those annoying, particularly at work, you know, those annoying things when people say, oh, I didn't, I didn't get that email.

Oh, I'm sure you didn't send it to me.

Yeah, you definitely did.

Check the waiting tag.

And then you assign a defer date to the point where you assigned, where you sent it.

You sent that email, you assign a defer tag to that timestamp and then you can say, no, actually, on the 4th of October at 1257, I know that I sent that email.

And you can backtrack and then you can track it into your, if you haven't got a hyperlink back to your email, you can even just track it, just search for it and find it back in your history because you know that you assigned that defer tag and that timestamp.

So this is amazing because I know we've covered stuff like this before, but do you know what my system is?

Oh, God.

Probably a sticky note, sticky notes app.

Yeah, not quite.

Look.

What I'll say is that, okay, if it's something like folders and files and stuff, they're organised.

You've got the finder, things are in places that make logical sense, very organised.

But when it comes to the art of to-dos or reminders or tasks like daily life, other than plonking, let's say, some bullet points in tot for things that might be coming up or, you know, hey, that thing, dingus, as people say, remind me on this day of this, I just don't do it.

Like, I'll put something down and I'll walk away and I'll just remember to do it and forget that I set the reminder for myself to do it.

But you will remember it.

Yeah.

It stays active in your brain.

Pretty much.

See, I don't know if, is that like a superpower that other people have that I don't have or?

I forget things, don't get me wrong, but it's like any time I try to use a to-do list or some sort of task-based thing, I find the doing of that to be so laborious and annoying or that I forget to do it, that I just do the work.

Wow.

Okay.

That was a strange kind of motivation.

Not having a go at you.

Yeah.

It's just like, I'll do this.

It's fascinating.

See, what if you forget, if you forget to do something, you literally, you honestly forget, do you beat yourself up?

Do you say, oh, I'm really annoyed with myself that I forgot to do that thing?

Like.

Look, it depends.

If it's for family, right?

If I've, oh, I've left it to the last minute or something, then yes.

Because I find that personally significant.

But when it comes to work, yes, work is important, but quite often people are forgiving or there's a reason for it or you apologize or quite often deadlines, I would say, are made up.

Yes.

Do you know what I mean?

There are some things in life, and I'm speaking from the position of being in a job where, you know, I love what I do and I'd like to think that what I do is important, but, you know, it's not like I'm working in a hospital where this surgery has to happen right now to save this person's life.

Yeah.

If it happens the next day and there's good justification and people are forgiving, then that's fine.

So, no, I don't beat myself up about it.

Yeah.

I think I hold myself to too high a standard because I feel like if I forget to do something or, you know, I haven't renegotiated that thing, I feel like I'm a personal failure and it's like, I've let myself down.

I've let the organization down.

I should need to go give myself some, you know, good thinking time about how I can do things better.

I think I hold myself down.

I think I hold myself to too high a standard because I wouldn't hold anybody else to that same standard.

Yeah.

But you can hold yourself to a high standard, but you don't have to, like, be ashamed.

Do you know what I mean?

That's what I'm working on.

Okay.

This has turned into a lovely therapy session.

Yeah.

People, I don't know if people are sticking around or leaving at this point.

They're like, where's the American who, you know, plays them off each other?

What the hell's going on with this show?

Hemispheric what?

Hemispheric snooze, more like.

But I've got to get back to you about that point.

You took the piss out of me for my note.

Taking.

So, Martin.

Oh, yeah.

I've changed locations as sort of suggested.

My location has changed.

And with it has changed my smart bulbs.

Oh.

We're talking about appliances, not like a personal.

Correct.

Correct.

And not flowers, bulbs, flowers.

No, we're talking about LIFX bulbs, which suck.

Do not buy them.

And Phillips Hue bulbs.

Okay.

So, the Phillips Hue bulbs, no big drama.

They connect to their little.

Home hub thingamabob they've got.

It's an older technology style, I think.

But it works way more reliably.

I'm totally.

If I need more, I'm buying Phillips all the way.

I'm trying to phase out these LIFX bulbs, which operate as their own independent Wi-Fi unit, each one.

And then you've got the pain in the butt.

Pair it to your home app.

Okay.

That's cool.

You need like an eight digit code for each bulb to pair it.

Okay.

So, I've got a little bit of a problem.

Into the home app?

No problem, Martin Feld.

I know I recorded each of those numbers that was on the packaging, which is long gone.

But I know I recorded it into a note.

Do you know where I'm going with this?

I don't know if it is, hey, you, Martin Feld.

I showed you because I have the information recorded.

Or it's, I have no idea where it is because it's in this grandfathered plan from this sixth version of something that I forgot that I had or something.

Yeah, it's more like a ladder.

It's like.

Okay.

I know I can even visualize the note that I had.

And I remembered.

I wrote that in craft.

I don't have craft installed.

It is an app in setup, but I don't have it installed.

But that's okay because I'm sure I migrated all those notes out and put them somewhere else.

Where did I put them?

Honestly, craft.

When you say craft, it's like, I remember.

Listeners, look.

I know where you're going, Martin.

It's like Jason and Andrew say craft.

Is the bees knees.

You have no option but to use craft.

This is the way forward for hemispheric views.

And Martin goes, are you sure?

I feel like this is a bit of a fad.

Well, how much do I hear about craft these days?

Zilch.

Okay.

Zilch.

This joke's about bear and there's stuff about this and that and oh, Apple notes.

And then what's this proton waja, Satria, Jumbuck stuff that Jason's on now.

But no craft still limping along.

And I was like, do I need a subscription?

I don't know if I do.

It's free.

Is it?

I don't know.

So anyway, so you've lost your shit in craft, Andrew.

That's it.

I lost it.

So I couldn't find it.

Couldn't find in craft.

And then I looked through a couple of other notes apps.

Couldn't find it there.

I was sure I'd migrated them all to notebooks.

Didn't find it there.

And I was like, oh, hang on bear.

I paid for a year of bear because I was pumped for that.

I'm pretty sure it's, but I'm not using bear anymore, but I've still got my subscription.

And I looked in bear, found it in bear.

It's fantastic.

So that's great.

I needed to update.

Well, that, okay.

Well, that light bulb is now in a different spot.

I need to keep my note up to date.

So I notated it in bear and then realized, well, hang on, what's the fricking point of that?

Because I'm not using bear anymore.

That's just where I found the information.

It was a cold moment.

And you know what I'm doing?

You know what I've been doing recently, Martin?

Okay.

Just brace yourself.

I am bracing myself.

I've been thinking probably Apple notes is probably the best place for this stuff.

Right.

Now it doesn't do markdown.

It's kind of annoying because I wish I don't like the font, but at least I know where everything is and it syncs reliably.

And it's just there.

I say power to you.

You and Jason were like, Oh, Martin, your defaults note user.

And I'm like, well, I don't know.

You are, you love it.

And I'm like, I don't care.

And now suddenly you're both turning around to it.

I have no idea what's going on, but if you want to use Apple notes, you go for it.

And you know, I might start fresh.

I may not migrate all my past historical notes.

I think I'm just going to say, right, line in the sand.

I'm a new person.

Apple notes from this point forward.

Now see what's hilarious about that is that you're walking into the exact same situation that you just told me about before in the story where you're going to have to try to find that thing on the packaging that is in the old notes thing.

Cause you didn't migrate everything.

I thought, damn it's not in notes.

But what do you do?

Life's complicated.

I don't know what to do.

And I can't be bothered doing another migration.

Cause I was like, it might've been in log seek, but I'm not reinstalling log seek to try and find a note.

Martin, it was a, it was a sad time.

Well, good luck with that.

Speaking of which we actually had a request and through an email from a dedicated listener suggesting that it might be time for a, uh, update of our defaults.

Uh, default apps like a re a refresh.

I don't know.

What do you, do you have a feeling about that?

It's uh, well, look, I'm not sure how much has changed and I'm not sure if it justifies an entire repeat episode, but I do think it's a worthwhile question.

It's a good suggestion.

So thank you very much.

And um, yeah, when Jason has returned, maybe we can revisit it and see what's changed.

And um, you know what he's going to have, what's that?

He's going to, he's going to have found some Japanese note taking app that probably, you know, has text from right to left.

And he'll say, no, but guys, this is the way of the future.

That's my eyes will roll out the back of my head or actually the wrong way around to sit, you know, the other way around, you know, now on that point, should we hear from Jason?

I think he might've said something in, oh, let's let's listen in.

We have no idea what's going to happen.

Jason, are you there?

Now we have no idea what we just heard, but I think it was great.

I think it's great too.

We may not have heard anything at all.

That might just be a vacant pregnant pause.

Cause he didn't bother.

Maybe he said something in Japanese.

We have no clue until you edit this and put it out.

Do you know what I do have to say to Jason though?

What's that?

Arigatou gozaimasu.

That was very convincing.

Oh, I wonder if Jason's doing anything, any lean manufacturing work while he's over there.

I don't know.

I think that's top of his priority and not, not photography or food or, you know, general travel things.

Lean manufacturing.

I really do hope he checks out a factory or two.

I think he could learn a thing or two.

Now I have something for you, Andrew, that I think we need to do to wrap up this special episode with Jason away.

You like biscuits, right?

I love a biscuit.

I actually love them too much.

It's dangerous.

Yeah.

I was thinking, what should we talk about on the show?

And my very wise and beloved Natasha said, you've got two Australians on the show.

You need to talk about Arnott's biscuits.

And I went, that is totally thematically appropriate because what was the very first ever official episode of this show about?

It was called Tim Tam slams, disregarding for a sec, you know, triple zero, the, uh, the pilot and look, Jason's into Tim Tams.

He's tried biscuits and all that sort of thing.

Um, we're talking like cookies for all American listeners or people in the North, in the Northern hemisphere.

But he wouldn't have delved as deeply into the Arnott's world as you and I would have as Australians, right?

It's really Australian, New Zealand thing.

And uh, look, they've rejigged things over time at Arnott's, you know, there is no substitute for quality and they've, you know, rejigged the assortment.

So I thought it would be interesting based on Natasha's suggestion.

I want to know Andrew, and I'm going to say as well, what is your favorite Arnott's biscuit from the creams and family favorites assortments.

And from there, you can rank and mention others.

But we're going to bring up this webpage now together, if you have it there and listeners, you can look at the show notes that we hope will be there because Jason isn't here.

Oh God.

Um, and there should also be a picture there in the list.

So Andrew, I'm going to interrogate you at this point.

This is potentially very controversial.

There are rankings online about all this stuff and it gets quite heated.

Um, what are your thoughts?

We've got the cream favorites and the family favorites.

Now I'm going to read out the names and people can follow along at home.

Uh, in the variety.

We have the Delta cream, the shortbread cream, the Kingston, the Monte Carlo, and the Delta Jaffa cream discuss the Delta Jaffa cream.

Is that a new, a new addition to the lineup?

I feel like it might be.

I'm a little bit put off by that, but we've got to try to limit it here.

Okay.

Didn't it used to have, cause I feel like the Delta Jaffa cream may have just, uh, replaced that orange one, which would be the same kind of thing.

I think it's just a different, a different flavor.

I think it's just a different flavor.
