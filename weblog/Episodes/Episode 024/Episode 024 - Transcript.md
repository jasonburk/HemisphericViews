I have some, so we're talking about food now.
I have some secret food technology information that I'm not sure I'm allowed to share with the world
for fear of a big avocado coming down on me.
But I feel like I want to share it and just risk the consequences.
So...
Hemispheric Views is proudly supported by SurgeSafe IPS,
the number one interruptible power supply.
Do you experience frustrating and dangerous electrical surges,
brownouts, and other intermittent power supply issues?
Are you worried that your computers and other precious hardware devices may be negatively
impacted by unsteady electricity?
Worry no more with the amazing new SurgeSafe IPS, the number one interruptible power supply.
You're probably familiar with uninterruptible power supplies that beep, screech and give
you mere seconds to power down devices and drain their own batteries in seconds.
The SurgeSafe takes a better approach.
It disconnects your power immediately whenever unstable power is detected.
This patented immediate shutdown technology ensures your precious devices are kept safely
from poor quality power.
SurgeSafe shuts down all electricity within milliseconds upon detecting unreliable power.
It's like pulling the plug out of the wall, but done in a safe and managed way.
Our thanks to SurgeSafe for their support of Hemispheric Views.
Beautiful.
Well look, I'll talk briefly about the games that I'm nostalgic about, that I've been reminiscing
about a little bit.
And pretty much all of them except for a board game which I will mention now that you've
opened the floodgates on that one, Jason.
They're all from the original Power Macintosh that my family had when I was a kid.
Your phone is smart.
Even your refrigerator is smart nowadays, yet your shoes are still stuck in the past.
That all changes today with the revolutionary breakthrough of Kats by Nike.
That's cat and the number 5 pronounced cats.
Kats are running shoes from the future that are available in the present.
With Kats you can connect a single ethernet cable to either the left or right shoe for
all day performance and speed.
With the included ethernet cable you can run up to 100 meters in any direction from your
home without worry. Or add the Nike repeater to double your range. After wearing Katz you
will wonder, "Where has this been all my life?" Get Katz today and run faster than
you ever have. Use code "I would like a discount on Nike Katz because I heard the
ad on Hemispheric Views." All one word, camel cased. Our thanks to Nike and Katz for sponsoring
Hemispheric Views.
Bonded Pair technology coming later in 2021. Offer not valid anywhere. Warranty void if
used with non-Nike branded ethernet cables and/or accessories.
As kindergartners or maybe in year 6 we were playing this game and my father thought it
would be funny to hide around the corner from the study and yell things like "help, I'm
stuck in the library" and if you know anything about this game you're tracking down people
who are missing in some sort of magical book and we're thinking "oh my god, they're in
the library" so we're pursuing these spirits that don't even exist while my dad's taunting
us from the next room. Today, we're excited to announce three amazing new services by
Hemispheric Views. A revolutionary custom made spreadsheet plan, a tailored app deletion
program and a series of unrequested personal anecdotes. Spreadsheets, app deletion, and
anecdotes. Spreadsheets, app deletion, and anecdotes. Are you getting it? These are not
three separate services, they are one convenient service bundle and we are calling it Hemispheric
Views One Prime Plus. Hemispheric Views One Prime Plus combines three amazing hemispheric services
into one easy subscription. Get a plan that's right for you, your business, or your whole family.
The first integrated service is brought to you by Andrew Canyon, and he calls it
Spreadsheet Everything. Whether it's a shopping list, creative manuscript, or a simple birthday
message, you can submit it to Andrew and he will transform it into a spreadsheet in the
file type of your choice. As a personal touch, upon request he will print it and send it
to you via Australia Post. If you're lucky, you'll get it this year. Second, Jason Burke
is known for having way too many apps on his iPhone. With this in mind, he'll use his extensive
experience to cull the apps on your personal device. Whether it hasn't been used in years
or simply has a hideous icon, never fear. He'll just get rid of it without asking you
how important it is. Send your iPhone via Australia Post and hopefully Jason will receive
it to complete the service. Last but not least, Martin Feld is the master of telling you stories
that you never asked or wanted to hear, often about foreign language films. Now you can pay
him for it. Registering through iMessage, every day Martin will send you a surprise anecdote
that may or may not bear any actual relevance to your life. Let the stories flood in and pretend
to feel enlightened just to save face. Starting from an individual plan at $49.99 per month,
our service bundle launches today at hemispheric views.com. hemispheric views one prime plus,
whether you're up here or down there, you have no excuse not to sign up.
So I'm thinking about selling this as a thing at the farmer's market,
but then I feel a little bad that I'm literally selling snake oil in the form of water. So...
Do you use a computer? Does it live up to your expectations? Does it let you down?
Every once in a while a piece of software comes along that fixes everything. All core cloud
decentralized connected distributed platform technology is that software. That thing that
that annoys you when you open that other app? Fixed. That one time that thing happened that
caused other stuff to happen? Fixed. Can't get something to work? Fixed. Too many things
happening? Fixed. Stop doing and start being. All core. Doesn't actually do anything and
isn't even real. Blockchain.
This conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.
