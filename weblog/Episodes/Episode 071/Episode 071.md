Welcome everybody to Hemispheric Fuse episode 71. 71, can you believe it?
I can't believe it.
I'm a little bit punchy today my co-hosts are not so punchy Jason Burke is almost asleep as we speak and Martin Feld is looking at me like what is going to Andrew today.
He's a little bit too excited a little bit.
Martin has a tiny coffee Martin has a tiny coffee it is having a tea party coffee with all his little friends not the reason I'm so punchy is because we have just discovered that November.
Is no longer November gentlemen it's been renamed it is now.
Nick Nick member wow okay cool other make sense so alright I'm I'm.
Feeling we should workshop the name a little but I'm I'm picking it up go ahead.
How about need to remember me remember sounds neater and still an ode to the man can I say why.
Can I now that you've done the whole intro can I just walk in on and push you aside and tell everybody what's going on?
What we have today is a
Special guest not only the creator the owner and chief fun person
from
the one and only
WTF dot BBQ is here today. Okay. Is that you're giving me a look? Why are you giving me a look?
Is that wrong?
No, this is like the RSS thing again, all over again.
Oh, rss.net.
Sorry, my mistake.
It's omg.lol.
Obviously, everybody knew that from NeatFember, because everybody celebrates now every year.
Welcome Adam from Omgulol.
Hello.
Thanks for having me back.
Is that the most convoluted introduction you've ever had in any?
No, I'm not really...
I'm not often introduced to anything. So I'll take it simple complex convoluted
Backwards, it's all good. I
Think you sit in there thinking are they talking about me? And when do I get to say?
Well Andrew alluded to neat vember
right because before we started
We were given the piece of information that we already knew obviously because we you know, we're well researched
We study everyone that comes on the show. We know we plan this show
Yeah, it's very well planned. It's very thorough a year ago. We had Adam on to talk about on galol
1.0 and now out of no coincidence we have him back for on galol
2.0
And we wanted to talk about it and chat about it because we all use it
Everybody uses it everybody should use it and we all love it. So why not have him on to talk about
omg.lol 2.0 and the many great things that it has to offer.
And for those just quickly who haven't heard that episode or don't know Adam's work,
Adam, can you give us a rundown on who you are and what omg.lol or omglol actually is?
Yeah, well, I'll try. So yeah, I'm a kind of indie software developer. I live in Louisville,
Kentucky, which I did not pronounce correctly. Everybody in this area is probably mad at me
right now. It's pronounced "Louisville" if you live in this area. Yeah, and I've done this for
about three and a half years now just as a side gig. I'm gainfully employed. I have a day job.
It's kind of a corporate jobby job type thing. But this is my passion. This is my
sort of hobby project turned nonstop full-time devoted hobby project. Full-time nights and
weekends, I guess. And yeah, I started it about, like I said, three and a half years ago. It
started as really just with the domain. I was just out doing the thing I do, looking for domains and
found this really neat one. And I was like, oh, this would be great for an email address.
and started the service really as an email forwarder. And then a week into the service,
I said, "Oh, let me tack on like a webpage. You could do a webpage with it as well."
And yeah, those were the humble beginnings, a simple webpage and forwarding your email address.
And I've just kind of bolted onto it. It's like the Weasley's house in Harry Potter,
like just one edition after another. And I just keep adding more stuff to it. But it's a lot of
of fun. I'm going to keep on adding stuff to it. I have a lot of fun with it. I put it out there
for people to use. And so far, it mainly attracts pretty nice, kind people, which is wonderful.
Haven't really had to deal with too much riffraff, although there's been a little. But yeah, it's
just a fun project that I love working on. Is it my imagination or in the year intervening,
since we spoke to you last, has it, it really feels like it's accelerated and there's sort
of becoming a bigger awareness of the site. I'm not going to say it's mainstream because it isn't,
and nor would you probably want it to be, but it feels like there's momentum building around it.
There is, yeah. It's definitely like an organic, a slow but definitely growy organic growth. I
don't know. This is where my business vocabulary is going to fall apart. The number is going up
on the chart, I guess. I actually made a chart for the first time a couple days ago when somebody
urged me to. I'm just all about the development, all about keeping the servers running, keeping
the bugs squashed, keeping things going. I don't spend nearly as much time on the business side or
on the analytics. But somebody said, "Hey, what's the growth activity look like?" And so I just
plotted that really quickly and simply. And yeah, it's a pretty steady increase, which is great.
But no, to your point, Andrew, I think I'd be kind of freaked out if it got overly popular
or went overly mainstream.
I'm just one person.
I get enough email about it as it is to kind of keep me pretty busy and things are pretty
well balanced out right now.
It'd be cool if more people knew about it than used it.
But I like the growth rate being where it is.
I hope it stays that way somehow.
this podcast, we're going to 10x your growth rate, we're going to have a hockey stick chart.
And oh boy, just don't worry about the don't worry about the business stuff.
We'd never talk about business anything here.
So it's completely fine.
We force it into a corner that comes up occasionally.
You may know. I think, Andrew, correct me if I'm wrong, the term he was looking for is up and to the right.
Is that that's the technical term for what you're looking for?
Yeah, that's that's the quadrant we want to be heading into.
Yeah, you've got, yeah, we've got a whole, like, you want to get into the blue ocean area.
And a blue ocean.
Okay.
And you don't want to be competing.
You want to find.
I'm familiar.
There you go.
Hey, he's familiar.
Familiar with the blue ocean.
It seems tautological.
Are there, are there any other colors for ocean other than a bit of a murky green on a different day?
Well, the premise behind the blue ocean is that you want to avoid the red ocean, the bloody shark infested waters of competition and, and.
excuse my ignorance there. And look, just full disclosure for listeners, the three of us here are
omg.lol customers. We very much enjoy it, but this isn't some super freaky sponsor paid relation
thing. We just want to have you on the show because we think it's cool. Jason, at the
beginning before I, I think slightly hijacked it, was mentioning 2.0. Things are going on.
What has happened in OMG.lol land?
Why are you here?
- So yeah, so the service was limping along.
It was the Weasley house that I was talking about
for the longest time.
And it still kind of is, but--
- Sorry, if you're limping, sorry to interrupt.
I told you I was punchy.
If you're limping, Martin can probably help you
out with the foot.
(laughing)
Sorry, carry on.
I'm so punchy today.
- Also, downward pressure comes from the film.
Not much support.
His idea of a thing limping along, like services should wish to be limping along in that respect.
It's very, very good. Limping from a technological standpoint, because basically the first version
of this service was just a whole bunch of things that were kind of glued together in a not so
thoughtful way. And the rewrite focused on an actual, like, mature, responsible set of
APIs that everything is built around. So, and it's not 100% perfect. And I wasn't able
to stick with the philosophy flawlessly. But in general, almost everything you can do in
the UI now, you can also do programmatically with an API. And the UI uses the very same
APIs and it's a really nice setup overall now with that sort of API centricity.
And it's definitely more reliable.
It makes it easier to add and build onto things.
But also, you know, I haven't gotten around to coding the API rate limits yet.
So this is the problem of being an independent developer is you just kind of do the best you can with what you have.
and there's always more to do.
So I want to roll out new features.
The last thing I want to do is work on rate limiting,
but you know, somebody emailed me the other day
and was asking about rate limits and they were like,
does this mean we can do anything?
And like, kind of, but not really.
Yeah, but that's what 2.0 is all about.
- I know Adam's not going to go through the laundry list
of everything that's included with omg.lol,
so I'm going to do it for him.
If you'll spare me four and a half minutes
to go through the list of everything that's included
in one of these great services.
So he mentioned the email, he mentioned the webpage,
which I'm trying to remember back to a year.
It feels like there were a few more things
than just those a year ago,
but I don't exactly remember now.
There may have been a few other little things tacked on,
but since then we've got status log,
which kind of came out of left field a little bit.
That was like, I feel like you had the idea on a Tuesday
and then like Wednesday it was fully implemented.
So that happened recently.
You've got your paste bin in there.
You've got pearls, whatever that stands for, uh, email, which we talked about.
DNS control over all this stuff.
So it's not even just like surface level, pretty stuff.
There's all this like wacky nerd stuff underneath that you can do switchboard,
which I haven't even touched on yet, where you can route things in all kinds
of weird ways, soon to be a blogging platform as well, because why not?
It's got IRC, in case you remember the 1990s.
It's got Mastodon, in case you remember last week.
And I feel like that's maybe not even the whole list,
but that gives you an idea of the kinds of things
and the depth at which these things are added.
Where it's not just, I wanna add X,
and then you get a little lowercase x tacked on.
It's like, I wanna add x,
and then a novel appears the next day.
It's crazy how well-defined and just broad these features are when you would not expect that from just, especially from something called OMG.lol.
You expect to show up and there'd just be like a little animated gif of like a cat laughing at you or something.
And it's like, no, there's all these like hardcore like nerd services, but they're friendly and easy to use for anyone.
So I think that is somewhat of a representation description of what 2.0 is right now.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
That's really nice, Jason.
That's that you're too kind in your description.
No, seriously, it's, um, you, you, you did a really wonderful job.
Perl, by the way, stands for permanent URL.
There you go.
And I, I didn't invent that term.
It's a term like older than all of us, I guess.
I don't know.
Um, but yeah, no, that's, yeah, this, this new version on top of the APIs, it does
have those other little bits and bobs that you were talking about there.
And I'm really happy with how most of them have turned out.
I mean, there's still a million things I want to do.
The blogging is going to be really fun.
I'm doing it mostly because I need a blog.
I need something for release notes.
I mean, I'm not much of a blogger.
I've tried.
I've been on microblog.
I posted like two things, hated them, deleted them.
I'm not really good at the whole blogging thing.
Never have been, I've tried so many times over the years.
But now I do need a way to share my own
kind of lame serialized content.
And as usual, it's like, well, if I'm gonna use it,
I may as well put it out there for others.
But I'm a little bit afraid about the blogging thing
'cause I've gotten a bunch of emails,
I've gotten a bunch of DMs.
People are like, oh, tell me more about this.
What's it gonna do?
What features is it gonna have?
and I'm like, well, it's gonna let you put words on a screen.
I don't intend to compete with any of the other
blogging places out there or any of the services
that are all grown up and know what they're doing.
This will just be simple, lighthearted, fun.
I might try to put a few fun spins on some things
if I can figure out a way to do that.
But for the most part, it's gonna be pretty plain.
I guess that's kind of an overarching theme
for a lot of this stuff is it's pretty plain.
I try to make it fun, but it's simple at its core, I guess.
- So Martin mentioned we all use it.
It was, this is all Andrew's fault, right?
That we found this to begin with?
I'm trying to remember how this happened.
- It is, but it's not really me.
So I found it, but I didn't find it of my own volition.
It came through a friend of ours on microblog, Mike Madera.
That's how I found about it. - Oh, yeah.
Okay, that's right.
Yeah.
And he was going on about this OMG to LOL and he's a lovely guy.
I'm thinking, what's he, you know, he's, he's got pretty good taste.
And I was like, well, if he likes it, it must be something to it.
And I, I went to the site and was like, Oh, I can see why Mike likes this.
There's pink everywhere.
It's very colorful and it's probably not for me.
And then I dug into it.
I was like, actually, this is kind of cool.
This is, this is nice.
This is, there's a lot beneath hiding beneath the covers.
And it's just and so then I I think I shared it with you guys we talked about it Adam has become like a good friend
I think and
He's just watching this thing grow. So I think it's awesome. And
Yeah, I think and the thing is I think actually
What a dot what push me over the line originally was I'm an economic rationalist. We all know that
Yeah, we go. He didn't just have a low low price
He had a stupid price it was stupid it's stupid as of right now he's got a really really stupid price so yeah reverting back to business corner I think we need to we need to workshop his.
You know his is economic model do you think we can convince him to change that by say January 1st 2023 just to throw it in a short time limit if anybody can do it.
Look, if we can just say this up front, if we let's just get into this, Adam, when you
entered the podcast recording studio today, our little virtual room here, did you come
in here seeking business consultation?
No, I will.
I will take it where I can get it because no, seriously, I, I learned so much from,
other people every single day and I'm not very smart with this kind of stuff.
So, so seriously, like bring it on.
No, I did in all seriousness, I did, I did have this stupid price going for a while,
way too long.
And yeah, Jason, like you pointed out, it's still going on.
And we can edit that out.
No, you don't have to.
It's it's it's yeah, it's it's a ridiculous price.
It's priced at what, I don't know, I just,
I know all of the problems, all the cracks, all the flaws,
and back to that point about it being pretty ultra simple
at the end of the day, like I don't know,
I tend to underestimate the worth
or the value of things like that.
But I finally did kind of wake up one day not that long ago
and sort of see the light that it is time
to put something that's somewhat more reasonable
of a price on it.
So yeah, I've picked a higher price.
That's gonna go into effect January 1st.
It's still probably too low,
but it's more than what it is today,
so I'm happy with that.
- I don't think you're too different
than most people that make things, though.
I mean, it's very difficult to assign a value
to something that is actually a fair value
when you are so inside this small circle
that is just yourself and everything about it.
You know everything that's wrong with it.
You know everything that's right with it,
but at the same time,
we all tend to undervalue our own efforts.
So we're joking, obviously, about it being a stupid price,
but that's how these things generally go.
And back when you first started it
and it was only an email thing,
that price made sense
for just having email forwarding, right?
Like you wouldn't be like,
"It's $50 a month to forward email."
People would be like, "What the hell?
"I'm not doing that, that's insane."
But then as you started tacking on more and more stuff,
it's like time to reassess
and that's how we grow products.
So I think that makes a lot of sense.
So to be clear, today it's $5 a year.
- I told you it is cheap.
- Everybody thought I was gonna say like per week
or something, no, a year.
But it sounds like we've convinced him to change the price
as of January 1st, 2023.
And if you would like to, you can share that new price
unless that's still under consideration.
- No, it's pretty much a done deal.
It's just going up to $20 a year,
which I say that out loud and I immediately hate it
'cause it's like, oh no, it's four times the current price,
which seems ridiculous.
But I went out there the other day,
I poked around, I looked at similar services,
different link and bio services
and other little simple,
like build a fun webpage kind of things.
And they're all like 25 a month
or $30 a month or premium for $45 a month.
It's like, what's going on?
Like, are people even really paying that?
I don't believe people are actually paying that
for any of these things, but maybe, I don't know.
But no, I think I'm definitely more fairly competitive,
I guess, at this point.
And I'd also like to think I have just a few more fun tools
on the Swiss Army knife
than some of these other places have.
But yeah, I don't know.
I mean, ultimately people will pay
what they think it's worth, I guess.
And if, hopefully people will find it worth that amount.
And if not, then I'll figure something out, I guess.
Sorry, I like the way that you said Swiss Army Knife
'cause that was actually the term
that was in my head to bring up
because for people who are maybe less technically inclined
or haven't used your service,
when I first came across it, my question was,
well, this looks cool, but I don't know what it is.
And it's kind of hard to pin down
because it actually does a lot of lovely little things
really well that you might have to go to different places.
It's this little web Swiss Army Knife
that you keep adding utility to.
So for anyone who doesn't know what it is,
it's like, well, you need to do forwarding.
here we go, you want a webpage, do that.
So it's so nicely combined,
but you've now got this social element,
which I think is cool.
So there's the status log that was mentioned,
the web logs coming,
but then you've also got the IRC
and now this Mastodon support.
So just steering the conversation that way a bit,
what was your thinking with the Mastodon element
and taking on this responsibility of an instance?
- Well, the thinking,
there wasn't as much thought into it
as I thought you would have put into it.
- We've got to look at your messaging, Adam.
- Okay.
(laughing)
- Back to business.
- And you can speak to it pre a couple of days ago.
- Well, yeah, no, it's just brutal honesty
is what you get here.
But no, I started looking into Mastodon
about three months ago.
And at that point I was already
kind of just done with Twitter.
I never really did Twitter very well in the first place,
but I just felt less and less comfortable there.
And I know other people were as well.
There was a lot going on then,
nothing like what's going on now,
but there was still quite a bit bubbling around
in the Twitterverse back then.
And I was just like, okay, I'm finished with this.
But I wasn't quite finished with the idea
of having a space for nice people to kind of hang out
and chirp small messages at each other.
And I was familiar with Mastodon.
I had an account on, you know,
the original Mothership instance,
mastodon.social, played around with it a little bit,
and said, you know, I can give this a spin.
I'll try setting one of these things up.
And I did, and it was pretty easy.
I was like, hey, this is great.
Like, come on in, folks.
Let's just hang out here if anybody wants to.
So yeah, kind of put it up there,
it stable and open up the doors. And so it's, it's there for Omgulal members to, to join.
I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's fun. Episode. What was the, what was the episode 41
that where Jason coined that name? So Jason, you have the, the royalty checks for the naming rights
will be coming in the mail soon. I'm sure. I have so many checks that are supposedly in the
the mail from people. It's wild.
But but yeah, fast forward to
about a week ago and
the Fediverse
got a little bit disrupted.
There was a disturbance in the in
the force.
It's just things went crazy.
There was a small
exodus from Twitter.
I mean, fortunately, it was small.
I mean, it was tens of thousands of
people that not not to not to social
dot law, not to my thing, to be
clear, but just to the network of federated Macedon compatible activity pub instances
that are out there. And that activity has kind of put a drain, a real strain on the
whole federated network. And there's a bunch of us that were kind of like bailing water
out of our little instance boats and just trying to keep things afloat. And, you know,
My stuff went down, a bunch of other people's stuff went down.
We figured out how to make it come back up.
It's been exciting.
It's a huge learning opportunity to get into some of this stuff.
I didn't know the first thing about Rails applications
before this.
I didn't know the first thing about this other particular
database implementation that this uses.
And I still don't know much about it,
but I know more than I did.
I'd like to ask a question about running an instance like this
as well, because I think it's really interesting that you said
that you were kind of done with Twitter.
I think Jason, you're not on Twitter anymore.
Andrew is, I am.
- I think I left about five years ago.
- Yeah, okay.
So we all have differing experiences with it.
And some have experienced harm and others haven't,
but that's the way it is.
I suppose one of the biggest criticisms
that's leveled at any social network
is the idea of not just developing new features technically,
but moderating appropriately,
making sure that you're creating an area
that's safe and caring or welcoming for different people.
Now you've obviously left Twitter
because you're dissatisfied with where it's going
or where it is at the moment.
But what is it like to think about the fact
that you're now managing an instance
where you're maybe having to moderate people?
'Cause I know in our particular example,
we have a Discord for Hemispheric Views,
which we have a great kind of audience slash community there,
you're on it as well, Adam.
And we fortunately haven't had to deal
with any kind of horrible stuff there.
People are very, I don't want to say well-behaved,
but welcoming and tolerant, right?
Did you give much thought to,
or have you wrangled with the idea
that you might be seen as the kind of moderator
that people were critical of on Twitter,
albeit in a decentralized sense?
- Yeah, many, many thoughts have crossed my mind about this.
The moderation is important.
It's a responsibility.
It's not something that can be taken lightly.
And I did go into this with my eyes wide open.
There's a lot of stuff I'll happily admit,
like, oh, I didn't think about that.
But this one, I knew that at the end of the day,
there would have to be somebody responsible for this.
It would be me.
I would have to make decisions and take action
and put real work and effort
into keeping this community safe and healthy and vibrant.
And so yeah, my sleeves are kind of perpetually rolled up.
I'm ready to jump in and execute on that whenever needed.
In the past, this has been running
for nearly four months now.
The beginning was just a handful of people
that were poking around at it.
And it's just now starting to pick up a little bit.
But over this entire timeframe,
there have only been just a handful
of things that were reported.
were really easy to take care of and none of them had anything to do with our members.
They were reports that were made on content that was federated, things that people were
seeing on the federated timeline, which kind of pulls in things from the broader network
of Massadon instances.
And so there's simple actions you can take to sort of fix those kinds of things.
But yeah, no, knock on wood, hopefully kind of along the same lines as the Atmospheric
Fuse Discord, I'm hoping that our actual social.lol instance, you know, the local group of people
are well behaved and that folks can kind of go with the flow and follow the code of conduct
that we have. And I'm not honestly really anticipating any issues there, but ready to
deal with them if they arise.
I think you have one key benefit that I don't think a lot of other instances have.
And I kind of tie this as a connection towards something like micro.blog, where micro.blog is very much in that same vein of, "Generally, everything's fine. People are friendly." And so forth.
Because there is a paid entry fee to be there.
And social.lul is different than every other instance I've ever dealt with in the fact that you don't just simply, one does not just go to social.lul and say, "Hey, I'm going to be there."
that you don't just simply,
one does not just go to social.lol and sign up.
You must first be a member of omg.lol,
which then gets you entry into social.lol.
So it is a little bit of a twist
on your standard Mastodon instances.
And I don't have proof to this,
but I have to imagine that at least helps a little bit
with that moderation where somebody is not
more than likely going to pay
just to go somewhere to be an asshole,
like they're gonna be like,
well, there's all these free ones where I can do that,
so I'll probably go do it there instead.
So in a way, I feel like this paid entry is helpful
for the instance that is social.law.
- I agree, I think so.
And even before the Macedon stuff,
just the core Omgolol service itself
was one that I've been really lucky
with just overall the kinds of things
that people are putting out there.
People are building nice, fun pages.
They're building fun personal profile pages.
They're occasionally building cutesy other things.
And it's very rare that someone will put something up
that's like, "Ugh, that's really not great."
And I'm a thousand percent sure
that it's that small cover charge
that makes all the difference.
And it's a shame that it's like that,
but that's the world we live in.
- I have to imagine, obviously we gave you some crap
about the low, low price, but even at $5 a year,
that is enough of a hurdle to keep
a lot of that crap off of there.
So if you would have just been free out of the gate,
I can only imagine how much stuff you would have had to,
how much of your development time
would have gone towards moderation
actually getting to build new cool stuff.
And then when it actually picked up,
oh, by the way, all the good usernames are gone.
And then you're in that kind of mode as well.
So I think the $5 in all, you know, kidding aside,
really helped you get to here.
- Is it feature request corner yet?
(laughing)
- Oh boy.
And then his video turns off.
(laughing)
- Whoops.
- This is still within business consultation mode.
- Oh, absolutely, this is what I do for all my clients.
I think, have you ever considered?
And there may be actually a really good reason
why you have considered and discarded this stupid idea.
But have you ever thought about having a either,
a directory of all the websites running on there?
So you could, others could get inspiration kind of like,
or some kind of randomizer web ring approach
where rather than a directory,
It's just click this and get shot off to a random on Galil site.
Yeah, I have, I have thought of the first one.
The second one's a really cool idea.
I haven't thought of the second one.
So you, you get credit for that, Andrew.
All right.
Checks in the mail.
When we do that, you'll, you'll be getting your, your royalty checks as well.
Soon as I hire that accounts payable person, um, and the check printer, um,
we don't do checks.
We don't do checks in Australia, right?
It's just EFT.
Okay.
Just electronic funds transfer, direct deposit, please.
Wow. Do you want to give your bank details while we're here?
Just in case anybody else wants to send you a transfer.
14 days net.
I also want to introduce a new recurring segment where Andrew says business or
financial related initialisms and acronyms and then explains what they are.
That's, and now I have to put notes on this.
My browser history is a disaster because of the notes, but go ahead.
And Andrew is that is that no check thing like like actual for real like Australia policy, or is that just
Practically speaking nobody uses checks anymore the latter. I was curious
I didn't know if that was like a like an actual thing where like if you brought a check to a bank they'd laugh
They would do that. This is Australia. So yes, they would laugh at you
And I would also laugh at your spelling but that's we don't mean to look into the 1990s
Anyway, but no seriously on the on the feature front. Yeah
so that topic has come up come up a couple of times and I've sort of done an informal poll of
Like a small chunk of the membership
mostly in the form of
You know different chat things like before the IRC server
We hung out in slack and that was another service that I moved away from
Before I set up the IRC server and back in the slack days
I did ask folks about that and my key question was, "Hey, if we did something like this,
would you expect to want to opt into discovery? Or would you be okay with your thing just kind
of showing up on a list all of a sudden?" And the reactions were kind of mixed. There wasn't
a clear consensus. About half the folks were like, "Yeah, cool, whatever. My stuff's out there."
And the other half were like, no, I would be uncomfortable
if traffic was being driven to my page
with something like that,
and I didn't have an opportunity to opt into that.
So that's as far as I got with that feature,
was just kind of realizing like,
oh, I don't really know what to do with that.
But there probably will be an opt-in kind of approach
to that and some kind of directory or listing.
And then obviously once that's up and running,
like the I'm Feeling Lucky button
or whatever the equivalent would be for Omgulol,
I'm Feeling Lawlish, I don't know.
You'd be able to click on that and get to something.
Another thing I've wanted to do for a while
is just make my own list of my favorite pages
that I've seen people make.
There are some really great ones out there
and I haven't done a very good job of sharing them.
Some folks have done some truly creative stuff,
A lot of fun retro stuff, a lot of like web 1.0 stuff.
There's some real gems hiding out there
and I need to get like a really bright light
shining on them.
So I appreciate you bringing that up Andrew
'cause I need to like dust that off
and I'm not really like tracking that feature
anywhere right now, but I need to start doing that.
- I think opt-in would be a good way to do it
because it kind of reminds me of, you know,
the now page movement, just a way of discovering.
And yeah, if you just have a little tick box or check box,
that would take care of it.
- What's a now page movement?
- Derek Sievers.
- Yeah, so if you, it's just a way of kind of bridging
the gap or creating a little network of blogs
for people to discover each other.
And you just add a page to your blog that says now
and what you're doing at the moment, project wise
or leisurely in your life.
And if you submit it, you can then discover
what other people are up to now.
And then by extension stuff on their blog.
- Much like a status log on Omgulaw.
There you go.
Which is so good.
I love that thing.
I know the hardest thing is remembering to update it.
Right.
Yeah.
I'm guilty of that myself.
But yeah, somebody asked me the other day, like, hey, when am I going to be able to like
other people's statuses?
When am I going to be able to reply?
Oh boy, you're not.
Like, this is not a social feature at all.
It's deliberately not social.
It is a one way, like, here's what I'm doing, here's what I just ate for lunch.
And it just goes out into the ether.
And the best bit about that is you're using those emoji that Microsoft teased us with.
And they said that this is going to be the new look Microsoft emoji.
And then they gave us that hot garbage instead.
I don't know what you did.
Did you just steal them from their demo website or something?
But they look amazing.
It was, actually the status log was born like three days after Microsoft put all of those
fluent emoji assets on GitHub.
They put them out there, they open sourced them all and I was looking at them and I was
like, okay, these are so awesome.
These are a lot of fun, love these.
And then it just kind of intersected with that other like random thought on like what
be the most minimal sort of like totally minimal like I don't even want to call it blogging like
I you can't legitimately call it a blog but like one sentence one statement about you know what's
going on and uh and that's where status.lol was born and the uh the fluent emoji having just came
out it was it was like a match made in heaven it's like okay yeah this this is what's gonna go on
this. This is how this is going to look. And I really love it. I think it looks great.
So, because Microsoft is so huge, one of two things happened, right? Either some super
dumb non-event manager axed it for no reason kind of thing, and it was just killed, or there's some
wild story about what happened with that, right? Because I don't understand how something that
that looks so good got shoved aside
for what they ended up with.
Unless if I'm just don't know the story,
but it just seems wild that you'd go through
all of that design and iterations and they're all finished.
It's not as even like they're in like a half done state.
And then you go above and beyond
and then open source release them.
Like what, how does that happen?
Does anybody have any idea?
- I suspect that it was a timing issue.
I think they had to get something out.
They had to get something into Windows 10,
Windows 11 was coming out at the time.
They had to get rolling with something
and I don't think they were finished with,
I have no evidence to back this up,
just speculation on my part.
I just don't think they were actually finished
with all the assets.
And even now, the Fluent Emoji set that they put out there
is like Unicode 13.1 or something,
I can't remember the exact thing,
but it's behind a couple versions.
So there's certain emoji that you won't find in that set.
Ask me how I know.
I get the emails that are like,
how come I can't do the spinning head emoji
or the vanishing emoji?
- Do you know if people are actively contributing
back to this since it's in GitHub?
Like can people that can do art try to know?
- No, I think it's in GitHub specifically as like,
hey, come and get it world.
but they're not taking pull requests on new art.
They're sticking kind of to their thing, which is fine.
It's, you know, they can do whatever they want.
But I do get the sense that they're working on it.
I do think they're gonna be adding more assets.
I do think they're gonna get more stuff out there.
And yeah, Andrew, it seems like they are being selective
about how these things are rolling out.
So I don't know if you use Teams at all.
I do in my job.
- The nice like full 3D fluent emoji
and even the animated versions, which are really cool,
they have shown up in Teams.
So they are seeing the light of day
in the context of certain Microsoft apps.
They're just not like omnipresent in like Windows
as everybody thought they would be.
- It feels like a good competitive thing to do
to have that set be front and center
and let everyone use them for whatever.
So people start using those in their own projects
because I think everybody uses default Apple emoji
for everything, right?
If there's an emoji in something somebody creates,
it's an Apple emoji 'cause they tend to look the best.
But if you sort of put these out there as like,
hey everybody, use these for whatever,
it's almost like a kind of veiled way of saying,
hey, look at Microsoft stuff instead.
(laughs)
I feel like that might be a good approach for them.
(upbeat music)
Who wants to talk about Ferrite 3.0?
Fairlight 3.0, this is something that we discovered
on our favorite social network, Twitter.
So thank you.
For anyone who isn't aware of the app
or hasn't used it before, or heard our mentions of it,
Fairlight Recording Studio, not a sponsor,
just beloved app, is really the basis
for editing and production for this show.
It's made by Woojee Juice, great name, always loved it.
And essentially they're coming out with a new version.
And you're probably thinking,
well, why are you mentioning this?
Why does it help or mean anything to me?
Well, Jason is show notes master.
Andrew and I take turns alternating to edit the show
and Fairlight is the app
that makes hemispheric views possible.
Yes, we could use other applications.
There's GarageBand logic, there's Audacity, all these.
- Have you heard of Hindenburg?
- Oh my gosh.
- Yeah, Hindenburg was interesting.
I think Andrew hated me that week.
Anyway.
Sorry, Fairlight Recording Studio,
I just want to put a little shout out to it.
There's a new version that's coming out
with enhanced organizational tools
and goodness knows what other features.
We'll wait for them to announce more of that.
But I just want to give a shout out for this app
and just say how absolutely enjoyable it is to use,
how integral it's been to the Hemispheric Views experience
as a producer.
And I can tell you that in the other podcasts that I do
for my just solo projects,
uni, even for my paid employer, I use Ferret Recording Studio.
And I think, Andrew, you can add your own thoughts, obviously,
but it is such a pleasure to use because it, you know,
you can do it with an iPad and an Apple pencil.
I find that it's a kind of work away from work.
It's a hobbyist work.
It feels almost like you're being an artist
on this magical pane of glass moving audio around.
So yeah, it's kind of been a life-changing application
for me.
And if anyone out there is thinking
about starting a podcast or just editing spoken word audio,
even on a casual kind of quick basis,
it's worth that little investment.
And it's so exciting to see this kind of active development
and addition of features.
So shout out to Woojijuice for their wonderful work.
Very excited.
- Two questions.
First question for Martin.
Is this an application you use to edit
really specific stories at rsspod.net?
- Thanks for the plug.
Yes, it is.
- Oh, good to know.
And then second question for Andrew,
is this an application you find useful in editing the NBL Pocket
Podcast?
No.
[LAUGHTER]
That didn't work.
OK.
Well, you heard it here.
If you want to hear something edited by Ferrite,
you're going to want really specific stories and not NBL Pocket Podcast.
We fly by the seat of our pants on that podcast.
That thing is virtually live to tape.
I just want to say with Ferra, the one thing I'll say is that if I didn't have this app, I would feel like I wasted my money on an Apple pencil because it's the only thing I really use my pencil for.
But the sensation of, like Martin said, grabbing a waveform and kind of manipulating it with that pen, pencil, it's sublime.
compared to using it on a computer, like you've got a bigger screen on a computer and you've got that,
but you've got to memorize keyboard shortcuts and you feel like you're
distanced from the thing that you're trying to do. And if you don't remember the million
to people shortcuts, it just feels really inefficient. Whereas fair art, you feel like
you're making positive progress at all times. - You feel like an artist. I know that sounds
ridiculous, but it's like I'm directly manipulating something to make a product. It's wonderful.
I do have a question though.
Martin and Andrew, do you, you,
you both make this sound like so much.
I was just looking it up and I've never had to edit, um,
a podcast, but you kind of make me want to now, um, with,
with that description and I have an Apple pencil right here that I don't use.
Um, but, uh, I, I have to ask, like,
do you all fight over who gets to edit this show? I mean,
As much fun as it is.
To use this.
I run away as fast as possible.
Let me answer this.
Andrew you first this time.
Let me answer this in a roundabout way.
The idea in originally was let's do a three, you know, three people, three edits.
Jason, Jason went to Powers to Purchase because Jason's answer to everything is just throw money at it, right?
So Jason purchased what, Logic?
Was it Logic or the other one?
Yeah, Logic.
Yeah, Logic.
Yep.
Set down and edited one show and I think it took him oh gosh what.
6 hours.
It is time to use time to see my 6 hours that that's longer than what it takes me but it probably takes me still a couple hours at least and it feels sometimes it feels longer than that maybe it's 3 I don't know haven't done the stopwatch recently.
Three is the average. It takes a long time but yeah like Martin said it's kind of almost almost therapeutic and it doesn't feel like you're working.
Yes adjacent yeah I don't know if I answered your question I mainly just want to take the piss out of Jason for not contributing to the editing.
I think if he had a crack with ferrite I think it would be a different experience I think Jason went down the logic route I think he I think it was overwhelming too many too many buttons.
We've got such a good system running now though. I don't really want to.
Well, I don't want to do show notes.
So I think, you know, you don't want to mess with perfection, you know, you just don't.
But if you want to add a mate, if you want to have a crack at editing, we'll send you the files and.
First time we've had a guest edit the show, by the way, thanks for being here.
And here's the files on my desk.
By 5pm.
There's business.
Look, what I'd say is like any kind of work,
and you know this with OMG.lol, Adam,
it's a kind of passion that you have,
but it's probably exhausting, right?
And the same goes for this podcast.
We do it because we love it,
whether it's show notes from Jason
or editing from me and Andrew,
we put a lot of effort into it and it can be tiring.
And I can tell you that with a full-time job
and family and uni commitments and stuff,
it ends up happening late at night.
And if you look at some of the screenshots
in the Ferrite timeline,
things that we put in the show notes,
you will sometimes see something after midnight,
'cause that's just the way it goes.
And that's not a complaint,
it's just when you can put it and fit it into your day.
So what I'd say to anyone, whether it's you, Adam,
or someone listening who's thinking about doing a podcast,
the start that I had was actually using micro.blog
on my Feldnotes site with the podcast of the same name.
And the beauty of the micro.blog platform
is that it encourages you to do microcasts
if you use the Wavelength app within 20 minutes.
And that's a great thing to do
because if you keep it to a microcast length,
if you do something which is really just
throw it out there and make it quick,
editing will be more pleasurable.
It's gonna be a more fun, quicker experience.
Whereas what we're doing,
we try to keep things to an average of 45 minutes
unless we have a larger thing or with a guest,
but with that comes more work.
So what I'd say is give it a go,
But you don't have to shoot for the longest thing.
Quick is often best.
(upbeat music)
- What makes me laugh is Martin says,
"We do this show because of the passion
and it's something that drives us."
Speak for yourself, Martin.
You know what drives me?
- What drives you?
- One Prime Plus, baby.
(laughing)
That sweet Patreon cash.
- Andrew spells passion as C-A-S-H.
And I want to give a special shout out to new One Prime Plus member.
Oneprimeplus.com.
Mandaris.
Mandaris.
Mandaris.
Mandaris.
Mandaris.
That's tough.
Every time we have a new person, we've never actually heard them say their name.
So we always just sort of guess and then usually butcher it.
I know.
So thank you for your contribution to our cost pace.
And my future retirement, really.
You keep paying, I'll keep producing shows.
That's really what it comes down to.
Not with your current exchange rate.
Actually, that is a fair point.
It doesn't work better for, no, it's better for us.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Pay us US dollars.
We love it.
We love receiving those US dollars.
Don't like, don't like, don't like, like subscription services, like, you know,
omg lols that put their price up and it goes from a reasonable $8 Australian to a less reasonable
$7,492. True. Yeah. It's not all your fault. Currency fluctuations. I guess I would like to
end with one more thing if I could and I would like to say along that line if anyone is listening
and does not already have an omg lol or omg.lol as it is typed out and you want one write us
at hello@hemisphericviews.com.
And I will personally buy you one by the end of the year.
No, by the end of January, let's say that.
By the end of January, 2023, write us.
I will buy you an OMG.lol for one year to kick you off
and get you going down the path of happiness.
- Okay.
- Adam, anything you would like to toss in here
before we disconnect all of the cables between our homes?
- No, no, this was fun.
I really appreciate you having me back again.
No, it's wonderful.
I appreciate it.
- Awesome.
Thank you so much for joining us as always.
Every year, we do this every year.
It's a tradition now.
- Neat vember.
- Neat vember.
- It is a thing.
- So we will, should we do like a dentist appointment?
Should we just schedule him in now for like a year from now?
I was like, how about, yeah, October 4th?
How's that?
That's a year, I don't know, sure.
So it looks like it'll be around November.
- Are we doing the goodie bag that comes
with the toothbrush you don't need?
- Yeah, yeah, definitely.
- Yeah.
- And the toothpaste, that's the flavor
that is no good at all.
- In a tiny travel pack, it's like,
that's not the flavor I'm used to.
- No. - What are you doing?
- Now I'm gonna travel, it's gonna be weird.
It's already weird, now it's really weird.
November 9th or 10th is probably when that'll be, Adam.
So if you wanna go ahead, do you need the little magnet
with the little tooth magnet?
We could write that on there.
I'll send that down to you. Don't worry. It's on its way.
Also, do you have your private health insurance card with you?
At all times? This Martin, this is the U S we buy it.
We have to have it on us.
I forgot that in Australia. It's like, Oh, I left it at home.
That's right. It's on the doc web now in Australia.
You could just grab it from there. That's true.
If we don't carry ours, they'll leave us dying in a ditch.
Exactly. That's, that's literally the law. Yeah.
That's a great slogan for the whole country. That's great.
Well, I know that's staying in now because that came from the South.
Adam, thank you so much.
Once again, OMG.lol for all of your needs today and tomorrow.
Andrew, Martin, anything else from you?
There is one little thing I want.
Yeah. You'll have to humor me here.
I want us on three.
As always.
On three as a crew.
I want us all.
He's going to make us sing again.
No, I'm not going to make you sing.
I'm not doing singing this time, but I want us to all give a good, like, like in a basketball huddle.
3, 2, 1.
And then I want us to all say Omgalol at the same time.
Do we have to do the hand thing too?
Or?
You got to do the hand thing.
Do you have to do the hand thing?
Yeah.
Okay.
Ready?
And then is it 3, 2, 1.
Martin, could you just screenshot the hands, Martin?
You're way ahead of me.
I was doing that.
I'm still waiting on rules.
I can't see your hand.
Is it 3, 2, 1, go?
Three, two, one.
Three, two, one.
And then omgulol.
Three, two, one.
Three, two, one.
Okay.
So then like, do you start it?
Cause you're like the coach or something?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm, yeah, I'm going to count you in.
Don't worry.
You don't even have a clipboard.
How would I know?
I think it's down.
I'm losing blood here.
I'm losing blood.
Holding this hand up.
Okay.
Southern hemisphere, go up.
Northern hemisphere, you can go down.
Okay.
Three, two, one.
Omgirl!
Oh, see you did it wrong.
I thought it was gonna be 3, 2, 1, then go.
Can we do this again?
Yeah, we have to.
You did it wrong.
Come on.
Hands in.
Come on, team.
I thought you were like the media at the games.
Don't you know?
Hands visible, everyone.
Jason, raise your hand.
I'm here.
I got two hands.
You only need one.
Put the other one down.
Don't confuse it.
OK, 3, 2, 1.
Omgirl!
OMG.LMGirl!
Omgirl!
Gosh. Nailed it. Good job everybody.
Man.
All right, I got some ridiculous screenshots.
Get out there and score some points.
Well, Adam, I hope your sales pitch goes better than that little effort.
Gosh, thank you.
All right, now I'm going to count us down to stop recording.
All right.
That's the next key piece of information.
Oh yeah, you'll get this count right, don't doubt about that.
This is my count.
- Cheers. - All right. (laughs)
Three, two, one, stop.
