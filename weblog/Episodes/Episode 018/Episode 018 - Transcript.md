Oh, my own personal curiosity, finder views.
I would like to talk about this.
Sure there's going to be some pretty extensive thoughts on that and I'm just going to go
ahead and say that I'm in the minority here on how I have my finder set up and it generally
angers everyone.
Kind of like how people always have the dock in the wrong place, right?
Where it's supposed to be on the bottom centered not hidden.
Yeah.
crazy things. Sure, Jason. I do Finder questionably. Maybe I should let you guys go first and then
I'll horrify you at the end. Okay. Martin, you go first. And what I'm looking for here,
kind of just an overview of, you know, when you open a new Finder window, a couple of
things. A, if you just open a new Finder window, what is it open to immediate, like right away?
B, how big is it? Is it kind of like big enough to where everything on the sidebar shows and
takes up most of the screen?
Are you like a little tiny find your, find your window person?
And then just the third one, feel free to go with more, but do you view it as
icons, list columns or gallery?
Rest in peace.
Cover flow.
Yeah.
And then maybe anything else interesting about, or are you like a total weirdo
and you're like, I just use pathfinder or something.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
I have no idea if I'm gonna be completely controversial or completely boring, but I'll find out very shortly
So when I open up the finder window, it greets me first of all with iCloud Drive
That's what pops up and that's the destination for all of my documents because I choose to sync the documents and desktop with iCloud Drive
So yeah, don't know if that's boring or not, but that's what happens as far as the layout is concerned
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, wait, I forgot another thing when you want a new finder window
How do you do that? Do you command n?
Do you double click on the hard drive icon if you have that showing that's another one. Go ahead
Okay. Well, I'll answer that straight away since it's a it's been brought up. I click on the finder icon in the dock, but typically
Jason's gonna
I don't know why that that obviously seems like the most logical place to do that
And I don't think I've ever done that in my entire life
Well, that's the thing and this came up recently when we were talking about our desk setups
Which I've changed naturally since the new Mac came and everything, you know when we did our own battle stations HV mini episodes
I grew up in the period when you know
You would have your Macintosh hard drive or HD on the desktop and I would normally do it that way
But when things changed from classic Mac OS to Mac OS 10 and the dock was prioritized
I started to get rid of the hard drive on the desktop and switch to clicking on the finder icon
That's normally what I do. Generally, I keep a finder window open
sometimes I use tabs
but generally it's going to be clicking on the finder icon and maybe
Intermittently doing the command tab switcher or a gesture to bring it up
But I try not to open too many finder windows. I find that messy. Does that answer you?
Yeah that I'm still a little bit hung up on the clicking of the finder icon
honestly
And not in a bad way, it just feels like for some reason my brain has trimmed the dock there for so long.
I don't even see that that's the first icon. It's like that's icon zero and it just for some reason my brain program doesn't show zero.
It starts at one for some reason and zero is a hidden file.
It's a dot file.
I love the fact that the dock is bookended by two permanent icons, the trash, or the
bin as we call it in Australia now, the bin and the finder icon.
And I've always loved that icon, I know it's changed over time but, you know, it's a smiley
face, it's friendly, who doesn't love it?
So I'm happy to click on it, it's appealing.
As far as the layout of the window's concerned, it's large enough that yes, you can see all
of the sidebar items.
You'll be very pleased to know that in the favourites area I list everything alphabetically,
AirDrop at the top and I reinstate the folders Movies, Music and Pictures which for some reason
Apple thinks they should be hidden. I don't know why because they're actually pretty useful places
to save things. Under that I do have some quick items to certain folders that I use. I do have
one stack in the dock but there are certain things like even the shared folder to this show which
appears under there. I do keep the toolbar thing at the top with icons only not with text. I did
tried the whole Syracuse-style thing of getting rid of everything and living the minimalist
lifestyle but I found the friction and battling the system to be too difficult in stripping
the stuff so I keep the default layout pretty much. I do change some of the buttons up the
top. Otherwise I open everything in list view with the drop down arrows. I used to be a
column guy but it started to annoy me a bit when I couldn't see full titles and had to
adjust columns. Icons was more of a launcher thing in the 90s, I don't really like doing
that anymore and gallery and cover flow stuff is just impractical.
Awesome, yes, okay, perfect.
Thank you.
And do you have any question mark missing plugin thingies on your top of your finder
window?
No.
No.
Okay.
No.
If such a thing were to happen, they would be eliminated immediately.
And Andrew, you're up.
I probably need to preface this by saying I actually hate the finder.
Really?
Really it sucks Wow why it never does what I want it or work the way I want it to I feel like a stranger
In a strange land when I'm using it. It's always just fighting me a little bit. It's friction when I use it
So I don't love it. It's an
Unpredictable mistress like you never know what you're gonna get. I'll click something
I'm like, I was just gonna come up at a window. Is it gonna give me a tab or is it gonna be in column view?
I can't I really don't know and if I change it
Will it ever come back that way or whatever it decides to do is just what it does
So I don't have any fixation with it really because I know there's no point because it's gonna go wrong having said that
All right, so that's my preface
So I will prefer to use launch bar whenever I can I'll navigate my hierarchy with launch bar all the time
Million times a day rather than using finder
however
If I do want to bring myself up a finder window, I clicked a little smiley face like 99% of the time
It's kind of how you get things going to my mind is the finder icon like three times as big in Australia as it is
In the United States and that's why I'm just it's blending in
He's just so happy. Look at him
He just gets happier every time you click him to be fair the biggest way I would get in through launch bar
I would find my folder and then push enter it'll pop up but you know from scratch
I will occasionally click the hard drive icon to bring it up and I just did that
So I did it I click the finder window and this is case in point, right?
I click the smiling finder and he does the right thing
He brings it up in column view the way that should be the way that is most useful
So I like him because he does that and he brought me into documents iCloud Drive documents
All right, then I decided okay. Let's just I'll click the hard drive icon
Hard drive icon brings me into hard drive which kind of makes sense if you think about it
But it's in like what's the what's the view with the disclosure arrows, so it's not column view
It's another view like why why isn't it the same? Why do they work differently? I don't get it
So that's that what else is I gonna say sidebar llama size of my window
It's like a quarter of my screen by default if I want to bring up a new window
And this is another thing I always with finder
It's like I'm never remember if it's command n or shift command in and I always get the wrong one
So do I want to create a new folder or do I want to invoke a new window?
And I have a hard time remembering that I think for a while
I even swapped them in keyboard maestro to try and help me out. I don't know what's going on anymore
I think that's another Syracuse and thing actually he's brought that up. It used to be the other way around right sick Mac, right?
See and this is a problem with for a long time. I was Windows guy as well
So you kind of have these vestiges of windows hanging around in your head as well, which is a bit awkward
Sidebar like you Martin. I have my music movies and pictures back
I have a few works sidebar thinking be above us to get me to quick folder locations
What else do you need to know?
I have a question because it's actually something that I forgot to bring up and I want to know if you do the same thing
I reinstate the status bar and add the path bar. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you need both of those you need information
Yeah, thank goodness. We can still be friends
I had noticed you mentioned you had it in icon only view in the toolbar at the top
Yes, mine were set to icon and text
I think I don't know if that was just happened as part of a big sir thing or if I just
Changed it one day and didn't realize but I've fixed that now. So thank you. It's icon only
It's all I need to see who brought me a bit of space back on my monitor
You should try moving your dock to the side because you get just like so much more space. I do I do that's where it lives
So as I was saying find out it sucks Jason. Yes. Over to you
Well, this is
Pricing myself here - - - - out of three people click the finder icon to get a new finder window
That is amazing. I I genuinely want to know I need to put up a poll or something somewhere
Do you use the finder at hemispheric V on Twitter? Yes, because I actually want to know now this this was a part of this conversation
I never expected to happen again because
anyway, so
New finder window and to bring up a point about what you just said Andrew that it doesn't work consistently all the time
The issue seems to be with when you try to open a window by clicking on the hard drive icon
if you just do like command and to get a new window and
You do your little show view options save them and do all that stuff to get it the way you like it
It works every time
Totally fine, but if you click the hard drive icon, it just does whatever the hell it wants to do in terms of setup. So
You're not wrong there. I totally agree with that point. Okay that being said
The window must be no shorter than the length of what is in the sidebar
There should never be scrolling on the sidebar files are fine
Obviously that can go forever but sidebar no scroll ever don't do it. No arguments. Yep
Yeah, I'm happy with that it pops up as a new window into iCloud Drive because I also use that as my main
Storage area which coincidentally I think that is why
movies music and
Whatever the hell is gone
Because I think it's a maybe you should be putting your stuff on iCloud Drive kind of message versus keeping it on your local
Computer like all those Final Cut Pro exports that I do which will instantly appear in the cloud when I 100% sounds convenient
Yep, happens to me with logic all the time.
Like, is it there yet?
Nope, okay, there it is.
Favorites are in somewhat disarray.
Not thrilled with the way that's going right now.
A couple different things in there
that I hit a lot of times.
I'm more of a do a symbolic link to a folder
on the top left part of my desktop
because I have a very wide monitor.
So it's kind of like a quick access
to projects I'm working on currently kind of person.
Icons on the desktop, eh?
- Yeah.
- You don't use stacks in the dock?
- Yeah, and it builds a little fan,
it fans out when you click on it.
- I, yeah, I have two of those.
I have one for downloads and I have one for applications.
'Cause I like the way when you drag applications in there,
you get this nice like fan of all the icons right there
instead of having to dig through the applications folder.
Even though 99 times out of a hundred, I use Alfred,
But still sometimes there's that, I know what I want and I know exactly what the heck it
looks like.
And for some reason, my brain just won't tell me what the damn application is called.
But as soon as I click applications in the dock and it gives me the big picture, I'm
like, oh yeah, that one.
I don't know.
Maybe that's just a me thing.
Sorry, I've got to get this off my chest.
Like you can't do anything with those fan things.
Like I've got one here for downloads and you can't right click on them.
Like you can't do anything.
So you're constantly looking at it and then like,
oh yeah, I wanna do something with that.
So open in Finder and you open a window.
Oh look, that's opened in ListView.
Why not ColumnView?
Stupid.
- Well, I love the doc stack.
I hate that they gave the same name to the desktop thing,
but anyway, naming, that's a controversial thing.
But the fact that you can do a list
and then just hover through all of these different folders
super quickly, I like that.
But yeah, I agree with you.
The fan is a bit, why is it curvy?
I don't know why it's jutting out like a palm tree.
- Oh, I don't use the stack view, I use the folder view.
- Yeah, okay, no, that's fine.
- And then view contents as automatic.
- Yeah, that's what I've got too.
You still can't do anything with them though.
- Just quick access.
- Yeah, the application one is more of a launcher,
I guess, than anything.
- So you have your whole applications folder doing that?
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.
- Again, if I could actually remember
what that damn thing is called,
it's much faster to just use a launch bar or an Alfred,
but for some reason, there's always, I'm like,
"Oh, I just want to do the thing."
And then I'm thinking like, if it's like Transmit,
I'm like, "Oh, I need the truck.
What is the truck app called?"
And if I just bring that up, I see a truck
and I click it and I'm off and running.
- But surely like Siri's natural language processing
is so good, you could just say, "Open the truck icon,"
and it would just know exactly what you're talking about.
- See, and I don't know this for a fact,
but I think either it's learning or I'm not sure what,
but I think in Alfred, if I type truck
And then go and select transmit.
I'm pretty sure it learns that when you type truck, it knows
what the heck you're looking for.
Or if you type like, you know, transmit T R and then arrow down.
Cause you have a couple that start with TR.
I think it eventually figures out like every time he types TR nine times out
of 10, he wants transmit, so I'm going to do that, or when he types
broom, it brings up Hazel.
So
That's how my brain works sometimes.
Is I'm just like, what is that thing called?
What's that thing with the, it's the foxtail app.
Oh yeah.
Foxtrot or, you know, whatever.
It's just, I don't know.
Sometimes it's a faster way for me to figure out what's what.
So back to your finder window.
Yes.
What's troubling.
So I am an icon view person.
Why?
And I think I'm the only one in the world, potentially, other than people
that don't know you can change it.
What appeals to you?
- I like to see where I'm at right now
and be able to see the thumbnails of things.
And maybe this is back to my looking at icons visually
versus what the words are.
But when I bring up the icon view,
I know exactly what's going on.
I know what's an image, I know what's a PDF,
I know what's a document.
It just makes more sense to me.
I don't know, but nobody does it that way.
Everybody does the list view or,
It seems like three column is like the most popular,
but I am an icon guy.
- Can I ask you about the icon view?
When you work with desktop icons or icons in the finder,
are all the icons snapped to grid
or do you have things arranged in interesting,
almost like skeuomorphic paper-like
post-it notes upon a desk?
- Well, if I could share my screen with you right now,
that would tell you everything you need to know.
The desktop is the only one that is not, well, they're all snap to grid.
That's a given.
You can't have icons not be aligned.
That's just madness.
Oh, yes.
So everything is snap to grid, but the desktop is the only one where you're allowed to move
them all over.
Everything else is alphabetical, snap to grid, folders on top, which is kind of a recent
change.
with that yet, but we'll see where that goes.
And tags have to be showing in the sidebar as well.
- Oh.
- Oh, tag.
You use tags.
- I do, yeah.
All of our files are named or tagged for the show,
and they're automatically tagged with Hazel.
So every time something's dropped in there, tagged.
I use it mostly because I have a big giant archive drive
slash media drive that's like 50 billion terabytes.
And having tags, doing it consistently for the last, however many years helps
with the archive side in terms of just being able to go back and find stuff a
little bit more quickly because I'll have like a bunch of work files that are
archived, but I know they're all work.
So anything that's tagged work, don't even bother looking at that.
Cause I know it's not going to be in there, but yeah, finder tags.
I quite like them.
I wish they were maybe a little easier to use.
I think that's why people don't use them because they're kind of a pain in the ass.
Much like how I have to use Hazel to basically auto tag stuff a lot of the time because it's
just such an extra chore to do.
Do you group by anything?
You know how you can group them by kind or date?
No, only by folders first, then all files by alpha.
And I do have a question mark in my top area.
I guess when I updated to Big Sur something went away.
I don't know what it was.
It won't tell me.
Is it being removed or is it staying?
I kind of like it now.
I think I'm going to leave it.
Don't do it.
Yeah.
Why?
Because I like when I click the arrow.
It just says waiting dot dot dot.
But I know nothing's ever going to happen.
So I could wait forever.
Or maybe I could wait a minute, five minutes.
We don't know.
We'll just kind of let it sit there and see what it does.
I don't understand why this is something that stays.
I didn't know it was there until quite literally three minutes ago.
You must have more interesting files than I do,
because when I look at things by icon,
first of all I need to make them gigantic to even start to figure out what they
are. So they're massive, massive icons,
but then most of them realistically are just kind of like boring work
documents that all kind of look the same.
So I don't see the benefit of that.
You know what I'm fascinated about? People,
There must be people out there who use the list view for example
But want the big icon experience of what Jason's talking about even if they seemingly have boring ones like you say you do Andrew
So they make the icon size bigger so they have super thick pinstripe alternating color in the list. You know, I'm talking about yeah
It's horrendous. That's how they have to be those people out there and then you just have like this huge eye gap to read every
Single file title every single file name. They're out there. I know you're gonna have them hugging you can have them close
I knew I was gonna be wrong slash right about the icon view because I I've never met anyone that actually
Thought that I was doing it correctly in terms of the view
How big are your icons like on that little slider where they sit?
64 show view options
That's tiny
64 by 64 that's tiny. I've just zoomed mine up to
144 by 144 and I can still hardly figure out what they are goodness
If they were that big I think I would have to go a different route.
You definitely have more interesting files than I'm working with.
Talking about the size of things and how things are presented in the finder, when it comes
to the gallery and the cover flow thing, I know cover flow is a thing of the past, but
this gallery view, do you reckon, I just have this inkling that maybe marketing people asked
for such a thing?
Because I don't see how it can be useful other than flicking through photos, but then there's
quick look, so why would you bother?
Do you think it's just something that they want to promote,
even if no one really uses it? It's like, surely someone will like it.
If you're looking through like 40,000 comps for a
design or something, maybe,
but even still like it's not that fast.
It would be faster to just blow up all the icons to real big and then go through
the whole folder. I don't know what this view is for. I,
I've never used it.
It is interesting that it allows you to do like the plugins with it where you can,
like, if it's an image, you can quickly rotate it or do markup or whatever.
But yeah, it just seems like such an extra process to be in this weird view.
I can't imagine a lot of people use that view.
It just doesn't seem, it seems very specific.
Like you had a very specific need and there are enough people in the world
that are having that specific need where they're like, all right, leave it in
there because you know all of Marcom at Apple uses this like every day so we
need to like you know keep it in there well I'd like to hear from people I
don't know about YouTube but if you do anything weird in the finder let us know
at hemispheric V on Twitter hemispheric views on micro blog send us an email
I'd like to know what weird stuff people do in the finder maybe it's that gutter
review could be anything. I think we need another poll that has four options of
icons, list, columns, or gallery. Yeah. It's probably gonna be 0% icons, 98% list,
1% columns. No, maybe closer 50/50 on columns and lists and then 0 on gallery.
I just can't imagine. Columns is the one true, right?
