Hi, I'm Andrew and I'm Jason and I'm Martin this is hemispheric views
Do you guys mind if I smash this box of shapes while we record what's that pizza go for it old mate
Pizza and barbecue. Hmm old mate. Love it
That's a positive thing, right?
When someone calls you that, is that correct?
Is it Andrew?
What do you reckon?
Old mate?
No, I don't think so.
I texted him that once and I actually felt the anger come back through the text.
That doesn't usually happen.
And I was joking, obviously, but he was very offended.
Old mate is a terminology that's used over here.
I enjoy it a lot.
I love it when somebody says, "Old mate over there."
Just dragging the can.
Old mate is usually when you don't know somebody's name legitimately.
And usually they're probably there one or two steps removed from you.
So you don't know them directly, but you might see them across the road or see
them have some interaction with them that isn't direct.
And you think they're a bit of a tool or they're doing something dumb.
Do they have to be older than you or like significantly older than you?
Or is the old not in relation to their age?
I think it was going to be more relaxed but that I think you used to be there were generally an older type but nowadays I think I think people have picked up on the phrasing so don't think that matters so much anymore,
ok but they just like this and all my so I'm trying to think of a good example,
look at old mate over there trying to fill up his car and he's put in on the wrong side of the petrol station is pulling the,
Bowels all the way over the other side of the car.
And it's stretching and whacking and not quite working.
Getting angry with it.
Good on you, old mate.
Old mate of his.
Really smart.
I had a great example recently.
I was, I won't name names, but I was out for lunch with a friend and they were having a conversation with someone else and they weren't really happy with what was being said to them.
And then when we left afterwards, he turned to me and said, I was this close to headbutting old mate Martin.
So there you go.
I love everything about that.
I want you to see that become a phraseology that turns up in Portland just suddenly everything all night.
I could start that I'm game for that so something like I was at Whole Foods and all my tried to sell me salted pistachios is unsalted pistachios this place ahead but no this close to head button like just mere moments away.
Old mate try to tell me the pizza shapes when a thing.
I'm pretty good I got save still eating them so you need to get on to the cheddar as well cheddar shapes I need the chicken ones those are the ones I'm most interested in next chicken crimping yeah the crimpy,
this is special they've actually got their own they're not chicken shapes there chicken crimpies yeah they actually they still branded under the shapes but they have their own subculture.
Yeah, it's like they are under the umbrella of a shape, but they have a further
Defined shape of the crimpy and they're a bigger chip. Oh, that's well, that's interesting
Well, the pizza the barbecue ones are smaller than the pizza ones
so although the shape is
Arguably the same I think they could have differentiated the shape a little bit more there
So if you're going in blind to like a mixed bag or something, you could know what you were getting never makes your shapes
I always mix my shapes.
You need to know what you're going in for.
So you don't want to you probably don't want to see this abomination I have next to me.
Nobody wants a surprise shape.
Everybody wants a surprise shape.
You need to know you need you go in with a plan so you're like I want right now I want a chicken crimpy.
I don't want to be rummaging around in the hope that I might get a chicken crimpy plus flavour contamination.
I want to I want to challenge this surprise issue that you have Andrew.
Right. So, let's say you're watching PlaySchool as a kid.
They've said, which window are we going through today?
Oh, I love the window game.
That element of surprise.
You don't want to know, oh, they're going through the square window or the arch window,
because then you've taken away all that anticipation for where they're going.
Yeah, but did you ever see how angry I would get if I didn't, if the window I chose, the square window was not the window of the day?
Was square your favourite?
Yes.
I loved the arch.
What did you have against the arch?
It didn't know what it wanted to be.
It was half a square, half a circle.
It's it has identity issues a square is clear the square is angular. It's precise
90-degree given how businessy Andrew is is it any surprise you choose the square it makes sense
I don't know. It seems pretty ironically perfect. I just just say messy. Ah, she's a messy arch is interesting
It's it's very how many shapes were there was there just two three. What was the third one a circle?
Which is arguably the most harmonious a square a circle and an arch you would have thought it would have been triangle maybe for the third one maybe I'll maybe there was a triangle window now and I wasn't.
I have to do some research and put that in the notes I was too distracted by Bonita by what.
Is that one of the people on the show yeah yeah if I if four year olds can have crushes I had a crush.
And then this is a real person or these were like puppet character.
She was a hot she was a real person she was a host.
They would play school was real quick to real people and a piano a pianist off off screen you never saw the pianist but they played live piano and some stuff toys.
Not not puppets stuff toys.
Stuff toys.
Dolls.
I have a breaking news element here. I've just looked up online.
Oh my.
PlaySchool windows and there's an article from the Australian site Mamma Mia, with which I'm familiar.
We're huge supporters of them, by the way, if they'd like to place an ad.
There you go. Well, there's an article here that is called, was PlaySchool's arch window your favorite read on?
And then it has little definitions that say which window defines you as a character or whatever.
Oh, wow.
Oh, right. Okay.
Wow.
So I'm just taking over a bit here, but it says that, let's have a look.
Does it say what all the choices were? So people can play at home?
Yeah, so there was the square window, the round window, which was the circular one that Andrew
just said, and the arch window. So in order, they define who you are as a person if you like square,
round, and then arch. So I'll read the first paragraph. So the square window,
you're an organized, logical, and hardworking person who likes structure and rules. But
But sometimes you have trouble making decisions because you always want more information.
Wow.
Like, could just shut it down.
Totally nailed me at four years old.
I'm reading his Twitter bio and that's literally what it says, word for word.
So we've revealed a lot about Andrew through his PlaySchool preferences.
We're going to move to round now.
OK.
I'll take round since you took the other one.
I'll just take it right now.
Yeah.
Yep.
The non-tessellating option.
Cool.
Let's see if we agree with this characterization.
So the round window.
Jason.
people person with lots of sympathy and consideration for others. You listen and communicate well
and are very perceptive about feelings. You like harmony and hate making unpopular decisions.
A circle is the glue that holds the team or the family together.
Oh man, look at that. I mean that just, I don't think there could be a more perfect
definition of me. I like how you're saying this as you talk
through pizza shapes, it's great. It really is like a kid watching Play School,
isn't it? It's got his snack plate.
All right, here we go. The arch window. Oh, God, here comes the arch with the foot window.
Who knew who knew windows could be foot shaped?
Apparently, they can. The arch shape symbolizes leadership. The main ability of the arch is to
focus on goals and deeply and quickly analyze situations. An arch is a very confident person
who wants to be right in everything. Archers find it difficult to admit their mistakes are easy to
train and absorb information like a sponge. Their career gives their life meaning. Negative
qualities, excessive self-absorption.
Holy actual F. Those three descriptions, like, this was beyond unplanned and could not have
been more incredibly perfect.
Wow. That is amazing.
You are such an arch. Oh my gosh.
I promise listeners this was not planned I just looked this up.
Oh this is not at the top this isn't even in the run sheet this topic.
I didn't even know this existed until today so that's gold.
So everyone watch PlaySchool that's the message choose your window.
Is that still going?
Um yes it is.
It is okay.
It's beloved.
I grew up on that show.
Is that like a public access TV kind of thing like a like a Sesame Street situation like we have here or is that similar-ish?
Martin this is your domain take it away.
Mr. Rogers.
Oh, sure. After our media chat in the Discord, of course. Yeah, it's run on the ABC. That's the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It's been going for years. And yeah, so that's
taxpayer funded or subsidized public TV.
Like our PBS. Yep. Would be the equivalent.
That would be the equivalent.
Yeah. Okay.
So, there you go. And I'm sure you can find them in those clips. I always enjoyed John,
Noni, Jemima, George. They were-
Yeah.
I think Jemima was actually a doll.
Jemima was the doll.
Yeah, but that's all right.
Jemima's part of the crew.
Don't worry.
It's like Big Ted.
That's right.
I mean, I think it was a Monica Trapaga.
She was a great one.
Oh yeah.
That was probably a little bit after my time.
Yeah.
She was good.
But yeah.
Oh gosh.
Give me warm fuzzies.
Big Ted, little Ted, Humpty, they're all in there.
That is Memory Lane Corner for you.
Discord Corner.
Discorner.
We need a theme tune.
So Alex, who's sometimes in our Discord, may want to just whip up a quick Discord corner
theme.
But Jason, I'm going to turn to you today and just ask you if you could just give us
a quick Discord corner theme tune.
Just quickly, Alex, for those who don't know, is Andy's brother.
Just so if anybody's curious about that.
Discord corner theme is...
Oh, on the spot.
It's the corner of all corners.
We love to chat.
It's called Dis Corner.
Love it.
No?
Is that not good enough?
Oh, okay.
I thought you had more.
Oh, no.
I was expecting sort of a musical interlude or something.
What's the best corner?
Dis Corner.
Don't diss me in the Dis Corner.
No, I'm not the one to go to for all things song related.
All right.
Sorry.
Should I just go to the topic then?
I would say probably just skip directly to that before people delete the episode.
Part of my morning routine these days is to open the Discord in the morning and then see how excited and active the US contingent got while I was sleeping.
Yep.
And it was pretty busy today.
But one of the topics that came up was the issue of tabs.
Tab management in the browser.
And people talking about how they have too many tabs, overwhelming numbers of tabs.
And then there was conversations about tab groups.
Do you split your tabs into windows and groups and things like that?
And it kept me thinking, I feel like there's two very different type of people in the world.
There's the tabaholic who's just, just tabbing the world away.
And then there's people like me who maybe have four or five tabs, but that whole time they've got anxiety about having that many, those many tabs.
And they're just trying to close them ASAP and get back to a single window.
Those are the squares.
So I was just kind of wondering whether you guys have views on this.
Are you particularly wedded to a way of tab management?
Are you okay with the pinned tabs or does that give you anxiety as well?
Just wondering where you are on tab management to round out the discord.
No.
Yeah.
I have some hemispheric views on this.
I do like the tab groups, that new thing that hits Safari.
I have one for work, one for, well, you have like the main one
where it's kind of like your throwaway tabs
where they don't really have a name,
which is just general day to day.
And then I have a dedicated work group for work stuff.
Then I have one for this show.
And I think those are the only,
yeah, those are the only three I have.
But I do find them to be very handy
because it puts me in a different context
as I'm going back and forth.
So if I keep like a micro.blog in the other one
and then I switch to my work one, it's not in there.
So it's a nice kind of separation
and I can effectively in my brain say,
okay, I'm in work mode now,
so I'm gonna work on these things.
And then now I'm in,
or if I was like, I can't do work things right now,
I need to like, I need a brain break,
I can switch to a different tab group.
And then for the show,
it just has all the stuff that we need
for doing the post show,
like the fireside stuff and all the stats
and all that other crap.
And then as far as the regular throwaway tab group,
it varies, usually it's around three to four.
It could get upwards of 10 if I'm trying to find something
or purchase something that has a chip in it
during the chip shortage.
But yeah, I don't really have a,
the only thing that annoys me is that I found out recently
is that if you have video playing in one tab group
and you have it picture in picture,
If you go to switch tab groups, you can't.
It's like, nope, your videos,
you can't have this video anymore
if you switch tab groups, which is weird.
And also just how fast they get shoved out of memory,
which, okay, that's fine, I guess.
But when you reload a tab group,
it's like kind of starting from scratch a little bit.
You have to reload each of the tabs.
They don't all reload at once until you click on them.
But I think that's my tab view.
I don't know if that really answered anything
that you asked, but that's how I use tabs.
- Well, it does remind me about tab groups,
which I had entirely forgotten about.
- Yeah, I don't think it's for everyone.
I can see why people would be like kind of absolutely
or just no, it doesn't feel like the kind of feature
where you're in the middle at all of like,
oh, I sort of use it sometimes.
I think you're either tab groups or no tab groups.
I don't really think there's a middle ground there
just 'cause I don't really see how there could be.
- Yeah, I tried tab groups.
I felt like I was sort of always in the wrong group
at any one time.
I think I'm too, I didn't stay in a zone for long enough.
- Yeah, I would like better accessibility
in terms of shortcuts, not shortcuts, the stupid things,
the short, just like keyboard shortcuts or whatever,
to be able to move between them,
because I was hoping that I could put on like a button
on the stream deck too,
'cause I have different stream deck pages
for those same similar kinds of things.
So it'd be nice to have a button associated with that area
that would pull that tab group up.
but that does not currently exist.
And if there is a way to do it with shortcuts, I don't care.
- Martin.
- Yeah, the whole tab situation.
My experience really closely mirrors Jason's.
I like the tab groups
and I've since adopted the whole work thing
and then a podcast group.
I actually also have a restaurants group
and that comes down to the fact
that we would constantly order dinner
from similar restaurants and I'd go,
their website's rubbish or what's it called again?
I'd have to search for it, I didn't have it bookmarked,
and now I just know they're all just in there,
and I can launch this browser equivalent folder
of all of the restaurants that I like.
The funny thing though is that I've always been
like you, Andrew, in the sense that I don't like
a lot of tabs open.
It's messy and seems kind of counterproductive.
You just can't find things as easily.
So I started to use the tab groups
and really liked how you could sort them out.
But the irony is that I've actually been less diligent
in controlling the number of tabs that I have open
by using groups because while groups keep things split up
and organized in a sense, you forget potentially
how many are open in any given group
or the unnamed default one.
So you end up, in my case anyway, it looks organized,
but I go, where is it?
It's just spilled out or there's too many.
So I have way more tabs open than I ever did before
because you can technically hide them.
- Yeah, that actually makes, reminds me one other thing.
Maybe everybody knows this already,
but if you do use tab groups, if you right click on a tab,
you can send them between different tab groups as well.
- I love that.
- So if you do open something in your kind of throwaway tab,
you're like, oh, this would be great for,
or perfect example of what I generally do.
If I'm in that like throwaway group
and then something pops into my head,
oh, I need to look up this thing
for let's say a work-related thing.
I'll look it up and find it
and then just right click send to my work group.
So then I can kind of keep that
for when I go back to that tab group
and not have to be remembering which group it was in.
So you can move them around pretty easily.
And people had a go at Safari, you know, last year when they were doing all that redesign stuff,
but contrary to whatever I was saying, the tab group behavior is actually pretty well thought
out. And I like that idea that when you open up a link, it does throw it into a new window or a
separate section to keep it away from all of that stuff that you've organized. And then you have
that option to go, no, bring it back into the fold or put it here. And that is Discorner.
Now Andrew you wrote a piece recently which was very interesting on your micro blog site is that right.
I did I had some had some fine fine feedback from from some readers of mine listen very stimulating commentary.
Yeah.
Martin.
Oh just me.
No there was others as well.
Oh thank goodness I thought it was like oh no did I badge you or something.
No you didn't at all.
Yeah it did you have a preamble that you wanted to.
Say about post know I was doing the Segway so you could talk about it. I want to hear from you.
It does it nicely to square windows on play school actually because I've been.
More aware recently of well recently over the last.
Set a year 7 years 6 years something like that of autism.
Because it has become more widely known in society
But I've been directly affected of with it because of my son who was diagnosed with autism when he was in
Preschool so over the few years
He's been going through all sorts of therapies and they're ongoing to help him out and to help him get through life basically and become a
Person that can function effectively in the world that we have created
That's generally more suited for people who don't have autism
Over that time and learning so much about it. It gives you pause for thought because not only are you dealing with your own kid?
But you're naturally
sent back to your own
upbringing and the life the child you were and the things that you did and
you're listening to the story you'd been taught coping mechanisms and
Being able to teach David how to how to manage his own life
and you start to think a lot of this sounds familiar to what my own childhood was like and
You start to think do I also have autism?
and
Came up again because I was really I read a post the other day by Hannah
Gad post an article an extract from her book who's an Australian
Comedian and she became quite famous through her Netflix stand-up show
What was it called Martin?
Nanette. Thank you. Yeah, and she she in that show came out about her own
Autism diagnosis which she got as an adult. Anyway, so this article was going on was talking about her experience in life and
Reflecting back on her childhood. I was like, wow, that's so so many elements of that resonated with me
And I think back to what I was like as a kid and even what I'm like now and I think I
reckon if you did a
DSM
measure on me
You would probably get me ticking the enough boxes to be a person with autism. What is a DSM?
It's like a measuring thing. So they talk about I
Can't remember what it stands for now. It's a diagnostic test you take. Yeah, it's like a diagnostic
Measures of stands for diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders there we go and so you have everything from
schizophrenia on this DSM scale
Through you know autism all other sorts of different mental illnesses. I think if that was if I bothered to go down that path
I'd probably tick enough boxes if I'd bothered if I'd had access to that pathway as a child I would
Absolutely have ticked all the boxes and I think over time I have learnt my own
coping mechanisms that work
75% of the time and I think sometimes I'm become so that's become so much part of me that I mask myself
And I don't realize that I'm masking but yes
So and that's why it was interesting reading this Hannah Gadsby article was about how much this masking just becomes second nature
And it was just an interesting thing. It's like well we as a society have come a long way
when I was a kid, autism was unheard of.
Well, I mean, it just wasn't,
it was never considered an option.
Nobody thought about it.
But I think about my behavior.
So when I was a kid, I was terrible.
I hate, I got in so much trouble constantly.
I would scream and carry on and beyond that
of just a normal kid,
real behavior management issues when I was young.
And then I look at my interests and I think,
I had really deep interests in computers and
You know
I didn't have a lot of friends and I had a real hard time making friends and there's just all these little signposts along the
Way as I think back
Okay, and now the Apple maybe doesn't fall far from the tree and I see my son
Doing things and behaving ways and it's like looking into a a time machine mirror
And I'm just like oh, yeah. Wow. I know what you're feeling right now mate because I've been there I've lived that
It's just a really interesting kind of thing.
So I put a blog post about it to reflect on that.
- When I read it, the thing that leapt out to me
when you said it would have been handy or beneficial
to have this diagnosis or at least some sort of guidance
given your theory that you had or have it,
I was really interested in the sense
that you hear a lot of people say these days,
and this isn't just for conditions
or whatever it could be identity-wise,
the idea that labels are unhelpful
or that we shouldn't label things.
But in what you're saying,
you're saying that a definition or a label
actually would have given you a sense of confidence
or confirmation or help or something.
And then that whole point that you just said about autism
being something that wasn't really known of
or understood or named,
it's still kind of difficult to define today.
Someone who's on this part of the spectrum
is perhaps totally different in their confidence or ability
or issues from someone else on the spectrum.
So is the label the thing that you think
would have been most helpful?
I know we're kind of speculating here
or it's more of a personal reflection,
but what do you think?
- Yeah, I know it's difficult.
And that's the thing with autism is it is such a spectrum.
And if I was on a spectrum, if I am on a spectrum,
it would be on the higher functioning end.
- Sure.
- Probably the end that used to be called Asperger's,
which isn't really a terminology in use anymore.
Yeah, so I think it would have been helpful
because I felt so different and isolated
and it would have been helpful to know,
now this is just a way that some people are
and it's not you failing or being weird.
It's just you being a different kind of person
to the majority.
And there's plenty of other people out there
in these, having the same experience,
but there was no way for you to be brought together
or to be made aware of that.
And even more so pre-internet and all that,
you're living in your own little islands.
So it just would have been reassuring, I think.
- I even feel uncomfortable using words like condition
or issue or something, 'cause it kind of implies this sense
that it's removed from the, in inverted commas, normal,
when there are things that people
on the autism spectrum can do
that I could not even have a hope to do,
Or the three of us would go, wow, how do you even perceive or do that?
So it's very hard to talk about.
It blows me away. And it's one of those things that I remember.
One of my things I went to almost become, I thought I might have talked to you guys about this before, almost became a
flight air traffic controller.
I just went, I saw a job ad one day and I was like, oh, give that a go.
I don't recall this.
No.
Oh, OK. Maybe I've never told you guys about this.
No, never have you said, oh, air traffic control.
I'll give that a go.
Yeah, I was bored with my job I had at the time.
And so I went to this air traffic control thing and it was one of those things that you go through.
First you do it an aptitude test and then you do a putting the shapes in the proper squares test.
And then you come back.
Perfect for you.
You come back.
Notice how he said proper squares, not put the shapes in the proper place, put the shapes in the proper squares.
That's how it works.
All the other shapes he left on the desk.
And then only the squares went in.
I was brought back weeks later and it was like Severance style.
You were brought into a room and there was a whole range of computer terminals and you
basically had to play an air traffic control game and stop multiple aircraft from crashing
into each other and that kind of thing on these old graphics terminals.
And all these, and they were eliminating at each cut, they were cutting people.
And I remember at that terminal day when we were playing the games, I was talking to some
And I'm like, yeah, this is like my fourth- they do an annual intake and this is my fourth effort at getting this.
And I keep failing at this point. How many times have you done it? And I'm like, first time.
I'm not even supposed to be here. I just showed up.
And they were all like massive airplane guys. They were kind of like, you know, they knew everything about an airplane.
I'm like, has two wings. I don't really know anything about airplanes.
You were just really good at geometry and like recognizing right angles and stuff.
And to the point where they offered me a job.
Wow.
And I turned it down because they were going to send me to Outback Queensland on less money than I was earning at the time.
Wow.
And I was like, thanks, but no thanks.
And they said to me, they said, we didn't expect you would take it, but we wanted you to know that you have the aptitude for it.
So, there you go.
That's great.
And I think back now, like, probably that was an autistic trait.
You know what I mean?
like you don't see it in the moment but how else do you end up being good at
flight traffic controlling when you have zero interest in it I don't know it's
can I generalize for a minute sure I'm editing so I'll help if need be I think
anyone of the age roughly 30 to 50 today has some form of this feeling maybe not
related specifically to autism, but related to something, whether that be a diagnosis of
whatever, or I think Martin said earlier, some kind of identity thing. Because back when this,
I guess this is maybe one gen or two generations, however many generations that covers,
that idea of the, the idea of this quote "normal" was so razor thin, there was no latitude to be
off dead center without there being very, well varying degrees, but generally pretty terrible
repercussions to not being on that razor thin line. And only now, which is still the very early
days of acceptance of most things in the world that should be accepted, are we starting to
broaden out that line of... and I'm using normal not in the sense that it's the right
way to be, just in maybe the middle of being accepted.
That razor-thin line is widening slowly, but it is.
So I think that is, I think, a place where a lot of people in that age range, especially
now when you're in 30 to 50 having children, having these traits now become more generational
to you.
Because I think looking backwards doesn't really help because it was only worse and
worse in terms of the awareness of certain things, right?
So you can't really look at your parents and say, "Oh, yeah, they..."
Because it was even more removed from their world than it was from ours.
You talked about, Andrew, where the word autism
never really happened in your worldview.
It happened somewhere, but not generally enough
for it to hit your doorstep.
But now, it has, which now makes you look backwards.
You have to imagine your parents before you,
it was even further pushed back in the mindset of anybody.
So I think that is something in this particular time,
I think it's probably, maybe it's a little wider than that,
but I feel like people that are around 30 to around 50 right now are very much
in that looking backward and thinking a lot of these quote new concepts,
which sure we can call it that.
Maybe that was me,
but there's no way to go back and really do anything about it other than just
kind of speculate that,
Oh,
now that we know about this new thing that does sort of fit the mental model of
what I felt like I was back then.
And I do the same thing all the time where,
you know, pick a thing if it's,
I'm not even gonna pick anything.
I don't wanna like call any one specific thing out,
but there are definitely traits and things
that I know about today that I sure as hell
did not know about when I was seven years old.
I knew about, you know, dumb kid stuff
when I was seven years old.
I didn't know about any of this stuff.
But now there's a lot of times where I'm like,
holy hell, boy, if that doesn't fit the,
or as you said, tick all the boxes.
And again, there's not shit I can do about it
other than the fact that I had to find
and manufacture ways to cope with things
to avoid falling outside of that center line
and becoming quote, the weird one,
or like the, you know, generally you'd fall into like,
oh, you're the nerd because you just sit at home
and play computer games all day or whatever.
But I find a lot of similarities into what you're saying.
And I think a lot of people in that age range, I guess, is the long and short of what I'm trying to say.
I think that's more and more common right now in that group.
Yeah.
I guess all I want is it would be fun.
Fun.
I don't know if that's the right word, but it'd be good to have an opportunity to go back, know this, and just have a do over on some of the things that happened with this knowledge.
I'd be like, "Oh, if only I could just go back and change that or do this thing differently."
Yeah.
You have to imagine though, too, though,
that the support around that wouldn't have been there.
So it really wouldn't have mattered.
Even if you knew that, oh, autism is a thing,
and I quote, am experiencing that,
like no one else would have cared,
no one would have been there to support you in that.
So it might actually have been worth,
like the ignorant, it may have been bliss
to just not know to some degree,
because there would have been nobody there to go to
to help with any of that.
because nobody knew how to deal with it.
So in a way it's almost, I hate to say it,
but the fact that you can cope with that stuff
and figure out ways to progress,
I don't know if that's maybe the better way to go,
but I just don't think you would have had anyone there
to really help or listen or do anything about it
to help you in that, unfortunately.
- I have a question, continuing on from what Jason was saying,
you know, reflecting and what you can and can't do about it.
I don't want to tell you how to feel.
And I know that we had a conversation about this
on micro.blog, Andrew.
I mean, I would think that despite that lack of guidance,
you know, you said that you've built up certain mechanisms
or behaviours or things to adjust to different situations.
And naturally you've learnt and grown
according to your own experiences
when you're with your son.
And I don't expect any personal answers here,
but are there any particular things that you've learnt
after his diagnosis that you thought,
oh, that's fascinating,
or you've changed your behavior as a result,
or it's enlightened you in a certain way?
- I don't know if this is the best answer,
but it's the one that pops into my mind.
It's accepting the fact that things can be overwhelming
and that it's actually okay to step away from it
and to just check out and be like,
no, this is too much, I can't deal with this.
I need time out.
And whether that's me telling David to do that for himself
or whether that's me realizing that,
hey, I could do that for myself,
either of those are fine.
Whereas until I'd sort of had,
worked through this with him,
I've sort of been like,
well, you're in this circumstance, this situation,
you cannot leave.
You are locked into this.
It's a conversation, it's a party, it's an event.
You've got to be there because you showed up
and you've committed, you've got to stay there.
And it may be sending your brain insane
to be in that environment at that time.
And you may internally just be like,
you feel like you're getting claws ripped into your insides
and just tearing them apart from the inside,
but you've got to stay there.
And it's like, well, actually, no, you don't.
Just leave.
Even if it's, you can leave for three minutes and come back.
And that might be all it needs.
And that's fine.
you may check out and be like, I'm ghosting this thing.
And do that, 'cause you gotta look after yourself.
There's no point staying in a circumstance
that makes you uncomfortable, and then by extension,
makes everybody else around you uncomfortable.
- Right, I think that's what I was thinking too.
And in the past, if you had just left,
that would have been a huge deal.
Oh my, can you believe that he did that?
How rude or whatever.
Whereas now that there's understanding
around certain things, it's like,
yeah, all right, he left.
- Yeah.
- So you, okay.
Like, oh no, the world didn't end.
Like, it's fine.
He needed to do what he needed to do
and he's gone now, that's okay.
- Yeah.
- That's a great answer,
because I think in society there's generally this idea
that you see it through,
or if you, in inverted commas, give up,
you're a bit of a loser or something.
It's like, well, no, not everything's suited to everyone.
as long as you step aside politely or do what suits you in a way that's courteous, that's
totally fine.
Yeah, if you stand me up for coffee, old mate's getting headbutted, but...
Exactly.
You know, if you need to leave a little early, that's okay.
Look, coffee is fine.
I have no issue with coffee.
It's when it becomes a huge alcohol-driven event, then it becomes more difficult, just
as an interesting aside.
But coffee, I'm there every time.
- It's like weights all around.
(laughs)
- Thanks for sharing this Andrew,
'cause it is a very personal thing.
And I think it's important that for anyone who's listening,
we're certainly not suggesting, I know you're not,
it's not about, you know, go diagnose yourself or whatever.
It's more about be aware of your feelings
or what you're thinking.
And if you need support, you should go and talk to people.
- Yes. - Or find the resources online.
- This is not a health,
I'm not a credentialed health professional.
- Seek your own advice.
- He's only an air traffic controller.
- Yeah, that's right.
QF14 is safe.
- If you need your plane landed, give him a call.
- Jason, you've added to the notes,
I love my work, do you really?
- I do, yeah, this feels weird to talk about,
so I'm not gonna like really dwell on it too much,
but I'm not even gonna say where the place is.
I'm just going to say generally
that the reason that I wanted to even bring this up
is because of how incredibly different and weird
it has been transitioning to this new company
and all in an absolutely positive way
where I keep telling people I feel like I've built up
a career of mental scarring from working at various places
And I think that's just the nature of work in general.
There's just a lot of it is not super positive.
You know, I wasn't like physically harmed or anything,
but just, I think everybody knows what I'm talking about,
where you're just, you're working and you're like,
yeah, I don't not like it,
but I'm not like looking forward to Monday that much.
You know?
Like, it's just, it's a job, and that's fine.
But this process of leaving this old company, which was, that was like a whole
kind of weird thing in itself.
Maybe, maybe I'll touch on that later, but I don't know if the
statute's over on that.
I might get sued.
I don't know.
But transitioning over and doing like the, the interviewing, which was great.
I couldn't even imagine the interviewing like this existed in the sense that I
always knew what was coming next.
Everybody was fully in communication with me
throughout the whole process.
Everything was super transparent.
There was like a frigging blog post that was written
about what the whole process was,
so you could even see what all of the stages were
and what was expected of you.
And then doing interviews,
it was just like people were very open
to how much the company was a good fit for me,
which is weird, right?
'Cause when you're interviewing,
you're in this like weird blinders mode
of all I care about is getting this job,
regardless of what the job is,
'cause you're in job seeking mode, right?
Like you're just, your only thing is like,
I must get job, get job now.
That's like the only, you go like super basic.
And there's all these red flags along the way,
but you totally just push them out of the way
'cause you're like, this is the job.
This is the only job I'm ever gonna get.
That's how I am anyway.
I just get into this tunnel vision of like,
this is the only thing.
And none of it was like that.
And I'm gonna just say long story short,
at the end of it, it felt like I was surprised
at how much I'm going on and on about this process
and how great it is, where this should just be like the bar.
This should be the minimum
of this human interaction that's happening.
Yet these very seemingly basic things
of letting people know what to expect,
being punctual about communication,
like these very basic human interactions
don't exist in almost every job out there
that I've ever dealt with from a,
and I'm speaking from a tech background
slash healthcare background,
but I have to imagine you can probably generalize that
pretty much across the board,
that everyone's probably applied to at least one job
and never heard a damn thing back,
even if they reached out to you first
and were like, "Hey, we think you'd be a good fit."
And you're like, "Okay, yeah, let's go for it."
And then crickets, you're like, "Okay, well, that was weird."
And I feel like I'm preaching now
and it feels very strange, so I apologize.
But it's been like very restorative
in just a work mental capacity and personal
because now it's this, there's work-life balance,
which everybody talks about, which is like a dumb saying
that people always talk about, but it actually--
- You work at Lumen, right?
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.
So I sever and I go to work,
and then I unsever and come back,
but it does actually just feel healthier.
And I've never been able to say
that my job has contributed to my health.
I would say every job I've ever had
has been to the detriment of my health,
whether that was because I worked too damn much
or the stress level was through the roof.
Some of that just being the kind of person I am
that I will stress about everything
until the very last second and then afterward as well.
But it's always been generally a net negative until now.
So this story, I guess, is to do nothing for anyone listening
because I can't just say,
"Hey, go get a job that does this for you."
But I guess maybe it's just a little bit of a glimmer of hope
that apparently there are actually companies
built up of other human beings that actually want to
respect you and treat you like a human being,
which is weird and I've never been able to say that.
And it just, I don't know if I'm ever gonna shut up about it,
but here's where we are.
- I think you're being a bit self-deprecating there.
I think you have shared a pretty...
- No, you are.
- Oh yeah, sorry, I am.
Yeah, absolutely.
Sorry, mate.
I think there's a genuinely useful message there
for people in the sense that,
we're a tech adjacent podcast.
So, we're talking about a work kind of issue here,
but what you're saying is the technology
has afforded a different way of working,
or you can find a way that's healthier for yourself.
So what you would encourage people
actually look for a job that suits their own life, really?
I think so. Yeah. It's so hard to say because jobs are so difficult. You can't just go get a new one.
Like, that's not really a thing you can do. If you're talking about a phone, let's say,
a piece of technology, and it's not working for you, you can say, well, if you have the means,
go get this other one because this would suit you better. That obviously doesn't really work
for jobs.
But I guess the only thing I could say is if you are
looking to move positions and have the ability to apply to
different places to really try to,
and I'm putting this on everybody,
I'm assuming they do the same thing where once you're in
like apply mode, you're like locked in.
I don't know if that is the case for either of you,
but I have to imagine a lot of people are like,
once you apply, you're just, you're in that thing of like, I gotta get this,
I gotta get this without really thinking about any of the other consequences.
And I would say, ask questions during these interviews.
It's almost looked at as a negative where they're supposed to just ask you all
the questions and you're supposed to just sit there and shut up and take it.
And then whatever questions you have don't matter, but they really do.
And I think there's a lot that can be said for the types of questions you ask.
I saw a question just the other day, somebody said,
ask the company the last time
there was employee input on something,
and how was that handled by the company?
Because I have to imagine that's gonna throw
a lot of people for a loop.
They're gonna be like, "Uh, never,
"and we threw it in the trash 'cause we don't care."
- Yeah.
- But if you frame it, I suppose,
if you frame it positively as, you know,
people wanna show initiative,
or there's, you know, employee input into a situation,
it doesn't have to be a negative framing.
- No, no, it doesn't.
I just I don't think that that particular thing is something that a lot of companies even think about like receiving feedback is
It's top-down situation in most cases. So
Yeah, I I don't know. It's again
I don't think this really helps anybody but I I feel great about it
And I think it's amazing that that this actually can happen
What I think is great is that you found this circumstance that is obviously working for you and making you happy
the sad thing about it is that
It's such a rarity yeah so why is this so hard and in my line of work I see many many businesses I don't work for them all but I see them and the circumstance that you're describing I could probably count on one hand the number of companies I feel.
Meet those same sort of criteria yeah maybe delivering in a certain a different way but.
Is an environment where everybody is really bought in feels interested feels a part of the team is treated with respect there are not many companies out there like that and that is like.
It's a shocking reflection on our societies northern and southern.
That that's so hard to find because it should be based on that should be like this is the baseline level.
Right, exactly. And I think that's that maybe that's the takeaway is that my kind of enthusiasm about this is almost like a direct reflection
On the anger that I have that this is not just how it is
I feel like when I tell people about the various things and processes of this place
There shouldn't be shock. It should just be like why are you telling me something that everybody knows already?
And just to clarify for people in your position you have the ability to be a hundred percent remote
That's what we're talking about. It is. If it wasn't, I don't think it would be any
different other than that. I would go to a place, but yeah, just that every interaction
throughout the process was, how is this so great? Why have I never seen this before?
And how is this not how all businesses conduct themselves?
Can I hit you with one last thing in the main episode? And that is our sponsor this week.
Yeah. Oh, that's okay with both of you. Yeah, it's time to dynamically insert our ad. Let's do it.
Dynamically inserted ad. Our ad this week comes to us in the form of a poem.
Oh, yeah. They thought it would be fun to do a little poem for us. So I thought,
we're open to that. So here we go. This week's dynamically inserted ad. Now.

It's in the long game.
Beep boop boop, beep boop.
End dynamically inserted ad.
When you started doing that, I thought, "He's quoting something online. No, this is spam that
he's received. Like someone's actually sent junk mail to him in a poem to try to seduce him into
a service and then that service you spammed us with our own membership.
Yes, yes, sign up today one prime plus dot com or one.
Oh wait, no, we don't have that one.
Never mind.
If you go to hemispheric views dot au or hemispheric views dot us, you will find

I'd like to thank our other sponsor Netscape for this episode.
Oh yeah, Netscape, big supporter.
Navigator.
I think that was our first sponsor.
Yeah.
Yeah, Navigator was amazing.
Navigator 6 has just launched.
It has color now, I think, in version 6.
I think you can view--
- Animated GIFs?
- Yep, animated GIFs.
You can view color images in 4-bit color.
- I remember using Netscape Navigator
at the university labs, the computer labs,
and the splash screen would stay on the screen
as you loaded it for a good 30 seconds,
and you would listen to the hard drives going,
(imitates hard drive)
Yep. Yep.
Martin, you don't know. You don't know the joy.
It was like three megabyte hard drive.
Yeah.
No, no. Look, I was a kid and I reckon at that time that
Uppercase N with the shooting star going around, it was the pinnacle of computing.
It really was. Yeah.
It was.
That's what happened.
Bye bye.
