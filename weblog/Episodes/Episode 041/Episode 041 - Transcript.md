Beach balls.
No beach balls?
Yay, no beach balls.
Excellent.
Oh, Intel, you're winning Apple back already.
No, they're not.
- Okay, I have to just say something real quick.
You guys are cool doing like a two to three
to four hour show today, correct?
Is that?
- I assumed it was five, but okay.
- 'Cause I, unlike last time, or no, two times ago,
remember in the show notes when every single thing
had a basketball next to it?
- Yeah, that was a good show.
- This time, yeah, I mean the best shows usually
are the ones that have basketballs in there.
This time it's basically all me, which is concerning.
So also because I'm not editing, so who knows how this is going to go.
But I want to start out first of all with probably the most important thing that has happened
this year, decade, probably ever in the history of human recorded history,
and that was the live show of Crocodile Dundee Part 1 Live Watch.
It was pretty amazing.
It worked.
I gotta just say it worked. It worked well from what I could tell. Uh,
no one rage quit anytime during it, which was awesome.
And, uh, yeah, I just,
I thought it was a great way to actually watch a movie with a bunch of random
people across the internet. I, I don't know what else I can really say.
Other than that, what did you guys have any other takeaways?
I thought our audience was immensely polite and I'm thankful for that.
And maybe they didn't leave because they realized that we wouldn't have an
audience and we just be speaking to ourselves which would just be like any other podcast
but no it was great fun um thank you to everyone who joined us i think what i find most amusing
and maybe slightly worrying jason is that you keep saying part one like we should be doing the other
two very soon which given the uh quality of the movie is a bit concerning because i don't think
it increases from this point on but yeah great show and the only other thing i'll say is there
there was a contest. I love me a contest. Everyone knows that. So the contest was
how many times was the word "crocodile" said during the movie? Had to be singular.
"Crocodile" could not be a shortened "croc." Nothing like that. The winner is Gabs.
The total count was actually only 11. There were a couple in there that were
Crocodiles. So, it would have been like 13, 14, but no. Official count, 11. End of story. Gabs
wins. He gets the prize. What's the prize? Can't tell you yet, because I don't know.
But I think at this point, it's good to introduce a special guest who I think Andrew is welcoming
onto the show. Someone who actually is here despite the fact that we did that live watch,
and he joined us. Andrew, would you like to kick this off?
Yes, thank you. It's a special guest by a roundabout way through...
I always talk about Perth being a small place.
You're only one degree of separation from anybody else.
Well, we've since proven that the internet is a small place
and maybe you're one or two degrees separate from anybody else.
Because I heard about our special guest through his service.
His service, I'm going to steal his thunder a little bit,
it's called omg.lol, which is fantastic.
I heard about it through a microblog, through a user called Mike.
Who was giving away a year subscription to?
OMG dot lol I liked it so much that I didn't bother with his competition
I just bought myself an account and then through that discovered their discord server and then got talking to Adam
and like it just sort of seemed like a
Natural kind of fit for the things that we appreciate and like on the internet to then have a guy
Who's running a service an indie service to talk about what he does on the internet?
This was all before he sort of knew who I was I sort of just barged into his discord and said hey
How you doing Andrew's known to do that. He's this guy. I took the Martin Feld approach to life, you know, I just started
randomly
conversing with people
Adam took it with good grace and he joined us here on the show today. I'd like to welcome from OMG
LOL. It is Adam neat Nick, Adam.
Thanks for joining us.
Thanks for having me. I really appreciate it. This is awesome.
I have to ask a question right out of the gate. Uh, obviously, OMG.
LOL. How do you say that in practice when you're talking to someone,
do you say OMG. LOL, or do you say, I'm galol, or what do you say?
I actually say it. OMG. LOL,
which is really unfortunate because it's, it's like seven syllables.
It's a mouthful.
It's not really fun to say out loud.
It's fun to type.
I mean, it's a pretty short domain as domains go, but yeah, it's a mouthful
when you're saying it out loud.
So I try not to.
Did you, when you first saw that TLD come online in terms of being able to
purchase it, was that the first one you bought or did, did you just buy that
thinking, I don't know what the heck this is, but I'm going to do something
with it just because why would I not have this?
That is exactly what happened.
Yeah, so I was kind of goofing around and up late one night,
as I tend to do, start getting on the different domain registrars
and poking around and seeing what's available.
And I'm one of these people that likes to find a good domain name
and then build something around it.
And I've bought so many domains and built so many kind of stupid things
and then crumpled it up and trashed it over the years.
That's just sort of a pattern.
But this one's sticking.
This one's not getting crumpled up.
So yeah, I just I found the domain. I thought this is amazing. How is this thing even available? I snatched it up
And my first thought was I can make a really awesome email address out of this like a really funny silly
goofy email address that I can use personally or professionally I guess if I want to be daring and
So that's what I that's what I thought I'd do with it
And and then I realized that it's kind of selfish like I'm like
this is a really cool domain and to keep it all to myself is kind of ridiculous.
Like why not make it so that other people can get a slice of it?
And that's when I decided to just kind of dust off some, uh,
programming skills that I hadn't put to use in a while. They were kind of going,
uh, going stale and dormant and said, you know,
I'm just going to try to build a little service around it. And that's what I did.
Buying domains is such a weird thing with all these new, like when new kind of,
I guess, vanity TLDs I'll call it come online.
they're hard to get.
You want to get something short and meaningful.
And then there's sometimes a weird bidding process
or some kind of ticketing system.
When the LOL TLD came online,
were you there right away
or did you just show up two weeks later
and you're like, "Oh, all right, I guess this is available.
I'll just take it"?
No, I think the TLD itself, like .lol,
It's by Uniregistry, which is one of the big names
that goes out and spends the hundreds of thousands of dollars
with ICANN to get the permission to create a new TLD.
I think they came out with .lol five or so,
five or six years ago, actually.
It's been around for a while.
And I snatched up this particular domain
about two and a half years ago.
So it was just sitting out there.
It was just ready for somebody to do something with it,
just kind of unnoticed.
- I can't imagine a better use for it really.
So for the people that haven't discovered omg.lol,
can you kind of explain what it is?
- I can try.
It's actually hard to explain because, I mean, frankly,
like the way I describe it changes almost like month
to month as I kind of think about what I'm trying to do
with it and what I'm trying to emphasize.
It's got a fluid value proposition.
we'll put it that way if we're going to use some like businessy terms.
That sounds like business speak. I like it.
For listeners who can't see Andrew's eyes just lit up big time.
We can do a cost benefit analysis and talk about our KPIs and OKRs.
Oh, I just died.
No, I'm kidding. But no, what it is, I mean, first and foremost,
it's a fun domain name.
And so one of the first things I did was rig up a way for people to do stuff with DNS.
So anybody who's familiar with DNS knows it's kind of painful
and challenging and just really needlessly complex.
But anyway, so full DNS settings,
if you hop on this thing,
you can point your little slice of the subdomain
that you get, x.omg.lol.
You can point that anywhere, take it with you, do anything,
use it however you'd like.
So first and foremost, you can almost think of it
as its own little TLD of sorts.
I wanted to use it for email,
so I created a way for people to get email.
It just set up a simple mail server and forward email,
so it's got an email forwarding service.
I wanted to run a little sort of goofy profile page on there
so I built a way to host profile pages.
And I've got a few other things
that I'm kind of tinkering with.
- Well, the thing that got me as a customer,
I just thought the idea of a landing page,
that's what really won it over for me
because I've tried a couple of the landing pages before,
like bio.link, naming your competitors perhaps, I'm sorry.
And Linktree is kind of like the big one in the industry.
I think I probably have like five or six of them out there
by these days, I lose track of them, but they're always-
- Do they link to each other, Andrew?
- Of course, yeah.
- Good, all right.
- Like you don't have to be smart
be able to use this thing because I've managed to do it. So canyon.omg.lol if you want to get a sense
of what a person can do with it. Really it's just sending people to all my different properties on
the web. Influencer. I think probably other people will make you more of it in terms of tricking it
out but you don't need to do that. Totally accessible for anybody who just wants their
own little page on the internet that isn't their Facebook about page.
Ew, gross. Don't ever say that. I'm sorry. I hate to say it though.
He did mention x.omg.lol. Sorry, that's taken.
That's not available to anyone. So I do have, I mean,
I think it's pretty safe to say that as a podcast,
we're known for the hard hitting questions, right? You know, when,
when you think of tough interview type scenarios,
you think this show generally. So I'm going to ask just one very blunt, in-your-face question.
Why do you charge such an obscene amount of money for this service? I just don't, I don't,
the gall that you have to charge $5 per year, not per month, per year, $5. Okay. I just
I want everybody to realize that that's $5 per year
is what this costs.
So I went to register them and I was like,
oh, it's only $5.
Like it could have a bunch of these things
and it's totally fine.
And I'm thinking in my head, $5 a month,
'cause generally everything is per month.
No, no, no, $5 per year.
Like how could you not just get it?
Even if you do nothing with it, who cares?
Like just grab one, you'll figure something out.
It doesn't make any sense how you're getting all the stuff.
He mentioned like five things at least that this does.
And yet any one of those alone would be worth like five bucks a month just to be
able to have that as a service, but it's $5 a year. So there you go.
So where's the question?
Um, shame on you. It should cost more.
I actually, I wouldn't mind talking about the price actually, cause it, you know,
it's something that I've sort of grappled with in a way it's, it's, you know,
just being like completely honest and transparent.
I mean, I'm not really building this for the money,
which is great because I would only be disappointed
if I was, I've learned that pretty quickly.
But I mean, I'm just really doing it for the fun of it.
But I do get a lot of people that tell me,
like, you really should be charging more,
you really should be doing more.
And in my mind, it's fundamentally a domain name,
a subdomain of a domain name.
It's like how much could that possibly be worth?
I mean, you can buy a dot com for, you know,
10 bucks a year or whatever.
So, subdomain on a silly TLD or a silly domain name,
it's not even a TLD officially,
five bucks a year seems like the right amount.
So I just kind of picked that out of thin air
and went with it.
But yeah, it is really interesting
'cause I do get a lot of feedback from folks
that are like, why, you know,
you really should be charging more.
And I'm always torn because yeah, I mean, I like money.
Everybody likes money.
But, you know, I don't feel like it's worth that much more, to be honest.
It's, I mean, it's kind of me just doing my own thing.
It's not like I'm promising people, you know, amazing round-the-clock support
or that, you know, I can promise a beautiful bug-free experience.
It is pretty bug-free and it's really stable and everything's going pretty well there.
But I feel like the price kind of reflects the super casual indie nature of the whole thing.
Just carrying on the NBA portion of the podcast, I noticed going on one step...
I'm sorry, wait, hold on. When did we have an NBA portion?
Not NBA, MBA, M, Masters of Business Administration.
Oh, okay. I thought you were trying to transition this back to basketball somehow.
And I was like, "Wait a minute, hold on. I got to put a
No foul, technical foul, free throw.
- The MBA, so the business thing.
Not only do you charge a ridiculously low amount of money
for this service, you've gone one step further
and you actually publish your finances openly online.
I don't know how much of a,
I don't know if I should be mentioning this
or whether you would rather me not.
- It's not a new idea.
I've seen other companies that have done it in the past
And I've personally found it interesting
and I found it really beneficial
when I come across other companies that do that.
And I just think it's really nice.
It's like, you know, I mean, everybody could keep it secret.
It's, you know, theoretically none of anybody's business,
but I think it's nice to see on the customer end,
it's really nice to see, you know, what am I buying into?
I have had a couple of people that have approached me
and just were very frank and honest and said,
hey, I get the sense that you're just some random dude.
How do I know this is going to be around in a year?
Why should I throw any money at this?
Like, what's up?
And so that kind of helped contribute to that decision
as well.
It's like, OK, well, if you want to see
that this is a reasonably healthy endeavor,
I mean, I'm not going to retire off of it.
It's just totally a side hustle.
I've got a day job.
Actually, earlier today, I did the math on how many active subscriptions I'd have to have
to equate to the income from my regular career official day job.
And it's just like a terrifyingly large number.
It's a number that will never happen.
So, it's, you know, this is and always will be a side hustle.
That's all it was intended to be.
So yeah, I thought, you know, hey, what's the harm?
Like worst case scenario, someone sees those numbers
and draws some kind of conclusion from them
that I might not want them to draw,
but so far it's been really good.
So far there's been nothing but really positive feedback.
And I think I've kind of proven the point
that the income takes care of the costs.
Nobody has to worry about servers getting shut down
or anything like that.
It's self-sustaining.
- You said two things that are very interesting right now.
So the first one being people have approached you with the,
which I think a lot of people get
when they're building services like this,
that you're just one guy.
How do I know you're gonna be here in whatever?
Which I always think is such a weird argument
when you look at the landscape of the internet
and the number of massive companies
that just get bought up by even larger companies
and then are just hucked in the garbage
and you're left with literally no recourse
of anything to do about it.
using a number of these kind of services now,
come to mind like, you know,
Blot is one where it's one or two people,
maybe or maybe a handful.
Will he be around in 10 years?
I hope so.
If he's not, well, you know,
neither was a Google Reader.
The next person to sign up will be 969.
So let's get through to a thousand
'cause that would be great.
And also the fact that you said you looked up,
you know, like how many you would need to be sustaining
to have your income matched and all that.
It's the same kind of thing where once it becomes that,
the product is not the same thing anymore, right?
Where right now it is, it's fun,
you can build it the way you want it, do what you want.
Oh, I want it to do X, Y, or Z.
Cool, do it.
As soon as you're now from subscription 1,000,
now you're at subscription 100,000,
the whole game changes and nothing is the same anymore.
So I completely understand the charging a nominal,
you know, just enough to maybe keep things going
so you're not just, you know,
hemorrhaging money on server costs and stuff.
- Now I have two questions.
- Two questions.
- Two questions.
I have two questions.
Question number one for you, Adam,
is looking over the experience of having made this service,
interacting with people, seeing the people sign up,
what would you say is the most interesting
or important thing that you have learned
as the developer of this?
- There's probably, there's two things
that leapt to mind immediately.
One is that I am learning every single day.
I went into this thinking, oh, I can do this.
This is easy.
It's just a little bit of this and a little bit of that,
and it's gonna be fine.
No, I have fallen down and stumbled so many times
in a really quiet behind the scenes sort of way.
Been humbled multiple times by hilarious technical failures
that again, that nobody would have noticed or seen,
but that were like deeply embarrassing
when I look at log files.
And so, the one thing I've learned is that
I still have so much to learn.
The other thing is really just the value
in listening to people.
And I come at this with my opinions and my preferences
and I sort of see it as my thing
and I build it the way I wanna build it.
Very introspective, very sort of personal.
I mean, like I said, I even registered the domain
just for the purpose of having a silly email address for me.
So I mean, I've kind of go into all this thinking,
oh, okay, well, what am I gonna do next?
What am I gonna add to it or tweak or change?
But the reality is that the suggestions I get from customers,
the suggestions I get from people that are part of this
kind of small, funky community that I have
kind of built around this are really just absolute gold.
And so just listening in a way that I never thought I would,
I honestly just kind of thought that this would be
like an invisible thing that, you know,
no one would see the man behind the screen
and it would just collect five bucks
and give people their stuff and that would be it.
And it's actually, I mean, really what I've learned
is that there's a constant human interaction dynamic
and I love it, it's wonderful.
- That's a wonderful answer.
And I know that that reminds me of the conversation
that I think we were having broadly
on the Hemispheric Views Discord,
which if listeners haven't joined, check it out.
Nice people on there, Adam's one of them.
That whole point of the internet not really being a place
where people listen to each other very well.
So the fact that you can get feedback from people,
you can iterate, you can improve things
and you take your service in a different direction.
That's great.
And funnily enough, podcasting,
that's just popped into my mind.
People listen to podcasts a lot.
So why people are so good at listening to podcasts
but not listening to each other face-to-face
or behind a keyboard is kind of interesting.
That brings me to the second question,
which is far less interesting or hard hitting,
as Jason would say.
Prior to making this service, or even just following it,
Have you ever made a habit of actually saying the words
or contractions, OMG and LOL, day to day?
Are they actually part of your vernacular?
- Sometimes.
People who know me know that I will drop an LOL or an ROFL
or other forms of that in my typing.
I do it at work.
It's a really bad habit.
I mean, I work for a large healthcare company,
know, Fortune 100 healthcare company. And it's like not the kind of place where you should be
doing that, but I kind of do it anyway. So yeah, I guilty as charged. It is part of my vernacular.
And I'm not ashamed. So wait, I got one more thing. I just realized you dusted off programming
skills. You said for this, you clearly have design skills as well, because like the website is
beautiful. It looks lovely. I love everything about it. Is that are you doing all of that as
well? Or were you a designer who then did programming? Or what's the story there?
There is no story. That's the funny thing. And it's like, I'm stumbling over answering
this because of like the constant nonstop imposter syndrome that I feel over both
design related work and programming and development related work. I'm self-taught in both.
I look at the amazing things that people do online for inspiration and just always blown
away at the creativity that's out there. And I try to emulate that as best I can in what I do.
But no, I have no formal training in either.
Well, Martin, have you bought an account?
In the course of this conversation, I thought, why can't I be number 969?
I am going to give away five omg.lol accounts. All right, keep an eye out. I'm going to give
away five accounts somehow. I don't know how, but I'll give them away. There you go.
And Matt and Mars and what is your account can we go look at it now well at the moment you're looking at this is the future home of Martin Feld dot OMG dot lol.
Amazing thanks Adam for coming along we invited you on the show and subsequent to that you actually became a listener of our show and a a patron supporter as well so how dare you know like you've really stepped it up that wasn't part of the the contract that you signed to come onto the show but it's great to have you as a member.
member of our community. And yeah, thanks for thanks for joining us here.
The show is amazing. I absolutely love listening. And I'm honored to be a guest
today. I really appreciate it.
Thanks so much for joining us, Adam. It's been a pleasure. And we're just thrilled that people
listen to us. It's another thing entirely to have them come on to our show. So it's been a
pleasure.
Thank you again.
Okay, so great guest. And now
Who was that guy?
I don't know.
No idea.
That's what I think they call that a zoom bomb.
Is that what that's called?
Where somebody just shows up because you don't password protect your thing.
He seemed nice.
You talk to him.
Yeah.
He's wearing a black t-shirt, match the rest of us.
He didn't have anything vulgar.
So it's like I say we leave it in, you know, why not?
Two new One Prime Plus subscribers, Adam N and Valerie B. Who could those people be?
Not sure, but we sure appreciate the fact that they have joined one prime plus dot-com
also in
Programming news. I think that's what they call it
We have some updates to the patreon
Pricing tiers to make things a little bit easier and more streamlined
For those looking to either get in the door or just those that have been subscribed for a while
So here's what we've done. We
We, as some people know, we do a newsletter every month on the 10th of the month that
gets pushed out through Patreon, which used to be only part of the global or above tiers,
which was fine.
But at the end of the day, really this information that we're putting in these newsletters is
it's great for everyone.
And we kind of just want everyone to be able to, to interact in it and get something from
this content. So what we've done is we've leveled out all the tiers so that if you're
a Southern supporter, Northern supporter, or Global supporter, you all get the newsletter
now and you all get all of the OnePrime Plus bonus shows. The fact that there's the Global
supporter tier is just, if you feel like you want to kick a little extra in there, that's
totally fine. We very much appreciate it. What we have done is we've removed the top
tier that was the $11 tier and just bumped everyone that was in that back down to the
$5 tier. So bottom line is, whatever tier you were at, you're going to get the same
or more than what you already had, and you're free to move around to whatever tier you want.
I would say we don't care, but I'll say I don't care. Pick whatever tier you want. It
Doesn't matter just want to give you extra stuff
Yeah
It's more than we just want everybody to be able to get everything at the end of the day to make it more more
Simplistic and just more enjoyable for everybody. So there's just three tiers now
There's nothing that anyone has to do from a patreon standpoint
If you're already on patreon if you're not check it out now you get even more stuff than you would have gotten before
so one prime plus calm will give you all the information you need for that and
And really just a sincere thank you to everybody that's already a patron or anybody that's
thinking about becoming a patron.
It's super cool that anybody cares at all what we're doing.
So thank you.
I had a bit of drama recently that I want to share.
You know, we all use the cloud.
I was at work recently, like worky work, you know, like jobby job stuff, working on some
documents.
It's a business environment.
There's some Office 365 going on there.
Everybody loves a little Office 365.
Office 365 has OneDrive, which is their cloud offering.
And that integrates with all your words,
and your Excels, and your points of power.
- Incollaborate.
- Working on some very, very lengthy Word documents
that were very, very dense.
technical documentation type stuff, right?
That coincidentally is gonna be submitted
to the US government for approval.
So a little bit important, right?
Working on two documents side by side,
close my laptop to go to a meeting,
open it back up, have said meeting,
come back to my desk,
pop the laptop back on the little stand,
open my two documents up,
boom, I've got little red alert things on my OneDrive.
go into the useless logs of OneDrive to have it say that something to the effect of "All
the edits you've made for the past three hours, those are gone."
I'm sorry, they're gone?
Okay, well, it's the cloud, so clearly there was versioning, because when you have something
in OneDrive, it's continually saving your versions, right?
So you go, "Whatever, I'll revert."
No, all of the three hours of data just gone.
This was, you know, you guys probably have done the track changes, right?
That's like a thing, right?
So those changes were all gone.
Three hours of intense document editing just completely vanished.
Cautionary tale, the cloud doesn't always have your back.
I want to turn it into tech support corner. Are you also running one drive?
Desktop sync hate it. Don't touch that
No, I am NOT
Okay, cuz I was gonna say if you are maybe it's synced back to your local save folders and then like some time machine
Backblows thing had grabbed it. No this this was strictly
100% on off of one drive and it just wiped it
And Martin, you seem like you hate that.
I also have to use OneDrive, Microsoft products.
I rely on keeping everything saved locally, and I rarely use the direct save to OneDrive.
I'm just syncing it. I'm not editing directly in the cloud.
Because I want to be able to, like, grab my files, you know, like, there they are.
They're in a folder. I know what I'm dealing with.
I don't know I can use them in the file system like on any other thing and then they sync what's this cloud business
Tell me about this cloud business
I've been doing it in one drive because I was under the I guess false assumption that it was continually doing
Versioning while it was in there and I thought that was the benefit of having it in there
But I learned of the hard way that that was not the case
So just remember
Cloud not always your friend. I
Did an Apple trade-in have you guys ever done an Apple trade-in? Yes
In person. No. Yes. Okay, so I did my first in-person Apple trade-in and it was
Pretty awesome. I happen to be looking at the trade-in program and they were willing to give me
$450
For an 11 pro that is just sitting on a shelf
I'll take it sign me up. It's good deal
Yeah, I was very surprised clearly the 11 pro is holding value for some reason
So I go through the process to do the 11 11 pro trade in I was doing it actually as a part of actually bought
A new phone. I don't think I ever told you guys so I did it as a part of that and then I went in
Pam was there to meet me
Pam was great. She said alright, we're gonna get you
Get you through this process and she puts the phone down she has her little I call it like a like a hyper iPod because it's like a iPod touch but it's got like that big giant thing around it that's got like yeah it's got like a.
It's been assimilated into the.
Exactly it's got like an NFC reader and a card reader and buttons on the back and all kinds of.
I think that's the only reason they still make iPod touches is a people at Apple stores can use them.
Yeah, totally.
So she brings out her Borg iPod Touch, which I'm already like, "Whoa, that's, yeah, let's
do that.
That looks great."
And she sets it next to the phone that I brought in, and she starts scanning numbers off the
screen, right?
Which is a new thing that we can do now with, I think iOS 15, I think, maybe 14.
But so she's just scanning, you know, serial number, IMEI number, all that stuff.
It's going into her little system.
Cool.
She's talking about whatever along the way, very cordially conversation.
It was great.
She was very nice.
And then all these like crazy diagnostic screens started showing up on the phone that I brought
in.
So it's doing some kind of inter Wi-Fi remote diagnostics, I'm guessing to the back room
probably.
And it's doing things on the screen.
It's checking different colors and checking the cameras and doing different tests.
It was super cool how it was just doing this remote diagnostic and she seemingly did nothing
other than just put it on the Wi-Fi that was at the store.
So it was very, it's just, I would love to know how that system works where it can just
say, okay, I see a phone on our network.
It has this, you know, serial number, boop, boop, boop.
And now it's doing all these crazy diagnostics.
It was very cool to watch.
I felt a little bad because I was obviously ignoring her nice conversation that she would
normally be having to, you know, make me think it's not taking a long time, but I
was very interested in what was going on with these phones where she was just
saying something. I was like, wait, uh, what? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Yeah.
Back of screen, Pam got back to screen.
Hold on. I didn't see that. What was that diagnostic doing? Um, so yeah, she did
all of that and it tested out fine. You know, obviously it was, the phone was
perfect condition. I brought it in the damn box. So it's like, it was probably
Can I ask you a question? Did Pam know about Monterey?
I don't think Monterey came up.
Okay, because I went to an Apple store recently and it was the day of the Monterey release.
And it was chit-chat and I said, "Hey, you know, big day. It's Monterey Day today."
And she's like, "It's what?"
It's like, you know, the new operating system for your Macs, it's out today.
Huh, really?
Oh yeah.
Huh.
I feel like there might be need a little more training in Perth.
Well, it's funny you say that because to get my 12 mini, I did an in-person trade-in
of my 11 Pro.
This was a while ago now, or, you know, within that last cycle.
And the person I gave it to at the Miranda Apple Store in South Sydney, where we drove
up said, "Have you ever used this phone?"
No, wasn't even a microabrasion. So did you get to see your trade in, Martin? Did you see the
cool screens and stuff or did they take it away?
I didn't see cool screens, but I was, like you said, I think I was the opposite of you. I was
intently involving this man in conversation.
Oh, of course. Yeah.
So much to the point that it was actually slowing the process.
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Yeah. That's the difference between-
He was like, yes, yes, if anyone wanted to know the difference between Martin and myself, there you go right there
He's he's full in talking to Pam and I'm like Pam. I need a minute. I'm watching some screens here
Natasha stood very politely next to me and just said yes. Yes. Yes
What he's like and you know, he doesn't have you know, he doesn't put in a case. Nope. He's he's an Apple nerd. That's it
Mm-hmm. Yeah, so she she does a very good job of balancing
Supporting her husband at the Apple Store and really keeping him in check and making fun of him with the staff
So look I commend it for that. Yeah, I do too. I appreciate everything about that.
Yeah, I bought some more stuff guys. Ever since we started doing this podcast. I know you've ruined
me. I didn't used to spend money. This is the number one excuse of all tech podcasters, you
know, I need it because I do a podcast. Come on, I'm using Apple ear pods here plugged into my
It's specifically Jason. I'm just going to call it out. It's not,
it's not the podcast. It's Jason.
Why is it my fault?
Why you're saying that of all the people that I would be the one to just
willy nilly make you want to buy things.
Because you acknowledged that my Thunderbolt driver
array was noisy.
Oh, that's a, yeah, that's a disaster.
I don't know how you allow that to happen in your life.
So yeah, I had my,
I was very proud to buy that to replace a broken down NAS that died a couple of years
ago.
And I was like, "Thunderbolt, brilliant, fast, super fast.
NAS was a pain in the butt.
One less thing to manage, excellent."
Thunderbolt needs like, the cord can be about 15 centimeters.
Any longer than that, it doesn't work.
So what I did instead is I considered my options.
I ran it by my wife, Hannah, and she authenticated my wish on the basis of it's an occ health
and safety issue because you can't just have a noisy hard drive spinning next to your head
all day every day.
So I went to Apple and I bought a M1 Mac Mini that is now my server that's sitting in a
cupboard and plugged into it inside the cupboard is the Thunderbolt drive array.
I'm relying so defeats the purpose of the speedy connection of Thunderbox now I'm relying on
Ethernet connections to get my data back off it my study my office is now deathly silent
except when I boot my iMac and
Then the fans crank up on that thing, but generally it's super quiet
And I'm now looking for ways to use another computer as a server
So I'm open to ideas because I don't want to have this asset sitting there just running a hard drive that seems bonkers
Can I ask a more blunt and perhaps stupid question? Why do you need the server?
Because because it's a Thunderbolt driver a it needs to be it doesn't have a computer and it's just a
It's just drives. So it's the dumb hard drive. No, I understand. But what's on this array?
all my data
That you use frequently it's all a lot of stuff that a lot of devin think databases. Do you use this stuff frequently? Yeah
Really? Yeah, really? Yeah
Okay, I think we're from different planets go on. Well, it's I mean it's running plexus. Well, it's running plex
Yeah, and it's got a full backup and it's my my
iCloud photos
Stored locally and it's my content cache server
But you know how these things lead to one thing to another now all of a sudden I've had to buy a static IP address
because apparently
My ISP that I came back to after a period away have implemented
Something called carrier grade NAT
Which is basically a way of them sharing IP
Addresses between multiple customers and so basically so we're not talking about an insect
So it's like so now for the biostatic IP address this is ridiculous right what's a static IP go for in in Perth
$5 a month
Yeah
You could get an OMG address for $5 a year
No, that's that that pricing is stuffed up my perspective on everything
So anyway, that's my story. I've got another Mac in the house
But I want to propose a new game. I want the listeners to guess
What new Mac Andrew will have in the next episode I just find it infuriating that I bought a new
Fast Mac, but I couldn't use it because it doesn't have a screen
I'm still I still love this
IMAX screen so much you should have shoved the crappy iMac in the closet to do this job and just use the m1
I'm at her Mac mini is your main computer at the screen
That's where you buy a pro display. Yeah as recommended in that garage video where the guy does the startup music
Wait only one you buy two come on
Yeah, you can push it.
Go for it.
You gotta have the stand and the nano-coated display.
No, that's right.
He does need two because one's the main one and one goes to the side vertically where
he does his spreadsheet buzzer.
Also, it turns out if you want to run screens, like if you want to VNC into it at a reasonable
resolution when you're using headless, you also go out and buy a dongle, which I didn't
realize I've now realized I'm waiting for my dongle to arrive because otherwise you're
running at some really low resolution.

- Okay, so special announcement
from the Hemispheric Views team.
November is the month that we have now entered.
And you know what?
It's alliteration when you put it with the word nostalgic.
NN, nostalgic November.
That's what we're gonna be launching.
We want you dear listeners to share stuff with us
that you're nostalgic about this November.
We'll be kicking it off.
You'll see in the show notes links to little things.
could be on our blog, could be on our YouTube, you'll see.
We're gonna talk about things that are nostalgic for us.
And we want you to submit it to us,
whether it's @hemisphericpod on Twitter,
hemisphericviewsonmicro.blog,
maybe chuck it in the general Discord feed,
hell, even email it to us if you want
at hello@hemisphericviews.com.
Think of something that you're nostalgic about.
It could be from your childhood,
it could be something from before you were alive,
but now you have direct experience with,
it could be a film, tech product, something intangible,
something that makes you happy and feel a little bit nostalgic or, you know, warm and fuzzy all over,
we want to know what it is. And then at the end of the month, we're going to collate all of the
collections that we can keep track of and make a nice little blog post at the end to share on our
site that sums up basically what this hemispheric community really loves and finds important in
their lives. Anything you two want to add to that? I'm going to have to try and think about what I'm
nostalgic about. Because somebody like myself, I'm ever looking forward.
But this very practice reaches back into the pilot episode for this podcast.
How did we start doing this? We talked about as international Mac nerds, what was
important to us, what got us started, what we're into when we were younger, that has
then led us to this point of gasbagging on the Internet constantly.
So I think it's a nice thing to step back and think about.
We've had several listener community members, I guess we can call them
Hemispherians. Have we come up with a name for these people? Is that what they are?
I like the Hemispherians.
Okay. We've had several Hemispherians now that have gone back for some reason, I can't imagine
why, and listened to like episode zero through, you know, whatever was the most recent, which
sounds awful to me, but thank you for doing it. And I'm just, I just can't believe that they would
do that. So almost this show is going to be nostalgia for someone at some point.
Brimetta.
That's fascinating to think about.
