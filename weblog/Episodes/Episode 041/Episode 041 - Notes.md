We're joined by Adam Newbold (aka [@neatnikllc](https://twitter.com/neatnikllc)), creator of [omg.lol](https://omg.lol), to discuss what went into making his service and the experience of being an indie developer. Since agreeing to our interview, he has even become a listening Hemispherean!

This month, we also launch our own Nostalgic November, inviting you to share a memory of anything from your past that brings a smile to your face, be it a movie, song, game or product—whatever! Simply send us a quick text, photo or video in one of the following ways: [@HemisphericPod](https://mobile.twitter.com/HemisphericPod) on Twitter with #NostalgicNovember; [@HemisphericViews](https://micro.blog/HemisphericViews) on Micro.blog; in our general [Discord](https://discord.gg/mzdB2ug) chat; or by email to [hello@hemisphericviews.com](https://hello@hemisphericviews.com). At the end of the month, we'll collect all entries into one comprehensive post on our blog to show off what is important to our listening community! To kick things off, see the nostalgic entries from [Andrew](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/articles/nostalgic-november-andrew), [Jason](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/articles/nostalgic-november-jason) and [Martin](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/articles/nostalgic-november-martin) on our blog.
