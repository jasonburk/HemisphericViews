So Jason, you bought a whole bunch of new audio gear and now it's failed on you.
Is that what's going on?
No, well, two corrections.
I did not buy a bunch of new audio gear.
One new audio gear to replace a bunch of audio gear.
I'm not so sure that it has failed as much as I have failed to not properly look into
how the whole thing works.
Rather just kind of dove in and hoped for the best.
So there's work to be done there.
What was that one thing?
That is the Elgato Wave XLR.
And I got that to replace all the other crap on my desk.
The Focusrite Scarlett whatever and the Cloudlifter CL something.
Why?
There's just too much stuff.
Too many things.
And this thing I think will fix that.
And it has touch sensitive mute button on the top.
Which is like, oh, how I have missed a mute button having this other crap that cannot
be controlled through core audio.
Just no mute buttons on the Apple TV remote.
Not into that mute button.
No, that's still the dumbest feature that's ever been added to a remote in history.
So I've hit it probably approximately three times now on accident.
And every time it's like, what, why is this?
This is the worst button.
Is there a mute button?
Yeah, on the new Siri remote.
There is now, because they...
I've got that.
I hadn't even noticed it.
Oh, did you forget that they fixed the remote?
Whatever that means?
Yeah, I went and bought one.
I've been using it fairly heavily during ad breaks on live, you know, free to wear Olympics telecasts.
You have to sit through ads.
Yeah. Speaking of Olympics, Patreon shout out to the NBL Pocket Podcast.
Look at that tie in. I know that guy.
Did you see that tie in though?
That's like that's some professional level stuff right there.
Tying Olympics, NBL.
It's it's like I'm a regular sports guy.
I was watching Japan play basketball last night and noticing that Yudai Baba was
playing for Japan in the starting lineup.
He's also coming off a championship with the Melbourne United team in the NBL.
I saw that robot throw the ball into the hole and I thought that was probably the
coolest thing that ever could come from the Olympics.
That was so, that was like the perfect.
We're in Japan moment for the Olympics.
Wasn't that?
I don't know why that's not just the Olympics.
I think every sport, everyone should just make robots
to do that sport.
That's the challenge.
Like we're over people at this point.
We know what their limits are.
Let's get some robot Olympics going
and have them compete instead.
- I wanna know that he made a free throw
and then a three point shot and a half court shot.
Could they have just kept on backing him back?
Like could he have gone free court?
- Why did they not?
Why did it end there?
That was my question.
I thought for sure it would just keep going
And he would be like a quarter mile away, like throwing this ball and still just making it perfect every time.
That would have been really exciting.
While we're on the topic of basketball, Andrew, what's your thought on the whole 3x3 thing?
I'm a traditionalist, I don't really like it.
What is that?
It's for the kids, right?
Is that like the size of the court they play in a square instead of a rectangle?
No, it's actually two teams of four players, hence they call it 3x3.
It's half a court, isn't it?
Yeah, it's three by three on the half court at any one time not even a half court
It's almost like a third of a court three pointers count for two points and two pointers count for one point
Because that makes sense all right you take a game. That's well established everyone knows how it works you change literally everything about it
Mm-hmm and somehow
Pretend like it's the same game well
You're American and you know American movies when you say like Street Tuffs or ragamuffins like you know playing on a court
But only addressing one of the hoops sure you know how that kind of congregate around there
Just imagine that in an Olympic setting but without the street toughness. That's what they're doing
Oh that sounds boring if you want to get bonus points you find Billy Hoyle on the sidelines and
Billy Hoyle Billy Hoyle and you're like you take the chump what the chump you get the chump come on Jason
You know what's happening and our thanks to NBL podcast

plus.com now on the topic of Japan I want to know Andrew's latest Toyota
update the Toyota update is the Toyota is now in my garage
Wow that was quick. Congratulations. I have it. It arrived, picked it up two days ago now, bought the car, I rock up, they've got the car under like a black curtain sheet with like a little red ribbon on it.
Like a commercial. To do the big reveal like Andrew Canyon this is your car. I've never experienced that before, I didn't know that sort of thing was actually done. There you go.
It's a nice car I have to say.
I have to say.
There is, I have only discovered one flaw with the car in 48 hours.
Which is pretty good for me.
I've only discovered one downside.
It's the wrong color.
There's lots of upsides.
It's beautiful.
Hybrid.
Red.
Fiery red.
It's a wonderful car.
One problem.
No Qi charger.
No.
No.
Come on guys.
Return it.
I contemplated it. Well, I thought maybe I needed to buy a little cheap ad and plug it into the
USB socket and make my own chi charger. I would have thought that was like pretty standard by now
So it has carplay. Well, this is the other thing carplay and now this is I haven't obviously haven't read any books
Haven't looked at the manuals. Just just mucked around with it
Carplay works when you plug it in but I haven't discovered carplay working
With Bluetooth, which I think is a feature of carplay
Mmm, there's two different kinds. There's wired
Carplay and then there's wireless carplay, right and you don't always get both
That's my understanding. I think there's a specific
I don't know if it's just strictly called wireless carplay or there's another word for it
But I think there's something special and different about it versus wired carplay
So since you seem to know what you're talking about Jason
Because CarPlay
Comes after the setup does that mean that to use wireless CarPlay you'd have to go through whatever
Cars horrible Bluetooth system there is with the enter your digits and here's the scrambled token thing in order to use it
Good question my assumption would be yes, although you would think by plugging it in it would do all that in the background
but because I think the CarPlay stuff is so siloed from the rest of the
Horrible car interface that probably not so I would definitely give that a try
I have done that connected first has done the Bluetooth connection thing in me Bob
But I don't know if I've actually in a bit. I don't think I haven't been able to enable carplay
Remotely, but I'm kind of not that fussed about it either because the one time I did use carplay on another car
Wirelessly it was it crashed like so often
And I don't know whether that was the car or the software version or carplay, but it wasn't a reliable thing
So I'm kind of okay with it being a plug-in unless I upgrade to like an iPhone 13
That doesn't have a plug at all in which case I'm stuffed, right?
I mean it takes a half a second to plug it in and then it's charging via plugged in charging
Yeah, the wireless carplay was always kind of a okay. That sounds nice. But in practice
I don't really know if it's that big of a deal. I did today
Go and because I know my pride in my new car will last about a month. So I'm maximizing this period
I stopped in at Bunnings and I bought a
little hand vacuum cleaner thing
So I can clean the carpets at any drop of a hat and I bought a chamois
So I can give it a wipe down and then after a month you'll never do it again. Exactly. Exactly. Okay. Got it
That's good. Oh, yeah Toyota update at least it'll be nice for a month
Yeah, if you see a guy cruising around a rape car wave it could be me
Today is
My son David's 10th birthday. Happy birthday. Happy 10th birthday
Yep, that's a big one big one double digits. It's been being pretty excited about this one
We've enjoyed an evening out went to a restaurant for dinner. Did you have cake?
We had a delicious cake his grandma Nona made it for him
Double like riches anything chocolate. I'm still feeling a bit sick from it like getting sort of stuff like no
No, it's like a fan. It's a week. It's called a wicked cake. Oh
Wow, it's very chocolatey cool right up a kid's alley. It's up my alley - don't get me wrong
It's really delicious, but you can't eat a lot of it. Yeah a little bit of a cake coma now
Yeah, but yeah, happy birthday little buddy. You're a champ
Happy 10th birthday. Now. I believe you also bought yourself a gift on your son's birthday. Yeah. Yeah, I did
Well as you do that's customary if I think it's all that me, right? I'm buying I'm spending money left front and center
And who is this guy? Well, I realized today
I was in the city for a work meeting and I got to the end of that meeting and I realized that tonight was the
I was cracking out the M1 to do a podcast recording because we talked in the past that it seemed like there's some
My my Intel seems just too slow to handle you guys and the sync and too slow. Let's try this M1
Yeah, and then I realized I would be relying on Wi-Fi
And is that something you want to put when you're recording you're doing zoom and you're recording audio
Do you really want to be reliant on the vagaries of Wi-Fi?
Well after the last year of dealing with me prior to this cable the answer is no
So I reflect precedent for this I reflected on Martin's experience and I thought I need horrible
I need a an adapter
so I went to the Apple Store and
I
Wondered I looked at the shelves randomly and just as I found the thing I needed somebody came and asked me if I needed any
Help and I said yeah, I think I'm okay. I've got a Belkin USB
C to gigabit Ethernet adapter, so I asked the assistant is it does that happen to be an Apple branded one nope
She wasn't sure she looked on her little iPad iPod thingy me ball that they carry around
Nope, that's fine. I'll take the Belkin and then I thought well. I'm here. What else can I do with my
Might as well get a pro XDR display while I'm here
I guess I just spread shit on his phone internet was disrupted big spender off you go
Well, you see I had I had the Apple voucher burning a hole in my pocket from my trade-in at my iPad
So I wandered over and I was like, what else can I buy? I don't really need anything. What about these air tags?
Mmm air tags Wow, the assistant was still with me, right?
She sort of just latched on so she wandered me over to the air tag area and I said now this is my little test
I'm like now tell me these air tags. Do they work as effectively?
With my iPhone being an iPhone 10 are
As opposed to an iPhone 12 like will it be then she just walked away as accurate and she was like I
Don't know actually and she said I've got an iPhone
I don't know what she said she had an iPhone was but it wasn't the 12
She's like mine is a bit wonky when it gets nearby as well. It doesn't really lock on I said, ah, yeah
Well, actually the iPhone 12 has a special chip designed to enable it to find and she's
Oh, okay. You told her that basically. Yeah, we quickly then switched into me being the sales guy
Oh, there we go
And then she latched on to you and you sold her something and then everything broke down
Yeah, pretty much and then she reversed the favor. So I was like, I'll take one air tag
So she sold me on she said you just want a cheap cover. You don't want one of the Apple. It's expensive
You want the Belkin and I was like, I know that that's what Martin got
So straight away I was very comfortable buying it knowing that it had the Martin seal of approval
I think the Belkin one's great. That's the one I have on my keys. I like it
It's nice and it's like solid plastic and and goes on your keys nice. So yeah, so basically there we go
And I said to her well look even if it doesn't work very well
She told me I could return it within 14 days if I didn't like it and she also told me that you know
If it's not good with my current phone get a new one. I was like, yeah, that's right
They'll release a new one in September and she said oh, maybe they will I hear the chip shortage is impacting Apple as well
So there you go heard it first Apple store representative the chip crisis has hit Apple
There you go. We may not get our iPhones in September. Thank you, New York Times
She didn't know what the u1 chip was but she knows all about their supply chain very intimately
Exactly. Very good. This sounds like a solid source. I would contact
the the nine-to-five verge or whatever the hell immediately
Run by Ming Chi Kuo, whatever his name is. Yeah. Wow. This sounds like hot hot take. I think she might have been feeling you
Feels maybe that could be the case
But there you go. I bought stuff. So, you know kid has birthday by yourself gifts. Happy birthday, David
Thank you for keeping the economy going in Perth
Unannounced trivia corner. Oh
Wow
I'm ready to lose again. This is what happens when Jason gets an extra hour of sleep
question one
How many is it milli amp hours? I believe is the term was in the iPhone 3gs battery
Is it?
1219
1483
1507 or
26
Martin you take this away. I'm gonna go B
Okay, what was B? I'm gonna say it had a 3 at the end. So I thought that was interesting
Was it was there an option of 1412?
There was not. Oh, what was that one? What was the 1400 one the one Martin chose?
1483
3 at the end. There's also 1000
1219 yeah, I want that one
Okay, you are locked in follow-up question because there has to be two it's the rules
What is the current version of Android is?
it
9
12
11 or 10
You first Andrew I took the early one
Krispy Kreme chocolate donut version. Yeah, I liked it when they use those version numbers 12
Okay, no looking at your Android phone
I'll go for 11 just because they're all in sync at the moment and you know Windows 11
They're not really the same company, but whatever
Nope, not at all, but
But you know Windows has Android apps now so basically is that's true via the via the Amazon App Store like probably the best
Possible way that you could ever run apps. Thank you for playing unannounced trivia corner
Fantastic answers will probably not be in the show notes and that will drive a number of our patreon supporters crazy
I don't make the rules. All right, I just read the questions
So what's next? Okay. So next topic. I believe this is a patreon
members benefit to suggest a topic is and this topic suggestion is from
Gabriel, but it's more it's a bit of a Hispanic name as well. So you can sort of go. Yeah, Brielle
Can you is that kind of how you do it? I'm not kind of Italian. That was more Italian wasn't it?
Yeah, Jason basically you know
If if you want to have your
namesake and/or culture
Completely ruined by any of us at any time you can go to one prime plus calm
Give money to then have us butcher
Everything about your culture. Thank you. So anyway, what is his?
Suggested topic today. I have written down in our show notes here
Backups or backup strategy. I reckon we'll probably be pretty similar Andrew. Do you want to start?
I'll start I'll start when I back up generally in the new Toyota. I'll put it in reverse
It doesn't make much noise just easy. It's got cameras all over the place. It's really easy not to hit things
So that and then I just back up into the parking spot
Does it make a weird no it probably makes a weird noise right because it's electric
Yeah, it's okay. It's a clunks a little bit
No like to tell people that you're
Not a thing there. Yeah, I think it's really a thing
I know the thing you're talking about, but I haven't noticed that thing
Okay, cuz I know here I think they have to make a weird noise if they're going under a certain
Speed so you can actually hear it. I guess I don't know. I'm not fully sure what simulated anyways
So you have the new backup in the Toyota? Yeah. Yeah, and then so that that sorts the car out look sometimes
I'll occasionally think about backing up with regards to a computer as well, which maybe what are you talking about?
I'm not really sure I'm gonna go out on a limb and just assume he probably meant data on a computer not
In a car, but I could be wrong go with that. Okay. Well, I can cover that really quickly. Basically I
have a
time-machine backup going to my
velcro taped hard drive under my desk
Like a 3m sticky thing. I've stuck a little hard drive under my desk. That is my time machine. I
Did for a period have a occasional
SuperDuper copy clone of my computer
Which I would do randomly and sporadically
I've given up on that ever since it got too hard to get boot partitions and all that working
I just gave up too difficult
and I also pay for
Backblaze not a sponsor really good service been happy with it, but I only back up my
iMac and it's connected giant drive the laptop the m1 laptop that I'm using now
I'm just living on the edge with this bad boy
I have zero backups to this thing because it's basically just a satellite so it just relies on cloud data from everything else
So it's not really ever got anything. I had a raid enclosure at one point and NAS drive with a raid enclosure
You know, it's like raid what and that what could go wrong and it was backed up
Everything everything one drive crashed while I was away for a weekend
So that was the rate array in you're gonna want dual drive redundancy on that
It was in that you know that mode it goes into and one drive crashes
You're like don't wait to write it's a rate array so you can handle that track that crash
But it's just to be clear you keep saying one drive. We're not insulting Microsoft. Oh, that's a crappy sync service as well
Yeah, and then I was like with my raid array
I've got by the time I got back and changed over the drive and then it tried to recopy
The amount of effort that it put on the other drive that was similarly aged as it tried to resync
Renais everything caused that drive to fail which ultimately meant my entire right array was bought
So raid I've got another raid array now, but it's not an ass. It's just a
AWC Thunder Bay I can feel that he's very glad he asked this question now
He's getting a lot of really good a lot of backup professional wisdom here. I think is what I'm bang for his patreon buck
Mm-hmm, but you know Martin. What are you doing? Well look I use time machine just on I have two little
USB-C
hard drives, you know, I would love a few of those Samsung T5 or T7 things, but I can't
really justify the money going and buying all of those.
Maybe eventually I will, I don't know.
But I like to have two physical time machine backups in case something goes wrong.
I also subscribe to Backblaze.
I just have that schedule thing, you know, syncing with the cloud server or whatever
when I go to bed after we have recorded this podcast and uploaded files, because then you
would never receive the uploaded files.
I think that actually happened once and that was a nightmare.
So yes, schedule after 1am, please start,
because then the Australian internet in New South Wales will break.
So there's that.
I just do want to say, though, I kind of miss the fact
that Apple used to do the time capsules, you know, like the airport extreme
with the built in drive.
I never had one of those, but I would love to have that constantly whirring
in the house because I'm fairly diligent with backing up
to those little time machine drives that I have.
But you know you go, oh did I do that recently?
And you go up to the menu bar and you go,
oop, that was a little while ago, better do that now.
Whereas the time capture would just be doing it frequently.
And I know it's Wi-Fi and all that stuff,
but I like that idea.
- You like the idea of that thing whirring in your house?
You do not like the reality of it.
I had one, it was the most,
it had the most crummy hard drive in it.
I ultimately replaced the hard drive with a decent one,
but it was never great.
- But things have progressed,
so they could do a nicer, newer one.
- True, true, they could.
I get what you're saying. I understand. But why not a 2021 time capsule?
I'd like to make it make it like a mesh router system as well.
Yeah. What a novel idea. No, Jason's shaking his head.
Nobody wants that. Jason, what about you? I don't back up anything.
I back up everything constantly forever. Are you kidding me? This is like,
it's waiting for it. Yeah. Um, what do I do?
I have a lot of stuff going on here.
So we've got time.
I do run time machine still, um, on a continuously connected drive.
I think it's a four terabyte drive for time machine.
So I can have time machine backups going back to a long time.
It's kind of crazy how far back time machine seems to be able to go
with the amount of space you give it.
It's like, how is it fitting all that?
I don't know, but don't question it.
It's just magic and it works.
Time machine is the thing where you never really care about it, but every once in a
while there'll be that file that somehow just disappeared.
Where'd it go?
Nobody knows.
Like, I didn't delete it.
Yeah, you did.
You're just stupid and you don't realize you deleted it.
And then you pop open time machine.
It does that cool little like window-y looking thing and you slide through the little sidebar
and boom, look, it's back on my desktop.
Oh, I did delete it.
Okay.
Restore.
Time Machine has got to be one of the most under sung heroes of just something that is
a great feature that's built in and just works.
Connect any stupid piece of crap drive you have in a closet and you have a wonderful
backup.
If you have a Mac, plug in a drive, turn on Time Machine, do yourself a favor.
That being said, I have also a 24 terabyte LaCie 6-Big drive connected to my iMac.
That's for all of your professional cinematography, surely?
Correct, yep.
And then, what other drives?
Oh, I do a carbon copy clone of my iMac every Saturday.
And then I have, like everyone else should have, Backblaze for $5 a month slash soon
to be $6 a month.
Rebuy now at the $5 a month price before it goes up.
And that allows me to back up my iMac.
So one terabyte drive in the iMac, as well as all 24 terabytes of the other drive are
backed up into Backblaze as well for $5 a month.
else are you gonna back up? That's why it's not $5 a month anymore Jason. That's why it's
$6 a month now. But it's as long as it's a connected drive to your computer and
you connect it to your computer I think every 30 days at a minimum it will back
it up to Backblaze which is I just I can't understand how you would not spend
$5 a month to just know if everything goes wrong in the world you still have a
copy somewhere of your stuff. Is getting back 24 terabytes going to be fun? No.
Can you imagine Martin uploading 24 terabytes? He'd be an old man by the time it's finished.
Oh, but it would be great fun getting there. This is apparently a Backblaze ad now, but
I cannot speak highly enough of it. I've never had an issue with it. I've restored stuff
from it in the past. It's just a great service and it's I would consider it to
be a must-have for any computer, Windows or otherwise. Whatever it runs on,
get it. Totally agree. Other than that for mobile devices, iCloud backup, I run that.
It runs automatically unless you've turned it off, but I also have a reminder
every Saturday. Saturday is kind of my backup day where I either do backups that need to happen,
so like my craft notes, I'll do a massive export of everything every other week.
That's a huge party day in the Burke household. You get to Saturday, you get to his house,
man it's just backups. What are we gonna do today?
Is Valerie doing the same thing? Is she also committed to backups and then you
reconvene for lunch or something?
No, it's just kind of what I do throughout the day.
Oh
Now yeah, you brought up mobile backups that's important we all do that very important question back to time machine for a second
Do you both agree with me that?
The loss of that starry warp back in time in the time machine interface was a huge loss for the system
Yes, yeah, that was the best. I think that was fun. Wasn't it just a great way of visualizing it fun
it took away the fear and like of
Restoring and backups. I don't want to stuff up but then it's like man
This is cool and immediately got you into the idea of what are you doing? You're moving through time and space
It was perfect. It relieved some stress too because the only time you're using time machine is when you've royally
Messed up I'll say and that was just kind of a yeah, it sucks. But at least I'm in space
Yeah, it kind of reminds me. It's like no you totally right
It's like when you see progress bars that are not only moving or giving you an impression of time underneath
But when they have that little cycling animation to show that something's still happening
You could be enraged going when is this gonna finish up?
But at least it's still working when bars don't do that. It's just like a static solid color line
I kind of line that up in my mind with that time machine interface
Yeah
That's when you have to do the thing where you take your mouse cursor and you put the edge of the mouse cursor on the
Bar where it's stopped. So then you can wait and see if it's actually moving or not
I've done that. Yeah, that that was like a Windows go to move way way way back in the day
It's just like you put move put it right up against the edge and then wait, is it actually moving? Oh, yep
Nope, it moved a little bit. Okay, it is still progressing
Has there been an update on pre-ordering yes, yes there has
Play date Thursday pre-ordering 10 a.m. Pacific Time pretty exciting make sure
you pre-order but only after I pre-order so for people who don't know what we're
talking about Jason the play date a very nostalgic little yellow device with a
crank love it explain love it so panic our friends at panic friends of the show
panic not a sponsor here in Portland Oregon actually they make software people
know about their software. Coda, you may have heard of in the past. Nova now, it's
their code editor. Transmit, the cutest little truck that ever
existed, have decided, you know what? Software is cool, but you know what's
cooler? Little weird esoteric gaming hardware. That's cooler. So they've made
the Playdate, which is a little handheld, reminiscent, sort of a Game Boy looking
kind of thing. Pretty standard screen on top, D-pad, A, B buttons, and the thing that you
know you're probably familiar with from consoles like the Nintendo Switch, a little tiny hand
crank on the side. You know, the very standard input that all game consoles have. I think
my PS5 has a little handle on the side to crank, so it's pretty standard.
You sharpen your pens over that.
Yeah.
Or the Hills Hoist clothesline.
Yes, good reference Wow, thank you. So yeah, they've they've gone down this path of creating hardware
It looks amazing. Everything I've heard so far is that it is amazing and great. They've done a nice job with it
It's finally going on pre-order
this week and then I think it's supposed to ship or the I should say the first batch of
20,000 I believe
Which sounds like a lot but in my head, I'm like crap. Am I gonna be able to get one?
I think they go on or they go to shipping I believe before the end of the year
Which I'm not exactly sure what that means. Is that like, you know, December 31st or
October I don't know but good news
We actually are getting it and you're getting more games now than you were initially because there's seasons of games
Is how this thing is gonna work?
So you buy the unit you get season one of the games for for free comes with it
I think it's like 12 games or something. The other cool thing is that you can just make games for it
and put them on yourself if you want. It's got a whole interface or a whole like SDK or whatever
and then you can just side load games willy-nilly. From the video that they showed it looked like it
was appropriate for like kids and adults, like it was really accessible. It's everyone yeah I don't
think there really is a, I mean I'm sure for legal reasons there's an age range but I don't see
either being any reason why it's not for for everyone.
So who intends to order one? Jason, yeah?
Oh hell yeah.
I'm not even really into games massively. I mean not as much as I used to be. I've said
that before. My favorite mobile game is still the brick game on the iPod. Yeah, you know
that. But I think I'll be getting up to order one if I can. Yeah, I'm actually fairly interested
in this.
I plan on making a game for it. That's my my big goal is to make a game for it by the
end of the... well, I mean if I have one by the end of the year.
What about you Andrew?
I've been excited about this since it was first mentioned years ago and I've always
said to myself I'm gonna order, I'm gonna get one of those straight away.
Then I got the email where it was like time to pre-order and I said to myself do I really
want this thing?
Like I hardly ever play Nintendo Switch, which I have.
I don't play any real iOS games.
I'm just not a gamer and I keep trying to pretend that I am and I was like I'm not a gamer
I don't need another thing. So no, I'm gonna
Enjoy your experiences. It'll give me an excuse to visit the both of you at some point so I can play your playdate
There you go. That's a good excuse. Well, I'm just looking forward to when the stereo docks available so I can have a pen
Mm-hmm because it comes with a pen. Yeah
That's right that video that I did. I think the dock thing comes later. I believe yes
So and so I think you get I can't remember if you get the cover thing, but there's the play date
There's the cool little cover
To protect like the screen and the buttons and stuff and then there's that little dock which I mean
That's just that's part of the reason why I had to get this whole new audio interface thing
It's like and clean some of this shit off my desk so I can have room to put the little yellow dock. I
Even made a gap to great minds think alike. I shifted everything along
It's made it easier for my earphone cable and there is a spot right there could be empty months
I have a little spot right here that this is where the little box gonna go
So now I'm once all of those people at panic that are listening right now and want to send you know
Units to be reviewed and probably one of the most prestigious podcasts ever created
Across two hemispheres. I'm right. I'll go pick it up in person. Oh, we're not in person
You could leave it in an alley and tell me where it is and I'll go get it either way
I think that's a great deal. Why would panic not jump at that opportunity?
Can't think of anything. I'll even pay I'll even pay for it. Look at that
That's a deal. That's just an unbelievable deal. Yeah, panic cable sasa. We know you're listening, right? Come on
Yeah, he emails all the time to hello at hemisphere accused calm to give feedback to the show
So, I mean he's out there
[Music]
Media Corner.
Media Corner.
Media Corner.
Media Corner.
Media Corner.
The theme just keeps getting longer.
Can we do the death metal version as well?
MEDIA CORNER!
The corner in which media resides.
Well with that I'm gonna start, in case one of you two wants to go.
Please Martin, take it away.
What have you got for us in media corner?
I want to mention something which...
Yeah, go Jason, what did you want to say?
I was just gonna say I don't have a media corner today, so I'm gonna have to find something
while you're talking.
You don't have to, you can just consume other people's media.
Do you have a media alcove? Oh, okay a media nook. No
Media cranny. I guess I have a media basement, but I'm not in there right now
So that's no good to anybody that a medium basement or a media basement like an apron an apron
It's like a large media
basement
Media basement. Sorry, I don't I don't pronounce all of my letters sometimes
Except your eyes. No, I just wanted to make an English joke. You didn't do anything
Pronounce your Rs really strongly. Yes, and you're on your orange
Orange say squirrel
squirrel
What?
Speaking of orange
Like you when I was in the Apple Store today
They had an orange m1 and all the other colors on display and I couldn't pick which one to buy so I didn't I walked
Out empty-handed. So you bought all of them? No, which one would you pick though?
Like if you had to so tough really maybe the green maybe the green
But I wasn't I would have to sit there and look at them again for another 10 minutes
It was actually it was actually a very
Good thing that I when I bought this that I had to do it via
Just kind of gut feel off what I saw online if I had if I had gone into a store first
I think that would have been very difficult
Yeah paradox of choice media
corner
Again, we're back. We walked by it couldn't find it. It's that little shop that's right in the middle of the buildings
You're like where the hell is this? Oh, it's at four hundred and three and a half
Seventy second Street. Okay here. We just gotta walk through the wall with confidence and you find it
All right, I'm gonna kick it off and then we found
Media basement media nook whatever this is we found it
This isn't so much a recommendation, but just something that I wanted to shout out because it is a medium
You know, it's something that is image based and it's on Twitter
And I just thought it was one of my favorite tweets if not my favorite tweet ever
Did either of you guys see this in the show notes already?
Yes, yes, so what I don't know if this appeals to you, but it made me crack up and
Just to let everyone know I don't actually follow this person
It just turned up in my Twitter feed because someone else liked it and I had to use the Twitter for iPhone app for some reason
I don't like it, but I was there and
This person called Nadine
From what I can see she's known for tweeting in all caps and starting every tweet with F
Yeah, which may offend you I'm not gonna say the swear words
So I don't have to beep it out in the editing
And she said F. Yeah a pair of socks was abandoned in the foyer lobby for American listeners of my apartment building
So my neighbor turned them into art
Solid trolling five stars and the images that accompany this and the quoted in this tweet
Essentially what you see is this pair of discarded socks in the middle of this foyer, this hallway in the apartment building.
And someone has gone to the effort of creating a Museum of Fine Art or Contemporary Art caption, like a citation to go with it.
And I'm going to read it to you because I think this is some of the most creative, out-of-the-blue thinking for what is essentially a piece of rubbish on the floor.
Someone's forgotten socks.
And this is what it says.
In the place of the artist's name it says "unknown" with the title "Never Odd or Even 2021
Mixed Fabric on Tile" and it follows with this description "Referencing the disposable nature
of contemporary society while celebrating the ability of two souls, no matter their differences,
to find each other in the turgid spin cycle of life, palindromic Never Odd or Even imagines a
society where differences are cast aside in recognition of what binds. Two empty holes,
exhausted at peace. They are Romeo and Juliet, Bert and Ernie, ham and cheese. They are every
sock. I thought this was brilliant. I think it's fantastic. And when you hear the word palindromic,
this person really means it. The title Never Odd or Even is the same backwards as it is forwards.
Never Odd or Even backwards is never odd or even. So the amount of effort that this person in this
this Twitter users apartment building has gone to label a piece of art like this, two
socks on the floor, is unbelievable.
And as a side tangent, it reminds me of when Natasha and I were visiting, I think it was
MoMA in New York.
And this links back to what we were saying on a previous episode, Andrew, about Australian
human not quite being understood in foreign environments.
So we're standing in the middle of this, you know, big like hall in the gallery or the
museum and Natasha noticed like a pile of, it looked like dirt on the floor from someone's
shoe. So she walked up to it, bent over slightly and put her hand on like on her chin, Steve
Jobs style, observing what she was pretending was a piece of dirt art on the floor. And
the security, and I laughed and the security guard came over and said with his fine New
York accent, excuse me, madam, you know, that's not actually, and then we said, oh, we're
Australian and we're taking the piss. And he looked at us with this look of shock and
Went oh you're joking oh right anything laughed and walked off so he honestly thought that we were admiring dirt on the floor
And that's my media corner segment
I don't have anything to say other than it was a really fine piece of
Trolling past us. It'll be in the show notes if you want to see it media corner. I
Know we can't finish reading it
No, you wanted to talk about skadoogle. Well, yeah, I don't know if we probably don't have the time
So I'm just gonna side we can do that instead if you want. No, no, no, no
No, I'm gonna use this as a teaser. Okay, I watched it
Everybody talks about Ted Lasse. Oh Ted Lasse is amazing. You know what? I haven't even bothered to get around and watching
Start of season 2 yet. I love Ted Lasse, but I got time for that
That's cuz you're dead inside because I have a new love in my life and that love is
Why this thing is not getting more love? I don't understand. It is hilarious, it is enjoyable, it is sing-along joy. I love it, I love it, I love it.
Great title for a show. That's all I have to say. Just watch it, just watch it, it's so good. Give it a chance.
We love it and it's only three episodes in.
I've tried to explain to people I said, "Oh, it's like a musical comedy" and people, like
some friends of mine were just like, "Nah, we're out. Not interested."
No!
No, and I'm worried that's what people are doing. They're just going, "Musical comedy?
Nah, not for me." You've got to try this show.
I think what people need to understand is it's making fun of the format. It's a parody of
1940s musicals, so anything that shouldn't be a song is a song. It's hilarious.
Yes. It's really great. Jason, have you seen it?
I have seen it. Yes, I've seen
Two, I think I don't think the third one was out
Yet or it just came out. It's on Friday. I think right? Yeah, I think anyway
Yeah, we had seen everything up till I guess this week
Yeah, so I've seen it and you love it, right? It's
It's it's produced manugal speedy goal something like that
They haven't done themselves any favors. I'll just say that name. That's a terrible name for the show
I get that that's the name of the place and that's fine
But I think it's supposed to be like a reference to something else that no one's gonna get ever
Yeah, no one's gonna remember that name also, so that doesn't help them
for some reason they never
Talked about I didn't even know this show existed till you guys started ranting about it. So
Which is weird because every other show regardless of how good or bad it was on the platform has been like
advertised to death
but yet never heard of this until two
Seemingly random Australian people in a discord wouldn't stop talking about it. That seems really weird to me. I don't get why
It never came up anywhere. I don't know or they advertise the hell out of it in Australia not here
I guess I don't know. That's very strange. But yeah, it's not a bad show. It's fine. I'm not like
head over heels for it, but I do like saying its name incorrectly as much as possible
Yeah, I think we'll probably continue watching it though. I mean, it's it's it's funny. It's a little bit like
For me it gets to be a little bit like oh everything's his fault always and it's like, okay
Sure, it just seems a little a little bit obvious at times with the way things are going
But it's a it's an it's a fun and interesting different show
Martin I think I'm about to have a lover spat with Jason
Well look the only way to resolve that is in song go
smidugle
Corn pudding corn pudding corn pudding did somebody say corn pudding
(upbeat music)
- Hot sauce.
So hot sauce, we have talked about meat pies in the past
and ketchup or tomato sauce.
- Tomato sauce.
- Tomato sauce.
(laughing)
Talked about injections, various saucing and so forth.
A lot of saucy topics going on here.
Sauce corner time. Is hot sauce... I feel like hot sauce is kind of a...
I don't want... I mean, I guess it's like a thing in the United States. People kind of get crazy about hot sauce
and then there's like
all of the hot sauces that are
they don't taste like anything. They're just made as kind of a gimmick of "Oh, this is the hottest
four billion
gazillion schmadoogan
Scovilles or whatever which is and I always have like a chili scale on the label like that's supposed to mean something
Yeah, like okay, whatever you're you know, you want to be you want to make a YouTube video where you ate a you know a
Diamond Viper pepper or whatever
cool
I'm talking like actual hot sauce. That's good for flavor
Is that a thing in Australia where there's like our go-to hot sauce is you know?
This one or is it not really a thing and you're like, yeah
sometimes we'll put some generic like, you know Tabasco or some
insert name of
Local hot sauce there. It's hot sauce a thing there. I guess is my question and if it is what is a
Food slash meal where you'd be like this has to be eaten with hot you got up a hot sauce on it
That's just you know what you do
I'm going to jump in with the New South Welsh opinion of one person. I don't add "hot sauce"
in inverted commas to anything. I would say most people I've seen who do like to add some
form of hot sauce would generally do something like either the Tabasco that you mentioned,
or if you're at a barbecue with other people there might be some sort of, you know, they
went to the butcher and got the fancy barbecue sauce or thing that they put on the steak
or the lamb rack that they're doing on the barbecue itself to enhance the flavor.
So it's not so much "Oh I've got a steak and I'm just going to put hot sauce straight on
it" it's something that you might marinate or actually cook in.
I've come across some people who are really into adding things like hot sauce directly
onto it or having like hot beef jerky or something.
But when I think hot sauces that I like I'm normally thinking about dishes from things
like Vietnamese or Thai cuisine and the actual hot sauce of a curry or something that something's
cooked in.
personally wouldn't add a hot sauce to a dish that didn't start with it.
Okay. Over here in WA we have a bottle of the, is it sriracha?
Oh yeah, with 10 typefaces. Yeah, yeah, and it's quite funny, I remember
reading an article about that and the amount of effort and resources that are consumed
in producing that stuff for the global market. But yeah, so we have a bottle of that. The
one we have now is probably the first one we have ever bought. Like Martin, I
would never have thought to put hot sauce on anything. I don't know how we
ended up with this bottle. It just arrived one day. We have it. Gets very
occasional use. It never occurs to me to use it unless it specifically says in a
recipe or something. At this now, at this step, I would never just, you know,
voluntarily add it. Unless, and this is something I've discovered recently, I've
I've done an egg, like a fried egg.
I've discovered fried egg is good
with a bit of hot sauce on top of it.
So that's pretty much the only time
the hot sauce comes out now,
is when I've cooked some eggs.
Otherwise it sits there, yeah.
Kind of just hanging out with the other sauces,
talking sauce things.
It's lasting a long time.
- I assumed this was the case,
but I had to make sure for myself.
- Are you upset?
Bored?
What's the reaction from the Northern Custy?
It's it's one of those things that I just feel is it feels like an American thing which I know it's not
Yes, but it feels like it is where?
there's you know, the hot sauce they give you going if you went into a
Supermarket here
right verse a
Woolies, let's say the pressure people not not a sponsor yet
Oh, so wait, will is Woolies the one that does the radio thing?
That's calls calls. Okay. So why is our podcast not playing at Coles is my question first of all
That should be a thing. Well, if you want to be put up next to advertisements about chicken then sure
Yeah, I'm fine with that down down the podcast is down
So if I went into a supermarket here, right there would be an entire wall
of an aisle probably of hot sauces just different brands and types and all kinds
of stuff and I feel like you're there you're gonna have like Tabasco sauce in
the corner from like 1987 that no one ever buys and then maybe like one bottle
of sriracha or something mm-hmm that just seems like a distinct yeah two
things number one that proves that it's an American thing because we don't have
walls of hot sauce here, Andrew, right? We don't? No, I've never walked past a wall of hot sauce.
Yeah, there you go. Number two, talking about coals for a second, this is something that I
find hilarious about the categorization of food in aisles, at least in cold supermarkets in
Australia. If you look across all the aisles that contain food, you're going to have quite an
international representation, right? You're going to have some Mexican, you're going to have maybe
some Asian foods, maybe some Vietnamese sauces, you know, you're going to find different stuff.
And then there's the section within one of the food aisles that is labeled "international".
And you think, "Well, where the hell is the rest of the food from? I don't know."
And then you see weird things in there that I think are just categorized as such because
they had to be shipped in specially or they have labels like "luncheon meat",
which I don't think anyone would actually eat.
Do you have international food sections within the rest of the internationally-themed supermarket
food? No, usually there'll be a section for various other countries, but that's
I think probably where it would end. I have to say, shopping grocery stores in
America were a massive disappointment for me when I went there. I
expected them to be like kind of like an amazing miracle of the modern world.
They're really disappointing. It's just by aisles and aisles of packaged food and then those same things with the cinnamon version
That's basically it. Yeah, I was very puzzled by Trader Joe's to be honest. Oh the best
Well when I first heard what it was, I thought it was a hardware shop
I didn't know it was a grocery shop. Yeah, I got there and then it was full of food
I was like, oh, this is a not what I imagined
Trader yeah, they're they're fantastic. Did you go there Andrew? I don't think I made it to try to chose
I went to the other fancy one our Whole Foods. Yeah before it was before it was an Amazon company
Yeah, yeah, and it was it Whole Foods just looked like that was the closest thing to an Australian
Grocery store that I found but it just seemed like everything was overpriced
I was like, well, this is just normal stuff with a huge markup
But it wasn't normal in the context of other American grocery stores
I could see why it was a big thing, but it seemed pretty normal to me as an Australian
Yeah, so I think you guys might be in a little bit screwed on the grocery store situation
Yeah, I mean my go-to's would be Trader Joe's and then we have one here called New Seasons Market, which is
Probably the best grocery store I've ever been to they just it's great. They've got everything and it's very
It's like I think it's local. I'm not really sure. I don't think they're like international or anything
But yeah, they've got a lot of variety, every kind of version of everything you could want.
Well, if and when you make it to Australia, I'd love to know what you think of ours.
I love going to grocery stores in other countries. It's one of my top visited spots. Convenience
stores, depending on the country as well, to kind of see what that's like. And any kind of
all-purpose type store where they kind of just have
everything
Because I'm always interested to see
What different countries think are important types of stores to have and like how many of them are specialty?
We only have this verse we have one store that just has everything because nothing's really important enough to have its own
Dedicated store. We just kind of throw it all in the one store. I find that interesting
I was just gonna say I think the thing that we benefit from in terms of our grocery stores is that because we're a
multicultural nation
There is a default setting that you're going to get a bit of everything
yeah, it's not because you've got to cater to the the Indian families and the the Asian families and the
Anglo families, you know who all want different stuff. So basically every store will have all of that stuff
Yeah, and it's just it's a default setting
So it it's really high level of variety
Everywhere and is interesting where that influence comes from
I would say it's the same here depending on where you are
Right, like if you're in the middle of the United States where it's pretty much all the same thing
It's gonna be different than if you're on, you know
on one of the kind of more
Culturally diverse places around the US. I think it's gonna be very specific. Also if it's just you know generic safe way
They're all pretty much the same. They might have a few different things here or there
But it's more the kind of regionally specific stores that are gonna have those
Regionally specific items right? You know where I really want a different here versus the mid like Midwest or something
Hmm. I really want to go to cloud 9 superstore
cloud 9
What's cloud 9 sometimes? I try and be funny and it just bombs. I don't know. Oh, is that the show the show?
Yes, oh it just clicked the show Superstore. I was like, what are you talking about?
No Superstore was the name of the show. I tell you what if you guys are up with your cultural references
That would have been hilarious. There's people in the audience right now laughing. They're dying. They love it. They want more
What is this another show on Apple TV that no one knows about or what what's going on here? What is this one?
I think that's a pretty normal one. I think it's on Netflix. I think it's also on my Plex server
Netflix is Netflix. That's the gaming thing, right? That's the one that does all the games now
Another reference no one gets perfect
This is awesome
*laughter*
