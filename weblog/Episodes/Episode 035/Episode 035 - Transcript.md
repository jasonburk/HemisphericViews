purple purple squirrel squirrel squirrel squirrel
Squirrel, how do you say it squirrel squirrel?
Come on swirl or twirl like the chocolate bar kind of
Squirrel do you have twirls over there? That's a Cadbury thing 12 12 12
What's the difference in the twirl and a flake really if you break it down?
I think a twirl is a flake encased
Encased in what?
Chocolate.
It's itself, so that it doesn't flake onto you.
You have a Cadbury flake over there?
Is it like a fourth dimensional kind of thing?
So the flake is like Cadbury dairy milk milk chocolate to use the copyrighted term, and
it's all flaky, right?
And you eat it and it drops on you.
But the twirl I think is the flake with a coating of non-flaky Cadbury dairy milk milk
chocolate so that you can eat the twirl and then maybe only a little bit goes on your
shirt.
Wait, you just said milk milk chocolate.
It's dairy milk milk chocolate.
How does that written though?
I mean, is it like dairy?
So it's like Cadbury and then dairy milk with like the registered or copyright or trademark thing and then milk chocolate as the actual general product.
Milk milk chocolate.
That's because it's milk milk because every every book every block comes with a glass and a half full cream dairy milk.
Exactly.
Wow.
Just like that.
Huh?
And that's an ad right back from the 80s probably before Martin was born.
That's and a half no, they still use that a glass and a half
Yeah, but you remember the old do you remember the old scientist guy that had the famous scientist guy?
Maybe not. Maybe it is before my time. He did the experiments with the kids. I
Think that's illegal
And you get 400 milliliters of milk if you liquefy the children you get a glass on a half, so what you're saying? Yeah
It's kind of like our version of the colonel the KFC colonel
Was it dr. Julius was it some no no Julius some no no no
Julius Caesar, I think is here thinking okay?
That's a YouTube research project right there, but you watch it and the guy says only a glass and a half full cream dairy milk
every block
Cadbury's chocolate full cream dairy milk though is not milk right I mean full cream would be
Cream.
Yeah.
They just want to say the fact that there's dairy in it.
So it's slightly convinced you that there's calcium in the truck.
It's not just complete garbage in there.
Oh wait, it's four 59.
Okay.
Well, what if we just kept going for like an hour?
Yeah.
Forgot to even do it.
That'd be so good.
Start whenever you like.
Um, all right.
I'm going to, okay.
It's fun.
Oh, wow.
Everything's making noise.
Cause it's five o'clock.
Love it.
It's on.
Wow.
It's on.
It is on.
Is it working though?
We don't know.
Could be.
Maybe someone's hearing this.
Maybe they're not.
- Good question.
- I'm not seeing anything yet.
Oh, there it is.
Okay.
- This is pretty exciting.
- Yeah, wow.
Have you ever done anything live?
I haven't.
- No.
- My whole life has been live so far,
but not in a performance context.
- No, mine's all pre-recorded.
- Hey, do you guys, do you guys want to hear a joke?
- Yes, absolutely.
- I'd love to hear a joke, yeah.
- Okay.
Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
(upbeat music)
- Hello and welcome to Hemispheric Views Live
from micro.camp.
This is pretty exciting guys, what do you reckon?
- It's exciting.
- I mean, if anything's a joke, it's us.
So I totally agree with that joke.
(both laughing)
Well, look, I'm absolutely thrilled to be here
with my co-hosts, Andrew Canyon and Jason Bourque.
We're absolutely thrilled to be live participants
at micro.camp.
Micro.blog, after all,
was where really Hemispheric Views started.
I think we met each other here.
We started gas bagging, talking rubbish,
and now people actually spend their time subscribing
and listening to that rubbish in their podcast app.
So thank you everyone for joining us.
I think we should do a little bit of a time check though,
'cause it's a bit weird.
Jason, what time is it where you are?
- It's so strange.
It is 5 p.m. in Portland, Oregon right now
when normally it is 4 a.m. for me when we're doing this.
So it's very strange.
- You're very awake.
You look very energetic, fresh.
- I'm ready to go.
It's live.
- How about you, Andrew?
- Yeah, I'm almost got the Jason effect.
It is 8.02 a.m. in gloomy Perth, Western Australia.
Had to set the alarm to make sure I didn't oversleep.
But I'm ready to go now.
I'm good to go.
Got my glass of water.
I've had my cup of tea.
- I love how it doesn't matter when we record,
he always seems to have like an okay time,
regardless of when we do this.
- It's perfect.
Come on guys.
- Center of the world.
And look here in Wollongong,
it's actually beautiful, bright and sunny,
but I have to say it's fraught with danger
whenever I record or do anything in the day,
because at any given time,
you could hear cockatoos or rainbow lorikeets
screeching outside.
You could hear my neighbors upstairs
doing tap dancing and stilettos on wooden floorboards.
You could hear a toilet flushing upstairs.
You could hear a baby crying.
So I apologize to everyone.
It's a bit crazy during the day here in Wollongong.
But moving to our topics.
- No, no, no, it is not okay.
- Oh, it's already been interrupted.
- That's right.
Come on, Martin, par for the course.
Look, I need to point out that in our recording schedule,
the last one that went out to our feed was episode 34.
And I was thinking about this in the shower last night.
And I was thinking, next one, episode 35,
that's the micro block.
No, hang on.
It's not episode 35.
This is episode 30 live.
Man.
Oh, well done.
Just raise itself.
So, yeah, that's the official the official nomenclature of this episode now is episode 30 live.
How long did you spend in the shower to actually come up with that?
Oh, it's probably 45 minutes at least.
It's going to say your hair's glistening.
That makes sense.
The hot water ran out, you know, it was like, oh, no, but the bright idea hadn't arrived yet.
So I had to keep pushing through.
Good on you.
So your whole family suffered through cold showers last night for that joke.
I hope everyone listening is appreciative of that.
Okay. So moving to our topic today, we thought we would talk about something really predictable,
but, you know, who knows where it goes?
Because we don't plan these things, really.
We're here because of micro.blog.
Micro.camp is the event.
So blogging brought us here.
But when we thought about blogging, there's so much that comes to mind, you know, public versus private, how we decide to use our blogs.
How does it differ between what's written?
What's audio?
What's video?
What does it really mean to blog these days?
So I think we were going to start, Jason, you had a particular suggestion
about using a blog publicly.
Do you want to kick us off with that?
I would love to.
Yeah.
Um, there's been, so for the people that are in a time zone similar to yours,
there's been a good bit of talk throughout the day today about blogging by various
people during micro camp.
And you can actually see those videos within the interface.
You're listening to this right now at any time, and those will be available for a
while, but something that I have been thinking about in terms of my personal
blog is using it not only as a public repository, but kind of a reference
material section as well, not only for myself, but for others.
When you look at things like typical social networks day to day, they're
very, it's here and then it's gone.
And then it's here and then it's gone.
They're kind of searchable, but not really.
and they're really more meant for hard hitting, fast,
you know, hot takes on whatever.
But I like to think of my blog or just blogs in general
as more of a kind of like archive.org kind of thing, right?
Where this information is meant to live on
for not just the next five minutes or next five weeks,
but really forever.
So I've tended to start using my personal blog as just that
for myself and for others.
So sometimes I use it in a selfish standpoint
where I will actually document something very thoroughly.
Like for instance, like the YouTube DL stuff
that I keep updated constantly.
I use that as an excuse to make myself
annotate all that stuff down
so that I have a way to get back to it later.
And I use the excuse to myself
that this is gonna be useful for other people too.
So it kind of forces me into documenting it really well.
I have to think this is kind of like when people write code
that some people write really good comments,
some people write really bad comments
and some just don't comment at all.
So I like to think of this as my commenting to the public
of my quote source code that I write.
- Well, I've appreciated that post,
even if nobody else has, I refer to it.
- Quite regularly, whenever my setup breaks,
I'm like, oh no, where's that bookmark?
Yeah, I similarly with my blog, why do I write a blog?
Why do I run two blogs?
That's another question.
But my primary motivation is actually to find other souls.
I think it's probably if I boil it all down, I'm looking for some kind of connection, I
guess.
And that's been the greatest thing about the micro.blog service is that you do get that.
There's sort of a built-in network of other people.
you feel like you aren't just firing stuff into the void.
So that is one of my primary reasons for why I do it.
Like Jason, I like to sort of feel like
I'm helping build the hive mind,
'cause how many times do you Google stuff,
you're trying to figure out something or work something,
how to do something and you find a blog?
Unfortunately, that's less now
because it tends to be like
everybody just puts stuff on YouTube,
which is kind of annoying,
not really how I want to figure things out.
I wanna read a blog and learn.
I don't wanna watch a guy saying,
Hey guys, thanks for joining me on this YouTube video.
I like that you put an American accent on there.
Oh, they're the worst, right?
Americans, oh goodness.
I think most of our listening audience is probably in the Northern Hemisphere though,
so don't shoot us in the foot.
Watch the disconnections happen.
I'm definitely not blogging for money or stats, and if I were, I'm doing it really badly because
I'm not running any ads and I'm not running...
I think I've got one stat tracker on Blot, I think because I turned it on when I signed
up and I've never turned off but I've never looked at it.
So I'm not doing, I have no idea if anybody ever looks at my blog other than the microblog
comments.
It's just to have a, put a flag in the turf and say I exist.
The YouTube thing is huge because it's, you always find videos of stuff, but then it's
so damn hard to actually get to the part you're looking for.
Whereas in an article, it's command F or Windows key F or whatever, and you can just search
for it.
But yeah, the video thing is super annoying.
Videos are great, but they don't always have what they want.
And you have to remember that all these videos are meant to serve the algorithm.
So whatever the keywords are or any of the metadata crap, it might not actually be in
But it's more just meant to make sure that video monetizes well, so
Yeah, the blog text its text so if it's not in there it won't be found which I find to be very nice
At this point I can't help but take the piss out of Andrew a little bit before you started blogging publicly Andrew was your journaling
Or blogging taking place in spreadsheet cells
No, no
I've been blogging it feels like I've been blogging forever like I had a movable type blog and all that kind of stuff
Spreadsheet cells of a calculations all right if you can't recalc on them
It's not it's not an appropriate use of a spreadsheet
But surely there's some really interesting data in there Andrew about you know the number of blog posts going up and the average and the average
Number of characters across them. There's a lot of stuff that you could be finding out here actually that's a good point
So I thought so I want to do something. I actually wanted okay. Can we get Manton onto that?
Can we get some data extraction tools?
No, no, no.
Don't put it on to man to know this is your responsibility.
Wait a second.
Wait, actually.
Hold on.
Unannounced trivia corner.
I knew you would do this.
Yes.
Unannounced trivia corner comes to you live and this could not be a better tie in question one.
Damn it.
How many posts does Andrew currently have on micro dot blog?
He's actually looked into it.
Jeez.
Andrew, you have to go first.
It's about you.
Is it a multiple choice or is it just a raw number?
Well, I was going to let you banter and then I was going to have you, you guess, uh, your, your choices are.
1,205, 806, 1,683 or 2,408.
Wow.
You first Andrew.
Well, I guess I have to go first.
Um, I'm going to go 806.
Okay.
I'm not that.
- You are locked in?
- I think he's underestimated.
I'm going for C.
- Okay.
Good choices.
Question number two.
How many backers did the original
micro.blog Kickstarter have way back in 2017?
Can you believe it's been since 2017 already?
It's crazy.
Your answers are 1,375,
3,080,
2,785,
or 4,298.
- I'm gonna jump in and say the one with 4,000.
The last one there.
I reckon there was a lot of support.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna say 2,785.
- Excellent, your answers are locked in.
And thank you for playing Unannounced Trivia Corner.
- Now are you continuing?
All this unexpected tomfoolery.
Are you actually gonna ever share the answers
or are you gonna leave our listeners
completely disappointed?
- So I think the next thing
we should probably talk about in terms of blogging is the fact that blogging can be
very fickle. And the funny thing about blogging is that oftentimes, and I'm guilty of this
myself, changing blogging platforms tends to become more of the actual use of a blog
than the actual writing of content within it. And I'm not trying to shame anyone when
I say this because I've done this over and over and over.
But I think it's interesting that so many people when we talk about blogging want to,
we want to blog more, we talk about blogging more, and then we don't and we instead like
fiddle with a MySQL database for five days or something.
So for me, the micro.blog connection to my actual blog helps that in the sense that I
I don't have to feel this pressure that I think a lot of people do of if it's not a
ton of words or formatted perfectly or this, you know, masterpiece of writing that I'm,
it's never going to happen.
I can just put stuff in 280 characters and it's still kind of somewhat related to my
main blog.
So I'm, I, I'm assuming both of you have changed blogging platforms over the years.
I'm going to guess Martin probably got set up one and then never changed it because he
just uses the same stuff always.
I know and it was default.
Yeah.
He's probably still using I web or something, but, um,
Oh, how did you know?
I'm, I'm wondering how many times you've changed and if you have felt like by
changing you somehow accomplished your blogging, you know, want Andrew,
you go,
I was going to say, no, no, no, no.
I was going to say, we should actually, we should actually completely switch,
you know,
podcasting platforms right now,
mid show just to see what happens and let's tinker with it and let's see if all
the listeners make it over to the new feed.
I reckon we could do it.
I'm working on it now.
Anyway, you go first Andrew.
Oh, okay.
Well, I've been on, I mentioned earlier, I was on MovableType way back when, and then
I did the WordPress thing for a while.
I had a blogger, that was a thing.
So I've been through all the platforms.
This is probably the most stable I've ever been in terms of blogging platforms.
I feel wonderful that I don't have WordPress in my life.
I don't have to think about plugins.
That's the cool thing about like you said micro.blog, it's just there, it just works.
I like the fact it's so easy to get stuff in.
I use MarsEdit or I can use the MicroBlog app or I can use Gluon, I can use Drafts.
There's so many ways, browser extensions, there's so many ways to get stuff into it
and it's all really easy, which I love.
And then I have Blot on the other side of the equation, which I set up because I was
intrigued in the methodology rather than needing another vlog.
Funny.
And that's actually a bit of a... you've got to futz around to get stuff into it, which
is not actually the value proposition for Blot.
The idea is that you write something, you save it in Dropbox, and it's a text file in
Dropbox and it goes on your website.
Of course I overcomplicate that because I don't want Dropbox running on my machine.
So then I have to use Git and suddenly you're doing version management and version control
on your computer and doing diffs and I'm writing like when I just want to post a blog and I'm
having to like write code notes as to why I'm pushing this change and it's like this
is all ridiculous.
So it's this huge level of friction that prevents me from actually blogging there very much
but I still like that.
kind of like the fun, techy, nerdy side of it all. So it exists to satisfy that itch.
But on a day-to-day basis, if I just want to shove something up, it's micro.blog. And
I don't really see that changing now. I think I've settled into a steady state.
Sorry, shove something up where, Andrew?
On the internet.
Oh, good. Okay.
Not in a shoebox app. I don't need to shove it into a Yojimbo database at this point in
time.
That's a really we do not have the the buzzer bleeper for live. So that's
Mostly I'm trying to remind myself of that. Oh we do. Oh, no, there it is. It just takes a minute
It just doesn't sync with anything
So I'll jump in for this one. You're absolutely right that I tend to be mr. Default with everything not because I'm lazy or uninterested
It's just you know what?
I've thought about it. I've chosen what I want and I'm gonna stick with it because I want that stability of writing
I think our motivations are a bit different.
People who've listened to this show before know that different things make us tick.
I love the act of writing in general.
So once the platform's chosen, unless something absolutely collapses or isn't working,
it's like, you know, I'm happy with this.
And I've kind of I think I even said this a while ago when I spoke to Jean on Micro Monday.
The thing that I loved about micro.blog and the reason why I've stuck with it alongside a totally different account for WordPress with a different site is that it enables me to do different things on each platform.
WordPress just kind of continues the extended writing that I did when I
started that account at university because they said, "You know what? You're
in a communications course. Everyone needs a blog." You know, this is when
everyone was still kind of hopeful and utopian about that old world, I suppose
you can say. "This is how you will, you know, get jobs and do things." And so I
kind of chugged along doing that. But then micro.blog entered my life and I
went, "Wow, there's a kind of versatility or lightness to this." You know, and I get
on there and I never feel the need of changing or tinkering or moving away because it's like,
"Oh, these people are using it for like Instagram photo sharing or this person's using it to do a
microcast or this person's doing it for extended writing or sharing or connecting to their other
blog." So there never really seems to be much pressure to change or be a certain type of
personal micro.blog because it's kind of that, you know, WordPress meets Twitter meets Instagram,
but ad-free and everyone can just kind of be themselves. So that's why I stay and that's
That's why I love it so much.
And you know, you can meet people like you too.
So I've, I've never really had that drive to change or tinker with things or leave
in that kind of sense.
It's, it's hard to talk about micro dot blog and not have some of the other stuff or
other services rather come up in that conversation, right?
Like your Twitters and your Facebooks and your whatever the heck else there is.
This moment.
I'm wondering now, because we were talking about this earlier during micro camp of micro.blog
kind of being blog first, which is kind of obvious since it's in the name, blog is there,
right?
But I'm curious how, if you guys think about, or when you maybe tell someone else about
it, do you approach it as being more of a timeline-based micro-posty type thing or a
blogging platform that also has the kind of micro post stuff.
Cause they're, they're kind of the same thing,
but I think depending on which door you enter through,
it can be a very different conversation.
So I don't know if,
if that has ever come up for either of you, maybe Martin,
go ahead.
- Most of the people I talk to about it,
aren't really part of the blogging or tech enthusiast world.
So I introduce it to them fairly differently.
So I just brought up then, for example,
the words Instagram and Twitter.
So I say to them, you know, Instagram and Twitter, and they say, yeah,
and they look kind of worried. And I say, you know,
all the stuff that you don't like about that,
how things aren't in order and stories are leaping out at you and it's all just
messy and you've got ads and stuff. And I go, yeah. And I say,
imagine all the best things about short posts,
if you want to do it that way and photos, right.
Without any of that crap in it. And I go, Oh, and I say,
so it's this beautiful world that doesn't have this algorithmic pressure on you.
And that's the thing sometimes,
And this might sound like a weird way to put it
because everything's generally about engagement these days.
But sometimes I find myself using micro.blog less
because the pressure's not on me to jump and check on it
every five minutes.
I can go in with purpose and focus and intention,
engage with people.
I might not be back for a week,
but it's not eating away at me,
making me feel bad about my involvement.
So I try to sell it to people as a place
where you can go in and make genuine connections.
And I try not to focus too much
the extended writing part because not everyone's into that. That's super interesting. I've noticed
that as well where previously on other platforms, like if you were gone for that five minutes,
you're nobody now. Like, who are you? You, you're completely forgotten. We're now, I, I can go to
sleep, wake up the next day and it's totally fine. Nothing happened that was horrible for me.
And I might get a reply to something that I posted eight months ago.
And it's like, it doesn't matter.
It's, it's not like, oh, why are you replying to something that's super old?
It's like, oh, cool.
They found something that I said eight months ago and continue the conversation.
It's just, it's such a, it's real time, but it doesn't have to be, which is, it's
very unique in that respect, I find.
I don't think there's anything else like that, that comes to mind for me.
So this um, so micro blog sort of got joined the dots between us three and it's led to
not blogging but an audio production. Of course micro blog has many features, yes you can also
run a podcast through it, but really writing on a blog and recording a podcast where you're speaking
contemporaneously is to extemporaneously sorry get my words right is um that was for martin
is uh it's really important so much yeah you know i'll hear about it later if i didn't but
they're so different but how do you guys how do you guys find the two like do you have a preference
or you know because i'm finding this whole experience to be quite fun but they're very
different things what do you guys reckon about writing versus blog um writing versus podcasting
Well, I'll jump in here. Writing, I absolutely love writing. And it's a very, I mean, people
do it differently. But for me, it's a very personal smash the words out on the page. And
it's really an example of trying to get your own introspective thoughts out in some way that you
can either keep for yourself in a journal, or share out in the public open world as we started
with our first subtopic, podcasting, especially with YouTube guys. And then when it builds out
into a community of people like we have on discord, in our public discord or on micro.blog,
you realize that through that act of conversation, like what we're doing right now,
it's a very shared experience. I can't just take over the whole show. Jason can't do it.
Andrew can't do it. We have to share. So we're kind of co-creating this participatory space,
which then ends up bleeding into and connecting this broader ecosystem of micro-blog posts or
chats in a group. So there is a distinction of sharing the experience, but it ends up connecting
to the very writing that started the whole thing in the first place.
And then it wraps back on itself with hemispheric news, right? Because we do the newsletter,
which is then kind of blog posty in itself, and then we talk over each other, which is you can't
do in writing, so that's nice. No, I was going to say, wasn't Martin's
answer the answer of somebody who's writing a PhD doctorate in this stuff? Like, wow.
Thank you, doctor. Could be. Let's hope I finish it,
otherwise you're just going to hear me banging on podcasts about this for all time with no actual
conclusion. That's great. Yeah, so I just think the audio enables you to be much more intimate
with people. I've obviously made two friendships with you guys, but you know, the fact that
it now involves people who are now contributing to this chat, it's great to see some familiar
names in the actual micro camp site chat right now. And that's an example of writing, right?
They're writing their own thoughts and putting it on a site, but they're sharing with other
people and we're audio recording live but we're acknowledging what was written
so everything just kind of bleeds into this soup of communication and that's
what I think is really exciting about this. I find that writing, writing has
always come easily to me. I'm not one that feels the need really to write
outline especially for blog post link stuff I don't need to outline and plan I
can just write a few paragraphs it's pretty straightforward but it
It comes with very little enjoyment for me.
Very rarely do I enjoy the process of writing, even though I don't really struggle with it.
But speaking, I find that much harder.
But it's quite thrilling.
There's a much greater level of enjoyment in doing this, even though it's more challenging
in some ways than writing a blog post.
And the great thing about doing a podcast, you can always edit it.
that it is a lot more cumbersome to edit a podcast
than a blog post.
It's just interesting the two forms.
But what do I love more?
I definitely love doing the podcast stuff more,
even though I would consider myself
to be an introverted person
who should be squirreled up behind his keyboard.
It's a strange thing.
- Well, we discovered that on a previous episode, didn't we?
For anyone who listened in the past, thank you very much.
We actually did a full business-style personality test
that you recommended, Andrew,
And it's amazing just how different along that introversion,
extroversion spectrum we were.
I did not know that I would explode that far beyond both of you on the E side.
Cause you both, I mean, that's the thing you both come across as, you know,
very, I suppose, extroverted speakers on this, but yeah,
maybe you do feel more comfortable with the writing.
What do you reckon about all this, Jason?
The only problem with podcasting that I'm finding in terms of that verse writing
is a little bit of the YouTube issue that we talked about before,
that you have the density of information that's packed into a podcast is just so
much greater than in a post on the web and kind of by design, right?
I think you want to write a post that's meaningful, but at the same time, you
don't want every blog post to be 72 million words, right?
Because certain people will always read every 72 million word post, but the vast
majority of people won't.
And a podcast kind of feels like that, where if it's an hour or whatever,
There's a lot of information in there that's not super readily
available or easy to access.
So I think something like show notes is a great thing.
I think I personally love shows that have very, very detailed show notes so that
you can either look at it while you're listening, or maybe you just want to skim
through and see what that episode is to see if it's really something you need to
be doing right now or want to listen to.
Um, I'll be the first to admit, I don't think every episode of every
podcast needs to be listened to.
That's just the way it is.
depending on the show.
I mean, if it's an episodic show, sure.
But if it's informational,
maybe you only need certain chapters
or certain parts of it.
So to have a detailed outline show notes of each episode,
I think is super important.
But even past that,
I really think a lot of these podcasts/services
need to enable things like full text transcripts
so that they're more accessible by more people.
Because maybe you're in a scenario
where you're looking for a piece of information
and it's in that podcast,
but I can't get to it without listening to, you know,
14 minutes of audio where if I were in an environment
where I could just skim some text, that would be better.
So I think the accessibility of podcasts
maybe needs to get a little bit better.
But overall, I think I do prefer the podcast thing,
even though it's, or I should say the edited podcast thing.
I don't know about the live portion so much
because you can't edit it,
but the edited podcast just feels like
when we do a show every other week, it's usually, I don't know,
anywhere between 45 minutes to like three hours. It's, it can be anything.
And then it gets edited down to this nice crisp 44 minute thing every other
week. And it's just,
I think a really nice way to package up information to be consumed by others.
That being said, I mean,
I'm loving seeing comments pop up in this feed here on the micro camp site.
This is the kind of feedback we don't normally get in written form while we're doing our recordings.
So this comes to a point that I think one of you added to our little topic pool here.
Comments on or off.
What do you think about that?
Yes. Do you want me to?
I will. I will go first.
You talked about stats earlier, Andrew, and I don't have any stats on my blog.
I know for a fact I read it more than anyone else.
That's a given.
There's no way.
Except the YouTube DL post.
I reckon I'm beating you on that one.
Maybe.
So yeah, no stats.
And then comments I have off, which I have mixed feelings about.
I have them off mostly because I don't see there to be a good technical way for me to
do it with my current setup that I'm happy with.
It's kind of a bolt-on hacky, ugly crap fest in terms of comments.
Spam sucks.
I don't want someone else to come to something that I've handcrafted the way I want it to
look and then have it be bombarded with a bunch of BS at the bottom that's probably
not relevant and probably just ads for, you know, insert your pill of choice that they're
trying to push on you.
So I generally leave all that stuff off.
I like, I guess in a perfect world I would love to have, and yes I know this is possible
with the IndieWeb stuff and I haven't gotten to it yet.
But to have this web mention type thing
somehow play back into where when I post a blog post
to micro.blog, those comments maybe are included,
but I still don't know.
I think I'm still on the 50% side of,
I just don't want comments on my, you know,
Berk.io page.
If they want to exist separately on micro.blog, totally fine.
I'm happy to have a conversation there about it.
But I just don't know if I'm ready to accept
all this other stuff happening there for me personally.
I don't know.
I'm conflicted.
I go back and forth on it.
Currently, I track nothing and I have no kind of feedback
on my actual blog itself
other than micro.blog separately.
- I have mine too.
I have comments turned on
And it's probably because it's such a small, rarely visited site that it kind of doesn't matter.
And the comments you do get are generally civil.
And I can point to it and say, "Look, mum, look, people do read my stuff."
And your mum is involved, actually, very well.
Yeah, I know, you've got to watch out for mum.
She's quick to call me out on things.
I don't mind on bigger sites, you know, on the, as soon as you get to the New York times
sort of stuff, get rid of comments on that because everybody's just pushing their own
barrow like they're not there to actually have a conversation.
They're there to make noise and it's, it becomes a Facebook page immediately.
So I think for indie sites, I don't mind having comments on, but not for big ones.
Yeah.
And comments serve different purposes on different sites, don't they?
Cause I don't really have comments on the blog that I keep on WordPress.
I love the fact that the replies work so well on micro.blog for the comment, for the functionality
there.
But podcasts, like you were saying before, Andrew, that difference between writing and
audio, we accept a whole heap of comments in that sense.
It's not attached to the audio necessarily, but when you consider micro.blog and the hemispheric
views presence we have there, Twitter, Discord, etc., even the comment thing that I just pointed
out here on the micro camp site that we're looking at now, really podcasts and audio
feed off that commentary because you want to know what people actually thought of what you had to say.
So I think in the audio realm, comments actually serve an even nicer purpose because that's the communication that you open up with listeners and friends online.
It seems a lot more enriching than the comments that you see on a news site or something like that.
Yeah. And I guess some podcasts, I mean, they spend half their each episode with follow up talking about the comments that they've received from between the last show and this show, you know, so it becomes self-referential.
That's a way to put it one slight correction
I guess I do have a public email address on there and I have that because I am
I am genuinely interested in what people's original thoughts are about
Anything that I've done but not necessarily after having read
15 or 16 other opinions and then trying to form their own opinion after they've already been kind of
Deluded by what they've just read by 15 or 16 other people
So I kind of feel like I would rather them just say, you know what?
I have a strong opinion about what you just said.
Click, send me an email and, and, and send it to me.
I think I prefer that currently in the way things work.
It's almost like I would rather have it be leave a comment and
then comments unlock or something.
I don't know.
It's a weird thing.
And I think maybe it's a lot from the past being just negatively impacted by
comments for so many years that you just shun away from it entirely, being that it is the
internet and it's mostly a horrific place with a few kind of shining lights here or there. So I
think that might be part of why comments are just instantly a no, but maybe it's time to reassess.
Now, I reckon we've very nicely wrapped up the world of blog posts and why we use these
different services. Now, honestly, everyone listening, we did not expect an Unannounced
Trivia Corner before. That was a nice surprise for all of us. One task that we did set for Jason,
Jason went towards his microphone to shock me with something else, but I'm going to keep going.
We did set a task for Jason to come up with some form of conversational question for we
Southern Hemispherians, right? I don't know what he's decided to ask us. But if you've listened to
previous episodes, he's asked us about anything to do with meat pies through to attitudes
on hot sauce and we've discussed footwear, which was a very controversial conversation.
Jason, what do you what have you actually decided to ask today?
Have you both heard the good word about one prime plot? No, I'm kidding. I'm not actually
moving on. Not really. The only one I came up with for today was our so in Australia,
you both reside, both on the East and the West. Is it a thing for people to bring
pets around with them, usually smaller hand-holdable type pets around as it were
an accessory type of deal/just bringing it into stores regardless of what the
store's policy is? As just, do people have pets as kind of an accessory versus
a pet? Is that a thing there?
Now just to be clear because you've used the word accessory there, you're talking about
live pets that will actually maybe do a poop or something, not digital pets like Australia
just caught up with the Tamagotchis.
No, no, no, no, no.
I think Tamagotchis are still legal there, I believe.
They're not on the endangered list in Australia yet.
Yeah, a small dog perhaps, or maybe there you might have a wallaby, or maybe a tiny
kangaroo on a leash, something like that.
That would be a quokka.
Oh, a quokka.
I love a quokka.
Oh, they're always so smiley.
Yeah, I'm happy to take this one first, unless you want to, Andrew.
No, go ahead.
This is...
All right, I'll jump in.
Coming to mine, I'll tell you, maybe it's because I live in more of a regional city.
I mean, Wollongong is a...
It's a city.
It's classed as such, but it's not really Sydney or Melbourne.
I don't really see people carrying pets around with them, particularly into shops or different
businesses.
I think if I were to say that I'd be a little bit puzzled, to be honest.
You actually have reminded me though that when Natasha and I visited the US when unrestricted
international travel was still a thing, what's all that about?
I remember we were actually in a pharmacy in San Francisco and this really, really,
I want to say, dressed up, it was almost like a formal event.
This woman walked into the pharmacy and she had, I think it was a Chihuahua on a lead
wearing a bright red puffer jacket. And we just stopped and went, "What on earth have we just seen?"
Because it wasn't like the handbag thing or, you know, carrying it around. This dog was as equally
dressed up as her for this American winter. And we went, "Well, now we've seen everything." But
then now you've made me actually think, while we didn't go into shops with a pet, our beloved,
now has left us, white guinea pig, Parco, who we love very dearly, we actually used to get some
strange looks because we would take him out in this little travel harness thing that he hated,
like on the lawn near the beach in Wollongong, and we'd sit there with hot chips or our coffee,
and people would walk past and do this double take thinking, "What the hell is that?" And then
they'd work out it was this fluffy little rodent parka, and come over and say, "Is that a guinea
pig?" And we'd say, "Yeah, do you want to pet him?" And they're like, "Oh my goodness, yes,
thank you." And they'd come and pet our guinea pig by the beach. So we'd never take a pet into
a shop, but we did take a guinea pig out like it was a dog.
Okay, fair. Yeah, I think that was my follow-up question for you, Martin, was that when you
were here and we met up in the Bay Area, I'm sure you would have come across this. So I
figured that this would have been a thing for you when you were here.
Yeah, absolutely. And it was a thrilling showcase of American culture.
What about WA? I feel like WA is a little more on the having small dogs in stores, but
maybe not.
I don't think so. I think... I don't know if there's... there's probably bylaws restricting
it. That would be my initial sort of presumption that there's got to be a law against this
kind of thing. Because I know there's a lot of exemptions for guide dogs.
Sure.
have to specifically exempt guide dogs from other laws.
This is strictly a non-useful pet, but a just a regular pet.
Generally and this is probably some of my own biases coming through here, but generally
I think most people certainly are, if you took a dog into a shop, you'd get looked at
and you'd be like, "Come on, mate.
Get real."
And if it's smaller than a cat, it's not really a dog anyway, so get a real pet.
You know, you've got to take that sort of Australian approach to it.
Oh no, look, it's Australia, right?
So what you'll find is you'll find dogs left outside.
You've gone for a walk and you tie your dog up outside and people come in and out and they'll say, "Oh, g'day mate," and give the dog a little pat.
And depending on the kids congregating around the dog and it's very sweet
We say that all the time down the road at the front of our grocery shop
Yeah, so that's more the approach
But if you take that same said dog into the store suddenly it turns from a cute little puppy dog to a what the hell is?
That thing doing in here get it outside
Yeah, okay
Actually, can I just turn very quickly to some of the comments that we have on the micro dot-com site because I mean there's been
Some great stuff about the like the blogging before really really good
Martin you can't you can but I've got a job to do.
I'll go.
Okay.
Yeah we need sound effects.
Now I can continue.
Thank you.
That's fine.
That was almost a tragedy.
Yeah I mean we've we've got things here like Jean emotional support koalas that would actually
be great if they weren't endangered.
Every Australian should actually have one.
I would gladly welcome one.
Watch out for their claws.
They're very sharp.
Yeah they are.
They're not cuddly.
They'll try to eat you if you have eucalyptus on you because that's all that they eat.
They don't drink water. I don't know if many people know that they get all their water needs from the leaves fun fact for
We've also got Leon making the point about people taking dogs into cafes, that's true
I mean some babies get baby chinos and then you'll see that little dog bowl the dogs
You say that Andrew is that an American thing?
They have that little bowl outside of cafe a lot of places do yeah, and I think there there's like a there's something that the
The Starbucks place has it's like a thing for dogs. It's like a
Puppuccino or something like that. I'm not sure. Yes. I remember saying something like that. Yeah
I think it's literally just a cup of like whipped cream, which doesn't seem good, but oh
Oh my goodness, I'm seeing stuff about spiders in here now for people who've listened to our show for a little while now
You might recall that we had an HV mini episode that featured discussion of Huntsman
I can see here that Simon has made a comment and so has Pete about large spiders. Now I just want
to clarify because a lot of people I think who haven't been to Australia or you know I'm from
Australia are terrified of the spider situation. Basically if it's small you should maybe be
cautious because a lot of the poisonous ones are small. The large ones, the huntsman,
they terrify me personally and I've had too many run-ins with them in a car or bathroom or
something and then you have to have this double strategic situation of like the brush to flick
it away or the vacuum to stop it from entering your bed sheets or something it's just a nightmare
but um yeah occasionally you will be in a place of business or in your own home and a spider will
just appear and everyone just goes damn what do we do now? Yeah. Have you had that experience with
spiders? Yeah when the spider is has more arm hair than me that's when i get really scared and i know
Like you said they're probably less venomous than you need than anything small, but well, it's just gross. Yeah, that's the problem
That's the biggest problem
I found becoming an adult and a dad is it suddenly I'm expected to be able to handle these things and
You have to put a brave face on I don't work. We're a worm in our lounge room yesterday a worm
Pretty live in a swamp. How big was this worm? I know so weird and my five-year-old Benji freaked out
It's like well, it's screaming went down there. There's a worm crawling across one like well
I don't really want to deal with that worm either, but I guess I have to be brave about it and I threw it out
So looking about screaming though
There's a video that my sister-in-law
Continues to play on repeat over and over again every time we see her because one time I was visiting her family's place
There was a gigantic huntsman in the corridor near the bedrooms, and I was enlisted
To crush the spider and I know people don't really like that you're crushing the spider
But they often have like their babies nearby and it can be quite an infestation problem if you're not careful
And they didn't want to deal with it
I mean I was equally scared
But they sent me to do it and in the video that they have they are
Screaming their absolute lungs out and I'm swearing and they but because I'm saying just stop screaming with expletives thrown in and they just keep
Saying Martin we never hear you swear this way. We're just gonna keep playing this video on repeat
So I'm cursed with this never-ending video of having to deal with a spider while I yell out the f-word
They should come they should come visit me that I could fix that for them easily
Well, you had a little cute little spider you had to deal with the other day. Didn't you Jason? Yeah, it was adorable
it was like five inches long and it was very furry and
Apparently it was nothing. So
Can I bring up one more comment that I saw in the chat before I know we're a little bit over a little bit of time
Go miraz brought up a point that drives me up the
- Freaking wall.
Hold on, get the (beep)
Thank you.
She said, "It really upsets me when community organizations
"switch away from actual websites/blogs
"to something like Facebook."
And that pisses me off so much.
When you have a company with a global brand,
and then you take that and you say,
"Come visit us at facebook.com/whatever."
What is at fire your whole brand department?
They should all be fired immediately,
the second that happened.
That is the worst thing you could ever do ever.
Full stop.
Sorry, I read that and I got upset.
- You should be put in charge of all human resources, Jason.
It would be very, very effective.
- It's just so dumb.
You work your whole life to build a brand
and then you just throw it into the gutter that is Facebook.
You gotta be kidding me.
Anyway, that's all I had to say about that.
Well, I think that's a, I think you've done a great job bringing it full circle.
Jason, we started with blogging.
We meandered through the world of social media.
We ended up on pets, puffer jackets and spiders.
And now we just told every global brand to fire this stuff.
I think that's a good way to end it.
So you fired everyone.
That's a podcast.
Well done boys.
My goodness.
One last piece of housekeeping.
I just want to remind anyone that has left that if you have not already signed up to get your
micro camp sticker sent to you.
It's in the left navigation under stickers and prizes.
And you think, wait, stickers.
Okay.
That's a sticker.
What's a prize prize is door prizes.
All you have to do is go to the little form, pick a category and we'll be do
random, well, micro camp, we'll do random drawing for one of the categories.
You'll get a cool prize.
So check that out under stickers and prizes and thank you all for listening
to Hemispheric Views live from micro camp.
- It's been a blast.
(upbeat music)
- Yeah, do you think we did okay?
Was that okay?
- I think so, I don't think we lost anyone.
I didn't, I have a confession.
I didn't actually click a stream.
I forgot to click the box on.
- Oh Jason, you had one job.
- Far out.
- You're fired.
- Let's see here.
Three, two, oh, oh, wait, hold on.
Hold on, he's got a small screen.
He's got to move his dock so you can get the full.
- Okay, okay, count now.
- Okay, okay, here we go, here we go, here we go.
Three, two, one, stop.
