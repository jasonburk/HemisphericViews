The more I use Ventura the more I hate the new system settings. I think I have like a blindness to it as soon as there's that sidebar of all the options.
I just can't find anything like I thought the icons in the old view were difficult to isolate which one do I need but this wall of text.
Is just horrendous.
Do you ever just treat it like the internet and just search?
Well, I do. That's what I end up doing, but I feel like it's a failure of design
that I have to search.
The thing that I think is interesting about it is I agree, like, it's years of using system
preferences with the way that it was before. So I reckon it's just getting used to something new,
but it doesn't seem to show that whole thing that came in with Big Sur about more spacing
between things. You know how they made that big deal about greater gaps between items in menu
bars and people went, "Oh, does that mean they're going to bring in touch points or touch targets?"
And then they didn't, but then everything in system settings is more compressed.
So maybe just needs more breathing space. I don't know.
I just want to check in with you guys. Do I sound any different this week?
So much better. Like at least 60% better than you did in the past.
Okay.
Yeah, your new nickname is going to be Andrew Smooth FM Canyon. Is this right?
Well, I've Smooth FM'd my microphone. I've gone back to the old one. So for the longest time...
The superior one.
Probably for the last 50 episodes of Hemisphere Reviews, I've been running with the Rode Procaster.
And then I've switched back to the Shure SM, what is it, Jason? The SM7B.
That is the Shure SM7B.
That's right. So apparently this is the one that will give me my pure radio voice
coming to you live with hemispheric views.
I was telling you this before when you were testing with me. The thing that I think this
does for you is that that other one was, and I don't know what the terminology is, but you would
go your audio would go way low and then peak in a much smaller range with the other one.
So if you weren't speaking at the exact right tone all the time, you were either too low
or you were peaking.
This one, I feel like your range is so much wider now and it just sort of smooths and
feels good all the way across.
This is good news because, well this just introduces Andrew's singing corner.
More potential for that.
Last night I watched the Elvis movie last night.
Oh boy.
So.
Alright, off you go.
We're caught in a trap.
Can't look back.
Because I love you too much baby.
Why can't you see?
What you doing to me?
Wow, you both watched it.
When you don't believe a word I say.
Don't believe a word I say.
Wow.
I was just seeing the range.
See the range? I told you.
That's the short answer.
The range of the mic is good.
It's right there.
The subject, I'm not sure.
That was worth every penny of admission.
It's not often I'll give Andrew actual, like, lyrics.
And he's editing this one, so I've really walked into a trap.
I am your Colonel Parker right now.
Great.
Oh, we've got Christmas microphone.
I put a little Santa hat on my microphone.
Yeah, it's festive.
Martin, you know what you need to do now?
Oh, screenshot man.
Okay, we'll do that.
One second.
Everyone smiling.
All right.
Looks good.
Thank you.
We talked in our episode last week about our entirely new show notes system, didn't we?
We did. The one that we used for one show.
Yeah, it lasted one episode. And we're back to this amazing app called Craft,
which does...
We're back, baby!
It does feel good, actually, I gotta say.
God. And why are we back, Andrew?
Because you don't have to pay for it.
Yes! It's in setup, man.
And I'm pretty sure he didn't before, actually, but it doesn't matter. I'm in control now.
You know I've totally taken it twisted it turned it because not only am I not paying for it if you also use my setup promo code
To purchase your own copy of setup you're basically giving me free setup for even longer so get on that list I
Can tell you who's whose coupon code will not be in the show notes
It caught me the business for nothing
Speaking of advertising one's own referral codes,
there is a service out there that I want to promote.
It's called shoutouts.lol.
I am a happy customer of this service. It's produced by a friend of the show,
Vincent Ritter. We once reviewed his desk way back when you may
recall it, it was the one with the ejector button on it. So he could.
Can you clarify for me customer though,
Is that a paying customer or not?
I am paying.
So, so I have bought.
Cause we know how you are with, with the dollars going outward.
It's like not a thing that we, that you're into.
So I just wanted to.
So that, that alone.
Full transparency.
That alone should be review enough.
I paid money and Vincent has done an amazing thing where he has offered a range of price
points that you can select.
You can choose how much you wish to pay to use this service.
And I paid the maximum option.
That's how much I like it.
Wow. That's a lot of AUD.
Oh man. I actually didn't factor in the full conversion price.
So.
And for those who can't see our notes, what is it?
So shoutouts.lol.
We should just share the crap document with everybody on the internet so they can see the show notes.
It is, it's basically like a mini advertising platform,
but if you think about it is not, you know,
you're only advertising stuff that you really like and
you're not, you're not actually making revenue from the ads. So,
So the opposite of all other podcast ads,
cause they don't ever use any of the stuff they advertise.
So if you want to see it in, you can either go to shout outs to LOL,
or if you prefer, you can go to Andrew Canyon. No, you can't.
You can go to canyon.blog, get my URLs right.
- Hashtag knowledge management.
- Canyon.blog, and you will see at the top an ad.
Now I can't tell you what the ad will be
'cause it rotates through a bunch of them that I've set up,
but I have set up all the different services
and things that I enjoy.
So at the moment when I load it up,
I'm seeing an ad for Fastmail, all right?
I'm happy to promote Fastmail and advertise Fastmail
because I like it and I value it
and I think it's good, if you happen to click on that
and sign up, it is linked to my referral code.
So I might get a little bit of a tiny kickback,
but that's not really the point.
The point is like, this is the stuff that I use and trust,
and I want you to know about it.
So as well as advertising commercial services
like Fastmail, I have in there a link to Hemispheric Views,
and I have in there a link to shoutouts.lol.
I have micro.blog, like things that I like
and that I think are valuable.
And I just want to share with the internet.
So it's a good way of actually getting those referral codes
that we all have out there.
But I don't feel dirty about it, because Fastmail
aren't paying me to advertise.
I'm just putting it out there.
I'm helping a local creator, because he's
created the platform.
So I'm paying him for the platform.
You're shouting out.
I'm shouting out, yeah.
So I just think it's a really fun little way of--
And it's simple to implement as well,
which is a tick in my box,
to implement little interesting advertisements.
Now this is probably the first time I've ever been like
pro ad in my entire life, but there you go.
- That's an interesting point.
So first time in your life you've been pro ad
and yet you are the business.
- But no, I think, so I just wanna say thank you to Vincent
for creating shout outs to LOL.
I encourage you to go there, give it a go.
It gives a, you can try it for a month for free.
So you can try it on your website, see if you like it,
See if it works for you.
And if you do pay a little bit of money,
if you don't get rid of it, but I think it's great.
It's really fun.
And it's a fun little thing to play with
if you wanna upgrade your website.
So I just wanna play a game with you guys.
So you all have to go to canyon.blog.
And I want you to see, tell me.
- Are we doing that right now?
- Is this like live in the moment?
Okay.
Canyon.net, here we go.
Elvis yeah, that's that's what I watched last night obviously of course that's what's at the top in your shoutouts when you make us go
There did you know this?
Elvis was at the top. I didn't think about that. No. No, no the actual shout out the actual ad
Oh, look, I don't know. It's random. That's that's the beauty of it. So you got you got shout out
So are you both looking at NBL podcasts live now?
No, I got a much better one than that
What did you get Jason I got um galore hey
There we go.
Because I went of course it's like go check out my blog and what would be there.
Oh it's another fantastic podcast about national basketball in Australia.
And who does a podcast about that?
Your man Andrew Canyon.
Go Hawks!
He's got the balls.
Click the link.
And you can just command R your day away just seeing different pop ups.
I just did it.
I got an ad for Hemistrote Fuse.
It's beautiful.
Listeners may recall that in the last episode when we discussed pages, Jason was really
annoyed by dividers, big horizontal dividers that denoted pages.
And yet I can see that Jason has inserted large horizontal dividers between each episode.
Do you know what the difference is though?
I know there's a difference.
That's what I want to know.
I'm in control here.
I can put the divider anywhere I want.
None of this A4 dividers only BS.
Did you make it US custom letter size or something like that?
I can throw a little 8.5 by 11 your way if that'll do you right.
I can do that.
No problem.
Hey Jason.
What?
Yeah.
I've just added dividers.
How do you feel about that?
Thin ones that don't match the rest actually.
Is that deliberate?
Because it's troublesome.
You just delete them.
And I've just deleted them.
I can delete you from this note.
So just watch yourself.
Oh yeah.
Sounds good.
You're the captain.
I own this now.
Damn it.
Used to be the property of Andrew hide my email so I can't ever retrieve anything to do with my account Canyon.
Yeah that is the one good thing that came out of all this debacle is that now the true proper owner of the notes is in charge.
It should be that was the thing that most annoyed Jason about this entire notes journey we went on.
Every single day.
I'd signed up with Kraft with a Apple private relay email address
And he just had to look at the
Stupid email. No, that's not even the worst part
The worst part is because that put it in some weird state where you couldn't even give co-ownership to other people
So if something happened with that
Everything was gone
Because no one else had it like admin access to it. That's what drove me insane
We were building all this stuff and it was tied to this stupid private BS relay thing
That who knows when that's just gonna go away
So yeah that that was what I had the biggest issue with so that I was thrilled actually
When I just took all the files and then we were ended up back here anyway, so there you are
Pages was fun for that brief five minute interval though. That was good. It was it was interesting
I have not actually used pages for real in a long while. I would argue that maybe it wasn't for real
But I have not used it at all really in a quite a while. So it was interesting to see
Oh, yeah, it does sort of do sharing stuff now and it mostly works
For everything that I need so that's a good alternative. It was a fun test, but I'm thrilled that we're not doing that anymore
It's not my favorite
I'm happy
Andrew you have something to do with audio here.
Sonos.
What's the story?
This is a holdover.
It's been on the notes for a while and it's probably more pertinent six months ago whenever
I added it because I was this close to buying a Sonos system.
I was going to get...
I thought you did.
Well, this is exactly right.
I was that close.
I got the quote from the shop.
I was like, I talked him down on price.
I was just ready to go.
Wow.
You just said quote and negotiation about getting a Sonos thing.
And that's amazing in itself.
I created a row in my depreciation spreadsheet.
As you do.
I was all ready to go and then I didn't.
But I'm kind of, I know that was the sensible move to not buy that.
But there's still a part.
Why?
Because it was expensive or because you don't need it?
Because I don't really need it.
Right.
But every day I'm getting these paper cuts with our current sound system.
And I keep thinking, we just want to solve this problem.
So.
Can you elaborate on, it's not made of paper and it's not physically cutting you.
These are metaphorical paper cuts.
And without the 30 year duration of the story of how painful it's been for you, just in like.
Okay.
Yeah, it's like in 30 seconds instead of 30.
It's funny you mentioned 30 years because I've had the speaker system for probably about 25, right?
For 30.
They were energy connoisseur speakers.
They don't even sell them anymore.
Energy company got bought out.
They're a Canadian company.
I've got the C7's bookshelf, like not bookshelf, full tower speakers.
I think they're up to the C8's now.
C1, like a center speaker.
I've got a big subwoofer.
Shut up, Jason.
And it's running through an amplifier receiver, which I had to buy a new one of those not long ago.
So that's not fully depreciated.
That was the Denon 92876, I believe, right?
I think it actually is a Denon, Jason.
I couldn't remember the brand, but I think it might.
We talked about it.
Thanks, man.
And that's all going into the new LG C1 TV, OLED TV.
The sound is still good, right?
And what I found, I found it was a bit muddy.
I actually increased the channel volume of my center speaker.
So it's louder in preference to the sides.
And it's good, right?
It's not surround, it's like 3.
What do they call that?
That's 3.1.
Got 3.1. - 3.14.
- So. - Hi.
- But every time, well, not every time,
probably three times out of 10,
when I switched to the Xbox input, it squishes it.
The ratio gets squished.
And the only way I can seem to fix that is by unplugging the Denon, not turning it off,
literally unplugging it.
So that whatever HDMI ratio transfer thing it's doing.
And because the TV needs to run at high frame rate and use its video game capabilities,
I've got everything switching through the receiver, except for the Xbox, which is switched
through the TV.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on.
I got to put a pause here for a second.
We started this conversation about Sonos and audio.
This is all a video problem.
Why are we talking about audio when this is an HDMI video problem?
How did we get from audio to video problem?
Forget all of that then.
All I want to say is I feel like these speakers are still perfectly good sound,
but they're not surround and they're old.
All right, I have a question that hopefully turns into a solution for you.
Do you do you have a second lounge room or a rumpus room or study or something that isn't your main living room where the TV is?
Yes.
Right. Do you have a nice source of music in that TV-less space?
Does a HomePod count as a nice source of music?
Is that a single HomePod?
Yes.
Right. So what I'm going to suggest here is that it sounds like you need a more modern setup.
iPod Hi-Fi.
various audio and video,
I put high five, yep, great.
No, it sounds like you need a more modern setup
to make yourself happy with Xbox, et cetera,
and all the various video and audio problems that you have.
- I like where this is going. - Take the dive,
buy some new stuff, right?
Deck out the main lounge room
so you're happy with all inputs and outputs.
Move the legacy system that you still love
and make an audio space,
which is your escape from the video crap.
And you have a nice place to sit down and unwind
that's away from the TV.
- 'Cause audio is audio. - And then move the HomePod.
Yeah, audio is audio.
And then move the HomePod to, I don't know,
a bedroom or another room where that can just be itself
as a single speaker and that doesn't have
to fill a room by itself.
- I love this idea.
This is great. - 'Cause the whole thing
shuffles down, you keep everything, there's no waste,
and you're happy with the new system.
There you go, Martin Solutionfeld.
- You talk to Nick, you get a record player
to go with the old speakers so it all fits together,
it's all made of wood.
You saw his lovely chat in the discord about his vinyl.
That's great.
Make it happen.
So then you've got a cool music room
where all of the pressure of a modern set of requirements
has taken off the speakers that you love.
- Doesn't matter.
- That's a pretty good idea actually.
And then you don't need surround sound because it's music.
- No, it's what they call stereo.
- That's pretty good.
That's a pretty good solution.
Can one of you guys come over and help me run some cable?
- Easily, yeah, for sure.
- Why are you running cables?
- Just a speaker cable.
- Are you fixing a bluebird or something?
- A speaker cable.
(laughing)
- You got a trunk that's screwed up or something?
Martin, that's cat five.
We don't use speaker cable for that.
Come on.
- I wasn't sure.
Maybe it's more broken and it's something heavy duty
or longer, I don't know.
- Maybe the hood, maybe if the hood needs to be closed,
maybe that speaker wire in the trunk
is more of a cat five situation.
That could be.
- Speaking of hood, when I bought those speakers
20 years ago, I got hood winked
into buying monster cable, monster audio cable.
- Oh, wow.
- Wow. - Gold plated.
- I thought you were going down the path of something
like 20 years ago when I bought that when I was into hood.
And I was like, oh, this is gonna be
like a really bad dad joke.
- No, we all make mistakes in life.
And that was my mistake in life.
But to be fair, that monster cable 20 years on
is still doing its thing.
- Well, I mean, to be a length of copper
sitting in one stagnant location for 20 years,
That's a lot to, it's a lot of pressure to put on something.
So I'm glad it was able to hold up to that.
All right.
Thanks.
Good job.
Monster $3,200.
So sold.
It sounds like it's solved problem to me.
Yeah.
I think, I think you've got your solution and you come out better in every respect.
Yeah.
You're not getting rid of anything.
You get to reuse the stuff you have.
You got a whole new setup now in the other area.
Win, win, win, win, win, win, win.
This does still require me opening my wallet.
That's the final, the final hurdle.
It's the holiday season.
I would say go for it.
Cause I think it's well known in the business world that in the month of
December, anything purchased does not have to be entered into the record.
That's true.
It is free spending.
Yeah.
You just delete all those cells, Andrew.
It's fine.
Any other problems?
Any other big, big life problems you need solved right now?
Cause I think we're on a roll.
Hmm.
Now you put it, are you asking me specifically?
I think Martin has a life problem.
Hmm.
Martin.
No.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Now he's being present.
What's the problem, Andrew?
What's my problem?
Um, I'm trying to think of something without being offensive.
Um, good luck.
I'm going to let the listeners decide.
We could probably just go to the next topic.
I bet that would be a safer. I was just about to run with it. I have too much body hair
What do I do? I feel like I feel like I'm perfectly happy with my body here. Thank you the next topic probably would be better
How much have you seen Andrew to make such a comment?
Just the tuft just the tuft in I can see popping off the tuft. Oh, okay. It's gonna be hot in here Andrew
I'm gonna have to okay next topic
next topic
Let's focus on the next topic. Nice. I love that. Um, I want to talk quickly
Mostly in a in a question format about
Focus modes which have been around for somewhere between one and 87 months
I don't remember when they came out. I've only started using them recently
But I use them every single day now
Kind of and what I mean by kind of is I use basically two of them that are automatically
Happening and I don't actually actively do anything with them. So I
Use a work focus mode now where it automatically turns on and it automatically turns off
every day during the week and then I use a
podcasting one
When I talk to you all that goes on and off for the times that we generally record
Obviously that changes a little bit
Depending on scheduling, but usually it's roughly the same and I never really I didn't go like
Hardcore where like the focus mode is triggering a shortcut to change my watch to make my phone wallpaper
Like don't care the point of the whole thing is that I don't want to be looking at other crap
So I really don't need it to change anything else because I shouldn't be looking at that stuff anyway
So there's really no point in changing what my phone apps are or anything like for me. It doesn't matter
I just want it to be like shut the hell up during the week while I'm working to try to give me less things happening
and I've actually found the work one to be like really really helpful and just
Focusing on stuff during the day and not getting so oh, here's a shiny thing over there. Oh, I got a I message
Let me go look at that
Oh, I got a notification about whatever and then at five o'clock or whatever whenever I have it turn off
It's like okay now go do that stuff
Doesn't mean I don't still like go and do other crap during the day
Like I'm human and my brain can't just look at the same thing for eight hours
So I don't think I would fault anyone for that
But that's how I mostly use it is the work one in the podcast one
So I kind of just was curious if either of you have toyed with them at all either in a very basic capacity
of like a work one or
Did you go down the path of like when the focus mode happens like your whole?
Everything like flips around and changes. So what do you have to say about that?
Oh, and also I like the little symbols that show up in your menu bar when you're in a little focus mode
I like that to hate that
Okay, I hate that Andrew. Why do you hate that? It's distracting. It's mainly on my watch when I sit on my watch. I
Find it distracting. I don't know. Well, we'll start with Andrew then because clearly he's super into focus mode. So Andrew, what's your focus mode situation?
Yeah, I do. Yes. No, I do use them and it's like like you it's automated. So it goes from like a
Worky kind of mode but mines gear located for my work stuff. So when I actually go into my office
location. Oh, interesting. Okay.
Toggles to work mode because I tried it with time,
but I found that I just didn't really didn't vibe with me.
So I just wanted it to be when I go to this place, give me this context.
That's cool. I, yeah, I don't go anywhere.
So obviously I don't use that one, but I mean, I know,
I think that's legitimately cool that you can, then the time doesn't matter.
It's just, and if you happen to be at home that day, yeah, yeah. It's like,
That it just doesn't turn on.
And it's good.
And it's good.
Cause my work, it goes into like super boring mode.
It, it makes my, changes my desktop image.
It gets rid of most of my icons and just leaves me basically with Outlook and a
calendar on my homepage.
And it's like, Oh, okay.
Right.
This is where we're at.
Yeah.
And I say that, that, that is what I think.
With just Excel in the dock.
Like the only thing in the dock is Excel.
Yeah.
Oh, and my two factor authenticator, because you could use that like 60 million times.
Oh yeah, you have to authenticate to Microsoft every 45 minutes, right?
That's a whole topic in itself.
Oh, it isn't just.
That Microsoft authenticator app.
Sorry, your watch failed to authenticate you.
No, it didn't.
The screen is awake.
Get a grip.
Anyway.
So you mainly just use the one for work then?
Yeah.
And I have a, and then I have a, like a night mode.
Like a, I think it's the.
Oh, the sleep.
Oh shoot.
Yeah.
Sleep.
Not sleep.
So I do use sleep as well.
And I use the wake up schedule and all that kind of stuff.
But then I have a, what do they call it?
Personal, the little purple one.
Where it goes in and that's.
So you have like a pre-sleep.
Yeah.
So that's like my.
Like a shut down.
It's like Andrew.
The wind down.
It's not even wind down.
Stop distracting me, fellas.
It's the personal.
It's like the personal one where I'm not at work.
And this is like I'm, I actively don't even want to think about work because it's like evening time.
This is me.
Got it.
So like white goodman from dodgeball it's your private reflection period.
The slice of pizza.
So this is where I get to do all the fun stuff on my phone.
So it's RSS, glue on, you know, it's all the good social media stuff, not Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.
They're all gone.
You know my favorite thing about how this is gone?
I hate that.
Oh, okay.
Andrew's got some thoughts.
Here are all the ways that I love to use focus modes.
I just love everything about it.
It's like it's like it's non default I don't want to be reminded that I'm in this mode.
Right just let me be just let me be in the mode.
Like paradoxical contradictory it's like you're focusing but I'm going to keep reminding you with this distracting thing.
I don't need to see that icon like get rid of it.
You could hide it.
I just, I don't think you can.
But not on the watch.
I think like if you turn, like if you turn your wrist with an always on display, it will flash up that focus thing.
Same as it does with walkie talkie, which I also find annoying.
I can't use walkie talkie.
I had to turn that off again because that walkie talkie kept flashing at me.
I can't.
Yeah, I actually, I agree.
I want just a slight digression with walkie talkie.
I love walkie talkie on the watch and I would just love to have it available and activated all the time.
So that if Natasha wants to get in touch with me, for example, if we you know get separated at the shops or one of us has Mac or something super good for that.
Where are you? No worries.
Yeah, but to have that permanently yellow thing going up saying by the way, you could be you could be contacted just just letting you know, you're just checking the time but
You're available.
Just don't forget.
It's really annoying right and I get that.
They don't want you to forget that you're in a focus mode or that you're contactable, but I'm an adult.
Give me a toggle.
I can deal with it.
That's it.
Yes I get what you mean with the icon Andrew.
The only thing worse than the focus mode icon is the inability to synchronize red status for iMessages.
Sorry what really like I think I've had that problem so iMessages if I read it on my phone if I read it on my phone.
If I read it from the notification and let's add like properly dismiss it it still stays the badge on the.
I message app and then it still stays as a red message on my watch which I still have to clear if I happen to read it from my watch first that red status doesn't sink to my phone so I have to go look at it and like clear the little bubble little unread icon.
I hate that so much I've got to read every message like four times to properly clear it.
I have noticed that with notification center or the history it persists but I haven't noticed a problem with the badges or in the app
It's like I've read it somewhere else, but it's still in my iPads notification center
But if I turn that off then I never see messages from people with banners if I happen to be reading on the iPad rather
Than with my phone. It's a disaster. That's a bit weird. It's a whole disaster. I hate it. But anyway, that's not a focus mode
So Martin, how do you deal with focus modes?
I think they're a good thing
I do occasionally use like the work one, like what Jason was talking about, but I don't really set up
Anything to be custom or do anything with geo fences or timing or you seem to do a lot more than what I do Andrew
You know what?
I generally like to do that if I'm sitting down at my computer and I don't want to be disturbed
I just hit the f6 do not disturb key on my keyboard
Yeah, and then that's it. And then when I'm finished I turn it off
So I find it's kind of like my attitude towards home automation and lots of other things
I think it's awesome that people do it or they set up scenes or they do custom things not to be interrupted
but I find the mental overload of having to
Customize this automated life to be more annoying than just going
Press a key and then press it when I'm finished. So that's my attitude
Andrew you okay? You're kind of looking a bit shocked. I use he didn't realize f6 existed
I think I use all my function keys all the time. My f6 even has a little coating of dust on it
I use the brightness the X-Pose a f4 it's got a little moon on it for through to f6
so basically a like a dead zone to me yeah you've got your search like a
spotlight you've got a dictation you're not disturbed yep I mean I just hit
command space but it's nice that it's there if your fingers are hovering there
he doesn't even know what's on his keyboard yeah cuz cuz command space I
I always have to remap it because I use that for launch bar,
but then I've always like initiated a spotlight search from launch bar.
Did you literally just say you launch spotlight via launch bar?
Seriously?
Oh my gosh.
Because you would usually use command space, but launch bar gets that.
That's a great question. Wow.
It's only thanks to Jason about three months ago that I remembered that I had the
globe key for emoji. No kidding.
I used to struggle with emojis so much.
So the globe key.
Command option space. If you want to triple the experience.
That was the one I could never remember.
Get a custom keyboard and just remap everything. If you want to just go.
Oh sorry, command control space. My mistake. Command control space.
So yeah, I'm just F6ing. Look at that little moon on and off.
See I like the moon it's like all the moon's okay nighttime mysterious
Okay this is amazing
Lucky it's a crescent because then it would just be a planet
There any other buttons on this thing that I don't know about?
Andrew's holding his keyboard up to the camera I'm gonna do the same just
Pretty familiar with all the other buttons
I can't lift mine it weighs too much
It weighs like a good probably six pounds
It's the same thing isn't it?
No I got a new keyboard
Again? Yeah.
How many of you did that typing challenge this episode?
No, because I had to get rid of that one.
That's why the notes say my keyboard hurt me.
What the heck?
Alright, let's hear why it hurt you. Sorry listeners to disappoint, we can't do it because Jason was mortally wounded by his keyboard.
I was. So I got the A1048. I love it. It's great. But you know how the keys are really hard to press?
Like they're real like...
Squishy, I guess?
How would you describe it, Ben?
- They're taller. - Mushy?
- They're taller.
- But like they're like to push them down.
- Travel distance?
- They're not like clicky, they're more.
- Yeah, travel distance.
There's no like click to it.
It's like depress into your letter.
- Yeah, so typing on that for a week,
my hands were hurting so badly.
- It's like typing on a blamange.
- It's like typing on,
trying to think of what would be a good,
good representation.
Like each key is like gummy candy and you got to like really shove it down to get it to register.
And yeah, it hurt me physically.
So I had to actually stop using it because of the pain in my hands, which has always been there.
And this just accentuated that.
So I had to actually I had to stop using it, unfortunately, even though I loved it.
So what you obviously haven't gone back to the standard Apple keyboard.
No, no, actually my new keyboard now has rendered my Apple
keyboard unusable because I just can't even touch it.
It's awful to even feel it at this point,
which is weird because it used to be the best keyboard ever, but not anymore.
So.
So what are you using now I'm lost.
So I now have the, I think it literally weighs six pounds.
It is the Q1, the mechanical keyboard thingy with the knob.
It'll be in the notes.
It's a joy.
- Open this up, what is it?
- It is the-- - What's it called?
- It is the Keychron Q1.
- Oh, Keychron.
- Full aluminum body, stainless steel, watcha mahoos it.
It is phenomenal.
- Is it version two?
- It is version two.
- Has a bit of a Lumen Industries vibe to it
if you get the blue one.
- I got the gray with the yellow accents.
It is an absolute joy to type on.
I love it so much.
- So I'm guessing the travel or the distance
with the depressing of the keys
is very similar to the Apple keyboard,
but it's not mushy because it's mechanical.
That's what you're saying?
- Yeah, I got the lightest like pressy ones
so that my finger--
- So not the blues?
- No, not the blues.
I got the brown, I believe.
So it's very easy to just--
it's really good.
I know nobody cares about people talking
about mechanical keyboards, so I'm not
going to dwell on it, but it is a really, really
phenomenal keyboard.
That put yourself down.
I tried using my Apple one again.
I can't.
So now I'm going to rip apart the Apple one
and make a little Touch ID button, standalone.
project. Because that's the only thing is just touch ID. I mean that's kind of
table stakes at this point. That little thing is not a touch ID sensor it's a
little twist. It's a little knob. So you can in it well right now it just does
volume and then if you press it it mutes but it's fully programmable so you can
make it do whatever you want. Now I noticed this key doesn't have a
have a spotlight button on it so I was gonna say I think it's a shame I'm sorry that you were hurt
Jason but I'm glad that you're in a happier space and you're still going to rip apart a touch id
thing so power to you whatever yeah I still wanted personally do the typing test thing so we have
something to put in the notes maybe we'll throw it up on our YouTube channel as well but with that
in mind since we've got maybe a few more minutes to still hit our kind of average 45 minute-y thing
once edited. I don't know if you two saw but Zachary in our discord, quick shout out for
listener Zachary, said that he actually really enjoys Andrew's Business Corner segments. And
I thought I'll be less of a felled foot today. I might let him finish off this episode with a bit
of a Business Corner, but I'm still going to be a bit of a foot by surprising you with it and saying
you just got to come up with it. Jason, you have your hand up.
Can I please interrupt quickly before we move to Business Corner? I have one small
anecdote I would like to put forth.
Oh, I love anecdotes.
Please go.
Um, I got a new mouse today as well.
And of course, that's not really what I wanted to talk about.
It was more about the story and then something that I found at the store that I wanted to
ask you both about.
So I ordered three items online for in-store pickup.
Cool.
Okay.
And they're supposed to be within an hour.
Okay, great.
So I wait a little bit and then I head off to the store thinking, "It's surely going
to be less than an hour to go grab like three tiny things off of a shelf.
Can't take that long."
So I get there.
No update yet.
Still waiting.
I'm like, "Hmm.
Okay.
Well, guess I'll go walk around the store a little bit and could have just picked these
up myself, but here we are."
The reason I should back up, the reason I did the thing where you buy it online to pick
pick up in store is 'cause all too often is it the thing
where you look on the line and it's like,
yeah, we have that, and then you go there
and they're like, oh yeah, we don't actually have that.
I'm like, cool, I drove all the way here
to not get the thing.
So if I do the online thing instead,
usually that gives you some indication
that it's gonna be a go.
Anyway, that's a thing.
Maybe that happens to you all there as well, I'm not sure.
I imagine it happens everywhere.
So, okay, so I'm at the store, I'm picking up the things,
getting the mouse, whatever.
Three items I ordered.
The little thing, I get an email, "Your item's here."
I'm like, "Great."
So I go up to the thing, pick it up.
"One of the three is ready."
I'm like, "Okay."
So they hand it to me, and I'm like,
"What about the other ones?"
They're like, "Oh, they're not ready yet."
Okay, so I'm waiting and I'm waiting,
I get another email.
Ah, great, okay, this must be the other two.
Go up.
Number two of three, by itself.
Okay, here's the second one, cool.
Third one?
No, it's not ready yet.
Okay.
Continue walking around the store,
just like an idiot, looking at nothing,
waiting for--
- Carrying two things that--
- Carrying two things that I've already paid for.
So, that's weird.
At this point, after the first item,
the game became, can I go find the item myself
within the store before I get the email of them finding it.
Spoiler, found it way before.
- Really?
- And then the third one, I went looking around,
I was like, ooh, a bit of a challenge.
I can't seem to find this one.
Well played, okay.
So the hunt is on.
So I'm looking around everywhere, looking around,
and then I get to a point where I'm like, you know what?
They don't actually have this third one.
I'm just gonna leave.
I'm gonna gamble and just leave
with the two that I have.
But the thing that happened,
meantime, while I was looking around
at all of the random crap they have
that I do not care about,
was a security system called, what?
Kangaroo.
And I was like, well, surely,
this is an Australian security company.
It must be.
So I wanted to know,
do you all use kangaroo security in Australia?
- Well, I assume by what you mean,
it's this kind of pack where they all come as joeys
and then you kind of rear them and grow them in your backyard and then you essentially encircle your own home with a range of very,
very cranky live marsupials.
If that's the case, then yes, that's the security system.
That is what they sell here.
Yes.
Okay.
I just wanted to check.
Does it literally, does the camera square up to you if you try to steal something and just give you a couple of one, two punches and a kick in the guts?
I was a little sad that the branding could have been so much better given the name kangaroo.
It was pretty lackluster to be honest.
So that made me think that it probably wasn't related to you all,
but I just wanted you to know that we do have a security company apparently
called kangaroo.
So we'll get them for IP infringement.
They're there.
That that's our national emblem.
Like how dare they?
It's like when you say,
you know,
foreign companies or even Australian businesses,
you know,
really,
really respectfully,
you know,
using words like boomerang to talk,
you know,
about their fast whip around service or something,
you know,
whether without any sense of cultural appropriation or disrespect to first
nations people. I like that as a, you know, bit of an edgy, you know,
inappropriate decision.
It's good business practice.
Did you get your third item?
Probably. Uh, no.
So I took a gamble and left thinking if I can't find it,
they're not going to be able to find it. Right. I mean,
they're walking around with their little Samsung tablets or whatever,
trying to hunt and peck for things. So I left, got home,
Boom, email, your item not available at this store at this time.
Yes.
Well done.
So I took the gamble and won.
Did you get a refund?
Take that.
I haven't bothered to do any of that.
Dude.
But hopefully.
That's parody number one.
I had to get my computer working so I could record the show.
But doesn't he still want the item?
That's why he ordered it.
Yeah, but don't let, don't let them put that money on the short term money market.
It's yours.
So you're telling me you would return it and then order it again later instead of just waiting for it to come back in stock?
Well, are they guaranteeing that they will supply it?
I mean, is there anything to guarantee in this world? We don't know.
Have you discussed this with an appropriate manager to see what kind of things need to be ironed out in their supply chain and logistical procedure, Jason?
Because that's what it sounds like Andrew's suggesting in the ideal lean manufacturing and operations environment.
That's a good segue to our final business corner segment, Andrew.
You've had...
Business corner.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I just, I had to get that in.
I just felt it was so appropriate for today.
No, I think it's great because we got an extra story out of it.
And not only were we given a top tip, leave the shop if it takes too long.
Andrew was given some more time to think.
I thought you were going to prompt me with something.
I need like a...
I'm like a...
No, you are the business.
You are a walking encyclopedia of business.
What are we going to build a slide deck for you next?
Like what do you think this is I thought it was like a fractal and I started with a seed number
Andrew don't tell me you're one of those people where there's some sort of shared drive or corporate intranet and all resources are there just
A click or a search away and perfectly organized folders
But you ask the person who's the custodian of it to send you the link to the thing you already had six times
Yeah, yeah, that's right
Right beneath me
He sent me that PDF again
Yeah
I know you emailed it to me but could you just email me again so it's at the top of my inbox?
Because I can't search.
What can we talk about for Business Corner today?
Let's talk about the difference between marketing, branding and selling.
People often just put it all together into one thing, right?
But there actually is a difference between them all.
So when you're branding, you're creating an impression, you are building the non-tangible
intellectual property of your entity.
Is Apple really worth anything without the Apple logo?
Yeah, it has tooling, it has machines, it has iPhones, but the essence of the Apple
is the brand and that's where the value of that company lies in so many ways.
But Apple, they still need to get out there and do marketing, don't they?
The value of the asset, the value of that Apple logo is only enforced by marketing and
telling you about it and saying, "Hey, look, we've got a new iPhone 14.
Hey, look, we've got this thing.
Look, it's a new Mac.
Come buy it."
They communicate with you through various means, print, billboard, electronic.
Used to use Twitter.
less less a case these days I believe right so this and then they're selling
this is selling experience okay they've told you about it you have a feel-good
emotion about the product you still need to go and sell it they need to actively
make it easy to extract the money from you so that you get something in return
and feel good about it so that the brand promise has been delivered so they have
multiple ways of selling to you. You can go online and buy it. You can do buy it online, go in the store and collect it.
And hopefully they'll have all three of your items waiting for you at one time. That's all part of the grand promise.
So that and then you go in there, you know, would you like to pay cash, credit or if you're in America, we'll even accept a check.
But don't try that in Australia because you're an idiot.
There are different ways that's selling, that's smoothing the transactional process.
So marketing, branding, selling, three different things.
That was Business Corner.
I know that you're editing so that won't get cut out.
So I hope everyone is is enjoying that.
I thought it was great. Thank you.
I hope Zachary enjoyed Business Corner because he's the only one.
No, I'm joking.
He's the only one.
Sorry, I tuned out, Andrew. What did you say?
You know what I loved about that segment and preceding Business Corners as well is that right on brand with the very discussion that Andrew was undertaking, just that beautiful mini lecture he delivered to all of you, dear listeners, that in itself was a branding exercise for Andrew Canyon.
living up to the name, the business. So Andrew lives and exhibits what he sells, what he preaches.
So I think the lesson out of all of this is be more like Andrew.
Yeah. So I want to personally thank Andrew for that lesson. And I want to thank the sponsor of
that segment, Masterclass, where if you use the code "Canyon", you can get 43 months of free
access, unlimited, to Masterclass.
And I'll have a link to that on my shoutouts.
And if you want to learn more about me or the services I can deliver you simply go to linkedin.com/in/andrewcanyon.
Wow, that was a full LinkedIn link.
And then you can endorse him with the skill of hyperlinking or something really.
There's the challenge.
There's a challenge for everybody.
Okay, I want every listener of this podcast to connect with me on LinkedIn, right?
Oh, God.
And then...
Please, I really want to see this. I want to see it.
And then I want everybody to endorse me for podcasting, marketing, branding and selling.
But just choose one skill. If you actually want people to do it, you've got to choose one skill.
No one's doing... All right, everyone, do what Andrew says. But Andrew, what's the one skill
that they need to endorse you for?
- Podcasting.
- Podcasting, okay.
You heard the man, get on LinkedIn
and make sure that you,
do you want them to include a note or not?
Should they just blindly?
- No, they should because I do have a general LinkedIn policy
of not accepting anything from randos.
So you need to make sure you like,
give me a clue, seriously.
That would be hilarious.
