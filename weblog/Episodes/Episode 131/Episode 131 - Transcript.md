ah so we weren't going to do a show this week we were actually going to have a holiday until

first ever first ever if jason allows it first ever we're going to have a holiday

and then we got mentioned on another podcast so we thought we better not do the one the one time

that we might get a few new listeners let's not go on holiday best laid plans whoops

that would be the best though is ever anybody that showed up would be like wait it's over

already like that was it yep sorry but sign up for one prime plus anyway yeah yeah mentioned on

connected podcast that took a moment for them to remember what our show was called but they got

there in the end so i'm taking that as a win they could have just never come up with the name and

just trailed off yeah yeah but we got there so we we are here we are the hemispheric fuse podcast

hi i'm

andrew are you frozen again andrew andrew you cut off and so we heard nothing that you

i think you you totally froze and we heard nothing oh really i'll try again i'll say so

this is the hemisphere reviews podcast hi i'm andrew no i'm not doing it i refuse i'm frederick

wait am i no and anybody that came by is now gone nice to see y'all for three minutes

do you want to do topics

or yeah we'll do that off you go okay because although you didn't i said there could be no

vacations i did allow a slight tweak that we could do a slightly shorter show so that is allowed

beautiful we've got half an hour i think that's what i'm setting as the foot slash magnet

the foot magnet that's me the felled foot magnet the force felt time timer is set for 30 minutes

go this internet this internet today is shy

okay turn your camera off then oh yeah do that i don't want to i don't want to be one of those

guys that's just an excuse you're using corporate and he's frozen oh my god i can't i can't work in

these conditions let's turn our cameras off that doesn't work that doesn't make any difference

but let's try it andrew turn your camera off i'm leaving mine on so you can see my looks of

disgust when you when you break up okay dink he's gone this i think we've taken a vacation

i think we're gonna call it i think this is it this is uh whatever this was 131 will continue

two weeks from now uh thank you all for joining us and we will see you in a fortnight i'm gonna

go back to listening to my ipod hi-fi

all right first topic this hv mini is just going swimmingly isn't it

hmm the first topic okay so this is a group topic okay i'll put it in the description box and i'll

put it in the notes but i feel it's a group topic because we know that this is hemisphere reviews

where we discuss happenings in the u.s and australia and around different places sometimes

known as global but apple has started re-advertising on x okay this is after tim cook gave a thousand

thousand dollars a million dollars a thousand dollars here here's a dollar here's a i mean

in reality

it's like a thousand dollars to like a normal person so they gave a million bucks that was

very dr evil of you andrew one million dollars the inauguration um yeah and then apple recommences

advertising on x elon musk president elon musk's um social media network now i'm just drawing a few

dots here but what the actual f is going on um i blogged about this the other day just with a

really quick one

and because i don't like to do this normally but it's one of those moments where you go what would

steve jobs do and i put a poster a picture of the steve jobs giving the finger to the ibm sign

tim cook however in all his corporate awareness says no i'm going to sidle up to the most

incompetent evil corrupt government organization plus some unelected official that runs a social

network and advertise corporations are psychopaths and there is a movie from 2003 that had noam chomsky

saying exactly that the movie is called the corporation i encourage you all to watch it

i've seen it it's dated now in 2003 but the it is exactly the same corporations are not people

corporations are evil corporations will do what serves them best and that best will change they

are not your friend that's all

was there was there a point of of discussion there are you just stating facts well

look jason you're you're a correspondent felt more like a like a soapbox than a

discussion topic you're a correspondent on the ground in the uh the homeland oh boy jason um

do you have a view on this we all like apple products the company is crumbling before us

the government's crumbling before us what is going on yeah um no i i mean i'm there's nothing i could

say that hasn't already been expressed as far as like apple like and like what would steve jobs do

i don't give a fuck what steve jobs he's not here like that's just the fact of the matter like you

can't take somebody from history and put them in today's world and expect them to act the same

so i don't care what he would do today it doesn't really matter if he was here or not um

i don't really care what apple does anymore either to be perfectly honest

like they make some stuff it's fine none of this is easy it's all very complicated and annoying

and if nothing else maybe finally after all these years of people complaining about apple

and then continuing to just keep buying shit

year after year after year maybe they'll actually change their mind and do something different

that would be amazing it's still the same case today that it's been for the last 10 years

vote with your wallet like saying that tim cook is bad and then buying the newest iphone

really isn't doing much folks i'm sorry it's just not and that goes for everything you deal with

twitter facebook every company don't use them

you can't

say they're evil and then use them and be like well but i need it for my friend like no

don't use them like full stop like this used to be kind of a fun topic for people to argue about but

the actual shit has hit the fan and the shit is spreading everywhere it's in the u.s now it's

gonna the shit will go outside of the u.s like everywhere else all of the things that people

liked from the u.s that kind of merged into other parts of the country or

other parts of the world all the pieces that people didn't like that merged into the other

parts of the world this is exactly that so that's i could probably scream about this for hours this

is not the show people want so i'm gonna stop because it's just making me more upset so that

is my answer as correspondent on the ground live to you with better internet than andrew so there's

no delay thank you

i

I put my money where my mouth is and I've got some money mouse mouth follow-up.

So, you remember last week we were talking about the Logitech MX Master?

Wait, you have what?

What?

You have money what?

Money mouse?

What's a money mouse?

I'm putting my money where my mouse is.

Oh, okay.

Got it.

I'm on board now.

Yep.

So, yeah, you guys all had the MX Master S version and I was slumming it with the MX Master 3 and you had the 3S.

Immediately after that show ended, I went to Officeworks and I got them to price match guarantee an MX Master 3S against the offer on Amazon.

So, I have supported our friends at Officeworks.

Officeworks by taking their money, but not so much because they took less of my money.

And now I have an MX Master 3S.

Look at that.

And the buttons, Jason, I understand what you mean now when you say the buttons are not clicky.

They are so silent.

It's incredible.

Right?

It really is.

It sounds stupid, but once you actually do it, you're like, oh, this is great.

I love this.

Great for podcasting too.

It's amazing.

And I've taken my old one to work.

So, my old one is still there.

It's a new spit out work.

But this one does have a clicky element to it still.

Jason, you may be able to speak further on this, but the little spinny wheel, it just notches ratchets nicely.

Click, click, click, click, click, click.

You're going to do the freewheeling like we said.

The freewheeling.

There is a fix for that.

If you push the button above it, it'll put it into the correct mode, which is freewheeling.

Well, are you sure it's the correct mode?

Because I think you've done a scientific poll on this.

We do have a poll going.

I don't think it's ended yet.

Have you seen the results?

I think they were favoring my side when I last looked.

Live update.

I don't know how to get back to a poll once you have sent one.

As we've seen with popular votes or any of that stuff, that doesn't really mean that it's right.

Oh, no.

We've got the electoral college in our Mastodon poll.

Damn it.

We've been screwed again.

There's still time left, though.

We can still turn this around.

There's still 15 hours left to get this swung back to the right way of smooth scrolling.

Where's Mitch McConnell when you need him?

I'm going to have to make multiple accounts to rectify this poll thing.

Yeah.

Martinfeld 2, Martinfeld 3, Martinfeld 4.

So if you want to, I guess my point there to wrap it around and tie it in a neat little bow is don't go spending money on apples.

Magic Mouse, which is a piece of garbage.

Definitely not.

Spend it on the Logitech.

Orchards and Waterfalls.

Logitech, which I think is a European company.

So it'll probably be highly tariffed now for you in the US, but good luck with that.

Are they Swiss?

I don't know.

I feel like they're Swiss.

I feel like they're Norwegian or something.

Up that way.

Firsties.

We're only in firsties next to the woods.

In Japan, they're called Logi-cool because there was some kind of weird trademark issue.

So everything says Logi-cool.

Yes.

Can we please take the question that was just posed by Andrew or myself or, I don't know, was it a question or speculation?

Anyway, whoever's correct about, you know, in answering that question, a little point goes to the unannounced trivia corner tally.

Oh.

Please.

Oh, okay.

Perfect.

So you said Japan and I said Switzerland.

Let's see who's close.

I didn't say Japan.

Okay.

No, he said.

I said firsties next to the woods.

You said Norway.

Norway, sorry.

Norway.

Sweden.

I heard Japan somewhere.

Somewhere up there.

Clearly I was confused.

I was confused.

Greenland.

Okay.

So it's part of the US.

I will do that.

I will do that.

I will ensure that an extra point is allotted to the correct person.

If no one gets it, you both lose a point, which means nothing because you're tied currently.

And I can confirm looking online it is a Swiss global provider.

Thank you for the point.

Oh, wow.

Unannounced victory.

Unannounced victory corner.

We were talking about Nokia, weren't we?

Yeah.

Oh, God.

No.

They're finished, by the way.

Yeah, it's all the same.

All the same.

Okay.

You heard it here first.

The global show that Andrew apparently represents and pushes.

You're all the same.

You're all the same.

All Scandies.

But not in a good way, apparently.

All Scandies.

No one's listening anymore anyway after the last 10 minutes.

People are very confused.

Andrew's freezing again.

He's frozen.

So we're going to go on to super quick watch follow-up.

Yeah.

So last episode, you may recall, I was talking about being watchless because I was doing the whole Apple Watch battery service.

And I can confirm, as you said, Jason, that it's a whole watch swap.

It's not just the battery because we're not in a world of Mr. Minute kiosks.

I don't know.

Is Mr. Minute a thing in the US?

You know those watch kiosks?

Must be in Australia.

No, but we have those.

They're a dime a dozen.

There's 50 million different little kiosks.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I assumed it was an Australian thing, but you know what I'm talking about.

So it's really just, you know, it's not like the old world.

You go in, they give you a new watch.

And to my understanding from the person at the counter at this premium service provider,

they said that they have like a different line, apparently.

That was what they were speculating, where the watches that aren't for retail but are for the service swaps are put aside for different generations.

So when you go in and have the approved swap, they give you that.

So it's a way of just having that stock there.

They said, don't quote me on it, but that's what they think.

Sounds like you chatted with somebody at a counter.

Yeah.

This is kind of like a follow-up counter chat.

So Andrew, edit this or apply artwork as you wish.

You're right, Jason.

Yeah.

So I just thought I'd say, look, very happy.

I've technically paid for a new old watch.

It's like it was when I first got it.

I'm happy to have done it in a way that is apparently more sustainable.

I was checking like series six environmental PDFs on the website to see that apparently things go back into the supply chain.

And that's how they do their whole hundred percent recycled dot, dot, dot.

For aluminum and steel and so forth.

So anyway, just a message to say, even though I was a bit annoyed about having to wait a full week, it's a good result.

And if you have an Apple watch out there that needs a battery service, and that's really the only thing that's kind of stopping you from enjoying it.

You don't want to spend on a new one.

Service the battery, get a new watch, return that material to the supply chain.

And great.

You've saved some money on not having to buy a new watch.

And that's my update.

Andrew is frozen again.

No, no, no, no.

No.

It's the worst our internet has ever been.

While we're on counter chat, I just need to mention that I had to have a medical procedure this week.

No big deal.

No big deal.

But an opportunity to spend a few hours in a hospital, which is excellent because I got to have a bit of sedative.

You know, when you only have a procedure and they just put you to sleep.

It's the best sleep you could ever wish for.

I love it.

Love it.

This is not a medical show.

We do not provide any advice or just pure entertainment.

Karen Andrew.

But none of that is really the point.

The point is, for whatever reason, I was in a really jolly mood.

And I was counter chatting everybody in that hospital.

Nurses, the surgeon, other doctors, other patients.

I was in the waiting room at the end of the thing, like just waiting to check out.

And I chatted to another patient.

Found out that she was going to celebrate by going to Hungry Jack's afterwards.

To celebrate getting through her procedure.

Just counter chat everywhere.

It was so fun.

I was laughing with the doctor in the operating area.

It was great.

Loved it.

Counter chat.

Highly recommended.

While they were cutting you open, you were just, this is the best.

And you were just laughing.

I was chatting.

And then the sedative kicked in.

Do you know what I think I've learned from this, Jason?

With Andrew.

Because I know, Jason, you're not the counter chat participant.

I'm just going to keep talking because Andrew is just freezing.

I was just going to say, Jason, what I've learned from counter chat.

Today, because you're not so much a participant of it, which is fine, obviously.

Andrew, to get to my level of counter chat has to be heavily drugged.

Yeah.

Heavily sedated.

Like my extraversion is so extreme, apparently, that it's equivalent to being on sedatives or something.

You should try it, Jason.

Counter chat is, it's excellent.

Get on board.

I can't wait to hear about it when this episode comes out.

Is my internet that bad?

It's frozen again.

Okay.

So I'm just going to push on.

Andrew, please insert Turbo Media Corner.

You just heard the Turbo Media Corner theme.

Are we releasing this?

Are we actually going to release this?

This is...

Yes, we are.

This is a shit show.

This is the worst.

It's fine.

This is absolutely terrible.

I don't even want to hear it.

And I'm here.

So bad.

What's happened?

I think there's a tariff on our internet connection.

If you pull this edit off, you're a magician.

Turbo Media Corner?

Okay.

So Turbo Media Corner.

So I'm bringing something weird and different.

Well, it's not weird if you're a parent and apparently you bought this because it was very popular as a Christmas gift in 2024.

It's the Yoto Mini.

Do either of you know about Yoto players?

Never heard of a Yoto player.

No.

What does that do?

Here we go.

So this is a little thing that Natasha organized as a bit of a family group gift for Mac.

You know, I've got different relatives involved.

Thank you.

You know who you are if you're listening.

Thank you so much.

Mainly my mum and sister with some other relatives thrown in.

Basically, it is a physical media player for kids.

And the Yoto Mini, it's like this little cube with very cute little orange knobs and dials on it.

And you drop cards into it that do kids' audio books, music, etc.

And you can buy the cards.

And you can buy the cards based on age range or what's most appropriate for your child.

And then they sell little sleeves and folders and stuff to store the cards.

There are competitors to the Yoto, but they kind of have less, I suppose, efficiently stored figurines and things that drop on top.

This is just like a little card player, smaller than what you would have had with old world cassettes and stuff.

And I wanted to throw it out as a bit of a turbo media corner thing because we've been able to get him some of his favorite books, things that he loves adapted from TV shows.

And given that we're in this world of.

Internet saturation.

You know, we started this episode with things like, you know, the influence of global social media networks and all of those algorithmic feeds and, you know, politics and how that bleeds into it.

This is just a really fun, super cute device that you could buy for yourself, I suppose, if you like kids books.

But something that keeps kids from toddler age through primary school away from all of that crap, but really entertained.

Mac loves this thing and will just sit listening to it probably for longer than he would stay engaged with television.

And it's really, really good.

So I suppose my media antidote for anyone listening, whether you're a parent or no kids in the family, check out the Yoto player as a fun way of staying away from the Internet.

I love this.

I want one of these.

Yeah, I was going to say he was Jason's going to buy his orange.

It's a device.

And he made a commitment not to buy any stupid devices for himself over a year.

So he's buying it.

This is perfect.

Yeah, I have two questions.

Go for it.

Is it the Yoto player or the Yoto mini?

We got him the mini.

We got him the mini.

Okay.

Follow up question.

I mean, this thing, it looks like a little weird teenage engineering device.

So yeah.

Yay.

Follow up question to actually have three questions, but I'm only allowed to say I have two.

What do the two knobs do?

I assume one is volume and one is some kind of fast forward.

Or rewind.

Yeah.

So it's actually really intelligent the way that they've designed the cards.

So the cards, like if I suppose if you were to drop water on them, I don't think that'd

be affected.

But all of this stuff is integrated in interfaces with the device.

So when you turn those knobs, it'll do volume up and down.

It will skip forwards and backwards and chapters.

And although it's not driven around a screen like an iPhone or an iPad or a Kindle or something

might be, that little screen down the bottom will reflect things like checking battery

status when you tap the side button.

You tap the side button that turns it on and off.

It will show a little icon that denotes the chapter or whatever's going on in the story.

And when you click them in, it will also do things like playing and pausing.

So the knobs or those dolls also click in in a kind of sort of like a satisfactory mushy

clicky way for kids.

Okay.

Two more questions.

What are the cards and can we put this podcast onto one of those cards?

Okay.

And then the second one is, does it support lossless phones?

Does it support lossless flack playback?

I don't know about lossless flack to be honest.

Okay.

Okay.

Because that's all I care about anymore.

But when you buy the player, I might be wrong because Natasha looked into this bit more

than I have for the show.

When you get it, you start off with at least a card that has some instructions and you

can put stuff on.

And to my understanding, you can get extra cards that you could record your own voice.

So for example, if your child really liked a book that isn't available, you could read

a book in your own voice.

And have it available for them to play through the speaker or supported just oxen headphones.

So technically, yes, if I were a really cruel parent, I could put hemispheric views on Max

Yoto Mini.

That you must.

That's the only way we're releasing this show from now on is on Yoto Minis.

That's it.

Sorry.

And look, it is actually phone enabled.

So if you need to do something at a distance as a parent, you can have the Yoto app and

control it through your phone.

But that's really just an extra thing.

The idea is that a kid can play Yoto.

The idea is that a kid sits down and twiddles the knobs themselves.

When I was a kid, I would always listen to books on tape.

That was my thing.

I would go to sleep every night listening to a book on tape.

And one of my favorite books that I would listen to again and again and again was one

called Milly Molly Mandy.

So can you just check the catalog and see if you can find Milly Molly Mandy for the

Yoto, in which case I will buy it and I will listen again to that wonderful story.

I'm not going to hold my breath, but I will check for you.

No.

Hypothetically, One Prime Plus episodes are only released on Yoto cards that are mailed

to you via postal service.

And the only way you can hear them is via a Yoto Mini.

What if that were the world we lived in?

Well, I've just checked the website and apparently this is an Australian pricing for $39.99.

You can get a pack of 10.

Make your own cards.

So yeah, this sounds like a very useful and cost efficient subscription service to have

Hemispheric Views sent on Yoto cards.

Do you have a referral code, Martin?

I don't know about that yet.

Sorry, I haven't got the whole slash save thing in my life like you do.

So maybe if you jump on before I do, I don't know.

What are these cards?

They hold 100 tracks or 500 megabytes each.

This is incredible.

They're very impressive and it's super thin.

It's like having a desk.

It's like having a debit or credit card, but without that embossing or the raised letters on it.

It's very, very clever.

And they just look totally flush and they just look like something that could fit in your wallet.

They have the Gruffalo.

I love that story.

Yeah, we got him that stuff.

He loves the Julia Donaldson books.

Yeah, they're great.

But look, even if you're listening, you're going, why do they keep talking about this stuff for kids?

The main message here is like Jason, right, with his iPod, the Mod Pod thing, try to find a way to, you know, detach a bit.

Maybe you've got some physical media at home that you've kind of neglected.

This is like retro physical media reborn into an efficient, you know, fun way for kids.

But anyone listening to this can adapt something in their life to fit this style.

I'm going to do the math and see what it's going to cost us per week if we transition every listener of the regular show over to Yoto cards.

I'll do the math on that and we'll see where we end up.

So that was Turbo Media Corner.

So turbo.

So fast.

Do you want a turbo photography corner?

Sure.

Why not?

Turbo it up.

Okay.

Very quick.

Yeah, this is a gift that I received from Natasha for my birthday.

And I have to say, Natasha is like a great creative gift mind.

She just knows cool stuff to find.

And the thing that I'm going to show you, check out the links and show notes listeners or even artwork.

Depends what Andrew feels like doing after editing.

The Dispo lens.

I have chucked it here on my Olympus EPM one or pen mini camera.

And the Dispo lens is essentially a 3D printed body cap lens made by Dispo Studio.

It's what they call themselves in Switzerland.

There we go.

Switzerland again after Loggi.

And what it is, it's the disposable lens from like a camera disposable camera put in this 3D printed mount to give you the look of disposable cameras on your camera.

She got me the Micro Four Thirds mount.

And as far as I'm aware from what I've read, it's a 28 millimeter equivalent lens.

But when you do the two times crop factor magnification for Micro Four Thirds, which I use, that would be what, 56.

So it's a little bit tighter than the standard 50 millimeter focal length, which ultimately I prefer, I think, to having a wide one.

That's just my style.

But I've really been enjoying using this.

And in a similar vein to what I was just saying earlier, I've been using this for a long time.

And in a similar vein to what I was just saying about the Oto Mini, doing things that give you that older style or a retreat from perfection or the digital, it's been really fun just walking around taking deliberately, I suppose you could say, crappy looking disposable photos at a really tight aperture.

It's like F11 with this old camera that I have.

And you can check the links and show notes as well to see what it's like.

I've started on Glass just a little series called Disposable Adventures.

And it's great.

You just chuck some different filters or LUTs on them.

I'm not normally a big filter guy in photography.

I like to make it look as much like what I see in the scene in front of my eyes.

But it's been really fun doing this because it's already altering reality even more than usual.

And it just slides in the pocket.

So, yeah, if you're looking for another weird gift idea beyond Christmas or birthdays or something, Dispo Lens for your amount of choice.

Check it out.

I love that photo you've taken with the hazard tape.

That is a great photo.

In the shop.

I'm excited.

They made that one easy for me.

It was just so quirky.

You need to go back and see what I want to see the new layout when it is complete.

Oh, at the shop, Lincraft.

Yeah, you know, haberdashery, kids craft.

It's probably something like crochet your own scene from, you know, like a 19th century painting or something.

This is great.

I want one of these.

Can I have one of these?

You're costing Jason a lot of money today.

This thing's like pretty cheap.

I think it was like around 50 to 70 Australian dollars, somewhere in that price range.

I just saw Jason highlighting that the time timer on our HV Mini show has come to a conclusion.

It has.

Well, it has.

And we've covered every single topic amazingly in the time except for one, basketball.

Do you want to do it really quickly, Andrew?

Yeah, I can do it really quick.

I went to a comic book shop last week.

I've never really gone into a comic book shop before.

Because I've never really been a comic book guy.

But I bought...

Never?

No.

Not even in the past?

No, no, no.

It's a lie.

It's a lie.

I liked Garfield.

I liked The Far Side.

And I liked Archie.

Okay.

I bought a comic book, Strange Adventures.

I quite enjoyed reading it.

I also bought a Mad magazine, which featured Crocodile Dundee.

And I bought that because it was so Hemispheric Views related.

I enjoyed that.

It was...

I mean, I had read Mad magazines before as well when I was a kid.

I particularly always liked the folding at the back.

So, it was good to sort of look at that again.

Although, a little...

Like, age probably the...

You know, kind of hasn't made the jokes better, let's say.

Some were a little problematic.

So, this was an old issue.

But yeah, what I've discovered with comics...

Yes.

Yes, it was an old issue.

It was in their discount bargain bin.

Yep.

But the comic book I did read, Strange Adventures, I quite enjoyed it.

But the one thing that I've come to realize about comics is I don't like all the superhero stuff.

And I wish comics were more normal.

Like, I wish they just told normal drama stories with normal people without superpowers and stuff.

I think that would be more relatable.

Well, speaking of comic books, Andrew, I don't know if you're still speaking because you keep freezing.

But...

Oh, no, wait.

You're finished.

Speaking of comic books, like, you just said Strange Adventures.

Why don't you make a comic book around your own strange adventures in life?

And I don't mean, like, it doesn't have to be huge and take up all your time.

But Craig, my manager, who I've mentioned on the show, he's actually used things like Comic Life before.

You know that app that used to come with Macs back in the day?

Like Mac OS Tiger and all that sort of stuff.

Plask.

Plask or something made that.

Something like that.

Okay.

Is that what it was?

I've forgotten the name.

But yeah, Comic Life.

I've forgotten the name.

But yeah, Comic Life.

I've forgotten the name.

But yeah, Comic Life.

I've forgotten the name.

But yeah, Comic Life.

I've forgotten the name.

But yeah, Comic Life.

I've forgotten the name.

But yeah, Comic Life.

I've forgotten the name.

But yeah, Comic Life.

I've forgotten the name.

But yeah, Comic Life.

I've forgotten the name.

But yeah, Comic Life.

I've forgotten the name.

But yeah, Comic Life.

I've forgotten the name.

Oh, well, it's been a good last episode, guys.

I appreciate the 131.

And hopefully we'll still talk in the future.

And look, all those listeners

who came streaming in from Connected

will not be disappointed.

I just, I think we've done them a service,

to be perfectly fair.

Like, if you came over,

you knew right away to just fucking uninstall right now.

Like, you didn't have to wait 15, 30 episodes

or, you know, 40 hours of content.

You knew in the first three minutes

this was not for you, so you bailed.

It's perfect.

It's the best way we could have done it.

Gotta listen to episode 97 anyway.

That thing, oh, anyway.

Three, two, one.

Stop.

I don't even know what's happening anymore.
