Welcome to episode 96 of Hemispheric views nudging closer to episode 100.
I was a little disappointed I wasn't on 100 sorry I wanted to do already.
That's really rude.
Oh no.
Did you not shut up for a while?
You didn't get the memo.
You get a guest in and it just ruins my intro.
That the dulcet tones the dulcet Irish, British tones.
Northern English.
Yes from Sunderland.
Sunderland.
I don't even know where that is.
We've got other Rob will be able to help us out with that one.
Yeah, that voice is none other than Johnny decimal Noble.
Who is famous in our corners of the internet for developing a filing system.
Yes, that's what we do.
What a strange thing to be to be kind of internet famous for as well a filing system.
I never thought if you'd asked me when I was a kid, I didn't there's no where I thought I'd be.
This is really having you on the show is kind of like I previously had we had the author of the BOS Bible Scott Hacker who joined us on the show once
and that was my own sort of spirit quest because I used to love BOS having you on the show is another one of my spirit quests because I've been on a filing adventure for the last.
How long have I been using computers 30 years maybe you know about my pursuits with Devin Jimbo.
Oh my God.
How could we not are you a Devin think person?
I am a Devin think person.
I have been a Jimbo person.
I'm currently a keep it person.
Oh God never heard of that one.
I am just trying to find the ultimate solution and Jason keeps telling me just use the finder man.
It's true.
He just he all he does is find places to put shit and then never goes back to it and then just finds a new system and he refuses to acknowledge that the finder is the key.
Yep.
Just where's where's your stuff?
I literally lost the document yesterday.
I've got to admit it.
I had to I know I know I had to go back and like dig it out of email.
I'm so sorry.
I felt like a massive failure.
I didn't know which of my seven systems I'd put it into so that's it.
See it's the people with all of these systems that are the ones that lose stuff the people that just have crap all over their desktop.
They somehow know that the fourth column third file is the one they want.
I don't know how they know but they do.
Yeah, it's it's funny when you know cuz I'm thinking about that.
I've realized since since so Johnny Decimal's an idea.
It's been around for about 10 odd years.
I actually quit my job earlier this year to to be Johnny Decimal.
I used to have a job as an IT contractor and I came home one day.
It was actually a Sunday night just before I went to work and I said to my partner Lucy, can I just not go?
I really don't like it anymore.
Can I not do this anymore?
Because I'd kind of realized that Johnny Decimal was had reached a level of awareness.
I guess that it was this thing on the internet and that if I didn't take advantage of it now, then when was I ever going to do that?
You know, and I mean, I'm you know, I think we all you know, who wants a job job, right?
I'd rather not have a job job.
And so anyway, so since then that was earlier this year and since then I've had a few realizations about this thing and one of them is that it's actually a bit less about your file system.
Although of course, that's such a key thing for most people what it is is about having an index of your stuff because then it doesn't matter where your stuff is.
If you don't if your habit isn't to necessarily go to your file system first, although 90% of the time that's going to work.
But if your habit is to go to your index first and then your index can tell you it might be in like what was Lucy's example the other day.
She uses Canva for design.
The thing you're looking for might be in Canva.
And so the Johnny Decimal index is the place that you go and then it tells you it points you in different directions and says, hey, it's on your Dropbox or it's in your Synology or it's in Canva or whatever, right?
And that's kind of one of the realizations I've had of late.
That's more what it is.
That's really interesting to me because that's exactly my problem.
There are so many places in which you can store stuff and so much stuff is online in an online service somewhere now.
They're not just files and folders and .docx things anymore.
Or it's in your email.
I mean, if you're at work, one of the things in my last job, it was the first place that I'd use Teams in anger.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
Here we go.
Oh my lord.
He said it.
He said the T word.
Just a can of worms has opened.
Jeebus grievous.
It's wild, man.
Like how every... I've got a video in my head and it's so hard to try and figure out how to represent this.
But in the old world, it's like go back 20 years, right?
We all look about the same age, near enough.
I remember you had a G drive, right?
You're at work and you had a G drive.
And the G drive was madness, but at least there was only one G drive.
You could find it because it was on the G drive, more or less.
And now these days, you've got SharePoint and everybody just gets a new SharePoint group.
You've got Teams and every team has a document library in SharePoint where a thing could be.
Every individual chat has a document library in SharePoint where a document could possibly be.
All the information you're looking for might just be in the chat because somebody's just dropped a table in there, right?
In my old nerd world, what's the change request number for the DNS change, right?
Boring details, but you're like, there's not just one place you have to find it.
There's now dozens of places where the thing could be before you even start to look down the tree.
It's insane.
So, do you know the most of that?
The other thing that drives me crazy while I'm just going to do my Teams rant is not only you've got all those problems you've just outlined.
You need to do it all in one single window.
So, there's no concept of looking at two different directories at one time or anything like that.
It's like single window.
So, there's no, it's very annoying.
And then you close something and it jets you back to the root directory or something like that.
It's horrible.
It's truly atrocious.
And that's now, I mean, in my last job, I live in Canberra.
So, you know, it was for a large government department.
And you just see people all day.
You've got these people.
This is what everybody does at work now.
Everybody just sits and stares at Teams and tries to find stuff all day long.
Nobody, nobody knows where anything is anymore.
It's absolutely absurd.
Yeah.
So, that's the problem I'm trying to fix.
It might not be the most glamorous one in the world.
I'm strangely passionate about it.
That's, it's what I've got.
It's safe to say he probably wouldn't be here if I would have sent him a Teams link for this rant.
Probably just delete the email and move on.
Well, one of the other things when I quit my job earlier this year, because I didn't really have a plan for what I was going to do.
I don't really still have much of a plan.
I thought, well, because I just finished this corporate job.
I thought, well, I can see people using Teams.
I can see nobody can find anything.
I thought, I'll write some Teams software.
I actually, because I'm a little bit of a developer, not really.
And so I downloaded Teams and I got Lucy who sits just, you know, three feet over there.
I got her on Teams and so the two of us are on Teams at work during the day.
And I tried starting to code stuff in Teams.
Oh.
And I do not know if any of you have tried that before, but dear good heavens, that is an absolute shambles.
What do you mean by that?
That's kind of baffling.
Well, that's a good question.
I mean, even to start to get into the Microsoft world, because of course everything's on Azure now.
It's all platform and even to figure out where to start to try and get anything up, because I actually thought, oh, Teams, brilliant.
It handles authentication for me because that's the way I don't want to have to deal with user accounts, right?
You're signed into Teams.
So surely it's easy.
I just get this platform and I can do things.
It was mind-bogglingly complex and it's now dropped.
Thank goodness.
I don't have to think about it anymore.
But yeah, it's a weird thing they've built and it's, you know, it's what we've got.
It's what everybody uses all day at work.
And yeah.
Well, speaking of Teams, like I now have what is called Microsoft Teams Classic on my computer.
Have you seen this?
Because they've got a new one.
What's that now?
And you're supposed to have a toggle in it up the top that gives you the new Teams experience.
But I don't see a toggle there.
And when you download the latest one, it says, here you go, the latest one.
It's called Classic.
So I don't know what's going on.
At my work, we use Teams, of course.
And I have a toggle, Martin, and I toggled it and was happily toggled for a couple of weeks.
And then we got an email saying our IT provider has said that you shouldn't be using the new one.
Stick to the old one because it's not completely ready yet.
And there are some, whatever.
Yeah.
The new Teams is not compatible with Windows 95.
That's a shame.
I dutifully toggled back, but I don't notice any incompatibilities other than it's crap in both instances.
Crap Classic and crap new.
Perfect.
So here we are, Hemisphere Reviews, talking Johnny Sinclair, talking Microsoft Teams.
Is this everything you hoped it would be, John?
It's business corner of more.
This is more.
I've infused business corner already successfully.
Damn it.
So, Johnny, maybe you can give us a bit of a rundown.
So if somebody's never heard of Johnny Decimal and they're thinking, they're listening to this podcast and they're thinking, well, I don't use Teams.
How can this system help me?
Yep.
You're winning already.
Yeah, good question.
So here's how I think about it is that, and again, these are kind of recent realizations from being able to have the space to think about this.
So the first realization actually came from watching the original British The Office, which was from 2001.
And on one of the episodes, David Brent is showing the new girl around the office and they've still got big CRT monitors, right?
The big old, you know, television style monitors.
And he says to her, oh, we've got email here.
Have you used email?
And she's like, yeah, I've used email.
But I thought back in 2001, which is really not that long ago at all, having email was a bit kind of new and special and the computers were really slow and you couldn't really store, you couldn't really create that much stuff if you tried, right?
We didn't all have thousands and thousands of documents on our computers.
A lot of us didn't have computers at home.
We certainly didn't all carry them around in our pockets.
So fast forward 20 and a bit years, and that's utterly changed.
Everything we do now is on a computer and I had a lovely email conversation with a lady called Sharon who lives in Melbourne, actually, who is a sound artist and she plugs cables into these 1960s retro synths, coolest thing in the world.
And she's makes all cool sounds.
And yet even that now, of course, the output of that is a computer file.
Everything now, even if your hobby is analog synths from the 1960s, everything is a computer.
And in those 20 years, none of us have been given any sort of training.
None of us have been given any tools or systems to manage this stuff.
In some of my little videos online, I say the idea of like back in the day, we had these things called filing cabinets and everybody organized people used to file things in them in a structured way so they could find things again.
And that was a job.
That was a thing that people were trained in filing things to find them again.
And now here we are.
Everything is a computer.
Everything you do, you cannot avoid it being on the computer and people have just got no idea what to do.
People's stuff is just thrown onto the computer and then they can never find it again, which is boring and stressful and they don't want to do this.
They don't want to manage their computer files.
That's not unlike some of the weird nerds here.
That's not their hobby.
And so that's what the idea of Johnny Decimal, it's got numbers in it, which I'll explain in a second.
But the more I think about it, the more I realize its power is actually in what it limits you from doing.
Because what it does is imagine your computer, imagine your storage space is your garage.
And so in your garage, you know, you don't just throw all your stuff in the garage.
What we're going to do is we're going to buy you 10 storage shelves and each one of those storage shelves is for an area of your life.
So let's just take the obvious one, your life admin, right?
Your health, your travel, your insurance, all that sort of boring stuff, tax returns.
So on each of these 10 shelves, each of them can store up to 10 boxes.
And just think of those boring cardboard archive boxes, right?
And so each box is going to contain all of the stuff to do with some particular category of your life.
So you're going to put your finance in one box.
You're going to put your travel receipts and coupons in another box and so on and so forth, right?
If you've got a hobby, that's another box.
And so you've got at most 10 shelves and this translates directly to your file system.
So when you come into your file system in a Johnny Decimal structure, you have at most and you try and use less because it's better.
You've got at most 10 folders.
So you got at most 10 decisions, unlike a file system where you come in and there are just, you know, we've all seen them at work.
Dozens, if not hundreds of folders at the top level, named by the alphabet, by the way, which is strangely useless.
For this because the alphabet is really ambiguous, right?
Did you call it finance?
Did you call it accounts?
Did you call it budget?
Right?
People forget what things were called all the time and one person calls it one thing and then someone else can't find the thing they'd call it and they create another thing and I got two things.
So at the very top level, we've got 10 folders.
We call them your areas and they're like your storage shelves.
So that's like an area of your life.
And then in each of those, you've got at most 10 more folders and again, try and use less if you can.
And so now we've got categories.
These are the archive boxes.
And then finally in these folders is where you start to put things.
So this is where you start to put your tax returns, where you start to put your travel receipts.
It's where you start to put the audio files from your cool 1960s synth.
And that's finally the Johnny Decimal ID.
And so I won't talk about numbers here because it's not very visual.
You can read about them on the website, but basically you end up with this shallow structure and that's key.
It's key that it's shallow and it's key that at each decision point, you've got at most 10 at the beginning and then you've got at most 10 again.
And now you are where you need to be.
You're in a category.
You're looking for your travel.
Now you're in the travel category.
It only took you two jumps to get there.
And now in my system, I give you a hundred IDs of things.
So you might have a hundred trips or a hundred tax returns or something.
And then those things get numbers, which like I say, is kind of cool and interesting.
You can use the numbers for other things.
You can use them as a reference, but I think they're not as important as that simple structure, that simple limitation.
And that's kind of it really.
That's the idea at its most basic.
And like I was just chatting to the guys just before the show there, what I've realized now is that you shouldn't think about your file system as the first place to go because now you don't just have a file system.
We used to have a file system.
It was your computer.
It was your Windows 95, right?
It was the only one.
You didn't have a cloud.
Good old days.
You didn't store things in your email.
Yeah, good old days, right?
When things were in one place, you had a file system.
Now your files can be any way.
They could be on your Dropbox.
They can be on your iCloud drive.
They could be on an external drive.
If you've created an archive, it might be in your email, might be in some online service.
And so now what I'm really thinking more about is trying to encourage people to build an index of their stuff with this two-level hierarchy.
And then the index tells you where the thing is.
So you might think where's that art file that I was working on last week and you go to your index and you find the ID that represents the thing you're working on and there it tells you, oh, it's in Canva, some online tool or it's on your iCloud drive or it's in your email or it could be some printed thing.
Less so these days, but yeah, and so it's like an index for your life.
I've got to think of some cool slogan, but I have a potentially.
Yeah, dumb and simple question here.
Okay.
So everything is is Johnny decimalized at this point.
Where does this index live?
Where is that zero point live that I go to well and we call it so the numbers you end up with two numbers like one two dot three four one two is the category that comes before the decimal.
So everything before the decimal gives your system its structure, but we don't store anything up there.
We don't store anything not in a box and then after the decimal is zero to a hundred and that's just your IDs.
That's your things now.
So 00.00 actually is what I would recommend as the number of the index file because it's the very first thing.
It's right up at the top couple of options.
I use bear just a simple notes.
I know.
I know not you to finish Andrew.
It's just it's just an it's just a nice little note up.
It's very pleasant.
It's but you know, any notes at the simple note will do it right Apple notes will do it any of these notes apps will do it.
You just need a notes app where you can create notes because then the beauty I used to use did anyone use rest off notes on Windows back in the day.
Now, I remember hearing out of it.
No real janky little app, but man, it was quick.
It was so quick and it just it just did the barest of notes and it was absolutely perfect for this because you just need something that you can create and search really really fast.
So I use bear because it's faster than Apple notes to search.
Well, apparently bear does make the barest of notes.
Well, what do you know?
What else do you need?
I know.
How did I know that was going to come from that corner of the room?
Is that not the company slogan?
Is that what they use?
What's your beef with bear?
There's no real beef.
It's no real beef.
I don't like it.
It's quite it's quite nice.
I don't know.
I've just I think I went I went deep on bear for a while and then I don't know.
It just didn't stick.
Andrew just likes to put guests and listeners into their place.
That's it.
Loyal bearists.
I mean anything will work right?
Simple not will work.
And of course that's cross-platform Apple notes will work.
I personally don't like it that much but you know, whatever it'll work Andrew if you'd rather put a post-it note on the bottom of your computer like that's fine too a post-it note would work.
And so I either use bear and I just create one note per index entry and so the note is the entry and the note just starts with the ID 1 2.3 4 and then the name of the thing and then just below there.
I put location and where it is if necessary.
And then of course the advantage is now if you want to keep notes about that thing, it's just in bear already just add them to the note.
Sometimes the ID is just the notes.
You don't actually have a file sometimes.
That's another thing trying to stop people from discouraging.
I'm going to keep saying normal people because I'm really trying to put my mind in people who aren't tech nerds.
And that's one of the reasons I recommend bear actually rather than for example notion, which I've been looking at recently.
But I mean, I'm an IT professional of 30 years and when I first opened notion, I was like, whoa, like what is this thing?
It's really complicated.
Whereas bears not it's just simple.
It's easy and that's all you need here.
You just need simple easy notes.
The other option is you could keep everything in a single text file just indented like in a hierarchy if you would prefer.
I don't do that.
But if you did that you could use some you could probably write little text tools to query that if you had a simple structured text file, you could write yourself a little shell script or something to do things with that if you wanted to but I tend not to or third option.
You could use a database air table notion something like that.
I have to say that as someone who's never used your system before Andrew is much more familiar with it than I am.
I can't really speak for Jason.
I know that when I was in school, I was meticulous about keeping my files in order all folders named alphabetically as you kind of referred to there.
And then the moment that the iPhone came in as a concept with things like Apple Notes as that initial default things like the I disk through to iCloud Drive.
You mentioned can for you know other things online it entirely broke the logic of that structure and where everything was and everything sprawled and I can't remember where things are.
But just I suppose for other listeners who might be thinking I've had that kind of thing happen as well or mobile kind of broke all of that up.
I'm really kind of getting it now.
And I think as well with this feels so trivial because it's so common.
It's so it's like what's the files on my computer.
What are you talking about?
But I think that's part of the problem.
And it's like I think we have to recognize that this is a hard problem.
It sounds trivial and you're like it's hard.
So I'm a seven my files is hard.
What are you talking about?
But it is being organized and saving your files is difficult and Johnny decimal requires work.
It's not you know, it's not free as an effort like you have to do some work.
You have to keep this index people are like I've got a keeping do or what keep an index.
But of course you do, you know, if you want to be able to find stuff again, you I think that you have to put in the work and have some sort of system to organize them.
So many of these systems I think are on the surf.
They I mean they flat-out lie to us when we start many of these systems that you don't have to organize.
You just throw your crap in here and like it's going to be fine.
You're going to be able to find it just search and it's like I search but they fail to realize that our brains are so dumb and will rename the same file 80 different things each time.
Totally.
You're searching for tax return and you named it something completely different.
So it doesn't really help.
Yeah, a hundred percent.
And I mean, you know, I know no Gmail is probably the most famous for just search your email and you know, I guess it works right but on a man.
I mean on a Mac you can but again back to the workplace.
You just can't do that at work share like SharePoint search just doesn't work your stuffs in so many different places.
Anyway, you forgot what you named the thing.
I mean, I've been with people who are good at searching their email and Outlook at work and we're there like I know the thing exists and you just can't find it because you're right.
You just you thought it happened last year and it was the year before you thought some person was included in the conversation and they weren't and you thought you named it one thing and you named it something subtly different.
So yeah, that's that's the thing.
I think if you were and I've been in past jobs where I've meticulously filed everything because it was kind of my job in a previous job.
I was one of the reasons I was hired and to be able to just find something in me or immediately is kind of a superpower these days.
Yeah, but like I say, I can't stress enough.
It requires work.
I used to spend 10% of my day filing stuff.
Even if I have a John at my job doing that 24 hours a day making everything perfectly organized.
That doesn't mean I know how you organized it.
So doesn't mean I'm going to be able to find it either.
Right?
But with like something like the system you just say a number and numbers equal numbers.
Yeah, you can either just say say the number to somebody which is really handy for like reading it over the phone or just explaining where something is.
You don't have to like talk somebody through a file path.
You can just say it's that 31.17, which is really really nice.
The reason I came up with it was because I hated the old Windows file path where you printed on the footer of a document that you print out and you stick on the wall.
So you can find C colon backslash user tilde one slash.
You know, like this is our my docu tilde.
It didn't take long for the backslash to come up though.
I have to say because that's been on the show before.
The bar.
Yeah.
Yeah, but if you can just write 31.17 in the footer, you know where that thing is again.
Yeah.
So yeah, it's it's it works.
Like I said, it is more effort.
It is more time.
But if you want to find things again, I don't see I don't see these days how you can expect to find things again.
If you're not keeping some sort of index, how do you think it's going to work?
If I put my management consulting head on job that I used to do.
Oh, I used to I used to be that no longer.
Yeah, but it's congratulations.
Thanks.
It strikes me that so much like if this was a manufacturing firm or something basically you're describing a warehousing system and manufacturing companies spend a lot of time and effort optimizing.
A flow path and making sure that skews are on a shelf in a particular location and they can find them quickly and they know exactly how many widgets they have.
So that's part of the production line and in an ordinate amount of effort goes into that and you think about the Toyota production system and lean and all that.
That's yeah.
Optimize optimize optimize develop and build a system that works because that's that's the game right being efficient.
There's all these knowledge workers out there that don't have not put any effort into that whatsoever and it strikes me that what you're describing is basically an efficiency system for knowledge workers.
100%.
And for so long it's just been like oh you just do it.
Yeah, that's not our core business.
You just figure it out and work it out.
But yeah, all this question about how we're going to get more productivity in the workplace and all that.
How many hours are spent losing and finding files?
Yeah, I genuinely think not wanting to big this because this is such a simple idea as well.
Right?
I mean, I came up with it because I wanted prettier numbers in a document footer and then it turned out like this is turns out this has got some value this system and then you know, I'm little Johnny Noble here.
Right?
I'm just some guy in my bedroom surrounded by sheets for sound dampening at the moment.
It still boggles my mind genuinely boggles my mind that this is a thing on the internet that people appreciate and write to me and say thank you.
So it's like it's that's that's mad.
Right?
So with that I actually think that if everybody did something like this we could make the world and I don't want to turn this into a TED talk.
Right?
But I think we could make the world 1% more efficient.
Yeah, I genuinely do because I've been in jobs recently earlier this year where I've been in the place and I've watched people all day long just not find stuff or worse find the wrong thing find an old thing find the wrong information.
That's has since been updated and now you go off on some Merry Path doing something with some data, which is wrong or you send some old version of a document out to the customer and you look like an idiot and like it's just it's so prevalent and it's so common because everything's on a computer.
I'm going to play devil's advocate for one second.
John.
I feel like there's one thing that you're sort of ruining with your system and that is the fact that we are no longer going to have final final V to final final JB underscore to final W W F F final final.
No really final like we're going to lose that brackets and zero zero two.
Yeah, and I just feel like that's kind of what you're somewhat creating a disservice to the entire world not having to see that anymore.
So how do you feel about that?
It is a tragic loss.
There's nothing I can do about it.
Please feel free to just met name things copy of copy of final of final.
It's funny because it's true.
You see I have a question rather hard-hitting and will probably derail this whole conversation.
But you know, that's what happens on this show you come across as a very and I mean this positively meticulous organized knowledge management kind of guy Andrew likes you I can tell.
Oh, absolutely.
But are you this meticulous and organized with things elsewhere in your life that may not have to do with the computer.
I am now if my old flatmate ever hears this he'd be on the ground laughing because I used to be I mean, I'm 47 now.
Right?
So I think I think we all just get a bit older and get a bit more tidy in my old flat when I used to live in the center of Melbourne with my mate Ryan.
Hi Ryan.
We had these two big drawers in the kitchen.
Mine was the top drawer and his was the bottom drawer and the agreement was that if you thought your flatmate was being untidy you could just scoop all of their things into the drawer.
And so all of my things were in the drawer everything I owned was in that drawer and I just rummaged through this drawer until I found the thing that I needed.
But now I'm strangely organized.
Yeah, my drawers are neat in the house.
My garage is neat.
I don't have too many things.
Yeah, it's funny you say that about the drawers because I was going to build on Martin's question by asking what is the third drawer in your kitchen like?
Neat.
To my mind the third the kitchen third drawer is always the one where it's like a random for whatever reason third drawer.
We're pretty tidy.
It helps Lucy my partner's very very tidy.
So I came into this relationship probably not so much but I've since I've been taught the value of being more tidy.
Do you have foam cutouts in your drawers?
My top drawer here has got a little like here things where you put your pencils.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
Yes.
See it popped into my brain to ask you because you mentioned opening that magical box in the garage and everything is organized and I thought oh, I wonder if these boxes are like that.
My garage boxes are quite well organized.
Yes.
I've got six or seven and they've all yeah, they're all they've all got the right things in them.
Very impressive.
You're only allowed to have 10.
Well 10 per shelf.
But yes, we've got a small garage.
So it's not there's not that much of that hard-hitting question number two.
Okay, you mentioned I think I heard was it Lucy?
Yes.
Okay.
Now anyone who makes stuff there's always this inherent thing of okay, you make a thing you're passionate about it.
Do the people closest to you resonate with it or care or they like you're insane.
I will never use this thing.
How does that work in your household?
Do you have to Johnny decimals going or do you have a Lucy decimal system going?
I have to know.
Well, I'm very lucky.
I've actually um actually works really well because it's nice having Lucy is an ex writer in a highly regulated industry.
So she's got that sort of brain anyway, but she's not really computer II and that really actually helps to have someone to bounce that sort of stuff off.
So she's I mean, she let me quit my job.
So if you can't think the idea is that that bad,
but it's kind of handy because she serves as a good Sending board and if she doesn't understand it,
then I haven't explained it properly.
So she's yeah, she's not in as much as I'm the one who does the decimal link around here,
but we do have yes, she because she's actually working with us since I quit my job.
It is the two of us now actually working on this.
So we've got a you ever got a shed shed Johnny decimal system for the Johnny decimal business and she's she's in on that.
But she asks me questions sometimes.
So when you say like, oh, it's 20 dot 3.
She's like, oh, yeah.
Okay. I know where exactly where that is.
She's all over that sort of thing.
Yeah.
Nice.
Okay.
Yeah, very supportive.
I haven't given her a number yet.
I should label her.
That's where that's where the relationship is goes to the next level.
You get your own number in the system like you've made.
Yep.
Now, what I have in my mind is when the Simpsons go to the Flanders is holiday home and it's just all these posted notes everywhere telling people what to do and where things are.
It's like they open the ice cream train.
It's like fill me with what Ned turns it over with water.
You're putting notes everywhere like that.
Yeah, good.
Well, I'm going to give you a little bit of relationship advice.
Okay, just make sure Lucy is yes is oh 1.01.
That would be my my primary piece of advice for you.
That would make her the inbox tend to use 0 1 for the inbox.
Oh, yeah, baby.
Because you got to have somewhere to put stuff as well.
Right?
So I'm still working all these ideas out.
But yeah, I think I'm setting up common places for you to drop things because the other nice thing about the categories is if you do have an inbox, if you have a thought, yeah, I've got to get this thought.
I've got to put it somewhere.
Then if you put it in the category and I tend to reserve the earlier numbers like 16 or 16 to my travel category.
I was just use that one 16 or 1 might be the inbox for travel and you could just dump things in there.
13 or 1 would be my inbox for finance and you can just dump things in there.
So yeah, I actually start my IDs at 11.
I don't start at 0 1 the website says I do but I think because it's like an advanced thing that I'll tell people later.
I started 11 and I reserve dot 0 1.
I reserve those for like special things up front.
So yes, okay.
I like how you're answering all of my questions ahead of time because I'm a big fan of having an inbox area.
That's sort of like I know it's going to be filed but there's that that period of time where I'm still working on it or kind of figuring out do I even need it?
Maybe I'll just throw it away.
Yeah, before I go down and figure out where it's going to go like just give me somewhere to put stuff.
So that's that's part of your mantra is like have a place to just get stuff captured.
Yeah, so you can figure out where it goes eventually.
Okay.
Yeah, because this I mean, look, you know, we all know GTD.
I think now and that's the thing with this the whole PKM world, which I'm definitely a part of right even even though I don't do backlinks to my own notes.
It's all like we're all trying to find the right idea and a lot of them have already been had like a lot of the GTD stuff that that inbox idea is brilliant.
Right have somewhere you can put something assuming you do the review later, which you never do of course like the someday idea.
I love the Sunday idea put a thing somewhere that you might look at later, but at least you know where it is.
So there's obviously a lot of those kind of common ideas that are that I integrated into Johnny decimal because yeah, they're just good sensible ideas that have already been had, you know,
So you talk about quitting your job and Johnny decimal being your job if people want to support your job like is there a way that they can they can do that?
Yes, so I the first thing we did we actually just because I was doing the team's research and thank goodness that ended because we were going on holiday in August.
Went across to Asia went back to the UK to see my family and we thought well before we go away be good to just have something for sale because you know, otherwise literally nothing's happening and you know,
And so in a couple of weeks there helps that Lucy's a copy editor one of the very common things the questions I get and it's on the forum is obviously how do I this is cool.
This is a great idea.
Right, but how do I set my own thing up?
Right?
How do I make one?
How do I make my own and so it's ended up it's now at a hundred and ten pages, which twenty thousand words, which I never thought would be like it's wild of actual, you know words.
I think I think it's good content.
So we wrote the Johnny decimal workbook just before we went on holiday, which is for sale on the website.
If you go to the website, there's a little thing in the sidebar.
I can't miss it.
Yeah, and that has we released that on the very end of July went on holiday in August and I honestly would have been happy if we'd sold a handful.
I mean I would have been again.
I'm you know, I can't believe people read the website let alone want to buy a thing.
I honestly I like I'm deeply humbled.
That's how we feel about this show.
Don't worry.
Yeah, it's right.
It's it's mad though.
Isn't it when someone likes the thing you did?
Yeah, and so we put it up for sale and within a few minutes a handful of people have bought it.
I went out into the garden.
I said, look some people have bought it.
Can't believe it.
So so yeah, that's pulling in a handful of sales a day, which is which is paying the rent at the moment.
That's really good.
So if you want to the Johnny decimal workbook, it is.
Yeah, really great.
It's 37 American dollars, which is frankly a number.
I just made up because it kind of felt about right.
So as per last week's conversation, that's now about a million Australian dollars.
I was going to say so that converted.
That's yeah about a million and a half.
Yeah, Martin and I are priced out of the marketplace.
Yeah, I'll buy you guys both a copy and I'll send it to you both.
Yeah, I don't think I can afford the book.
It's well, it's good for me because I get paid in the Australian dollars.
So people are buying it in in American.
So that's worked out quite well.
I'm all for the rate going up, right?
I can tell you what it is any dip givens 1.56 is what it is
because I'm acutely aware of the red.
So yeah, that's a sale on the website.
One of the things I'm really keen on doing is so what I'll be doing next is probably some sort of course
because I know people like to you know, see a thing and do a video and all the rest of it.
So I'll do a course.
I am looking at an ocean template because it's actually a pretty handy bit of software.
And one of the things with this might sound cheesy, but I really want it to be true is
when someone's in the Johnny Decimal family, like I try and it's just me.
It's just me and Lucy, right?
So I want to be good.
I want to be a nice corner of the internet.
I don't want to be rubbish.
So, you know, once you're in anything else I do I give out help very healthy discounts to people for all future things.
Like I want kind of people to be, you know, looked after so I don't know what's going to happen in the future.
Probably like I say some sort of course.
Probably not software.
Yeah, don't know but at the moment Johnny Decimal workbook if you buy that for $37 you are paying my rent
and I thank you with the from the bottom of my heart.
Well, I think everybody should get out there and help you out because yeah rent in Australia is not cheap.
Well, yeah, right.
Just to follow up, is there anything that the, you know, we talked about teams and all that.
This strikes me as something right for corporate, you know, roll it out to a company.
Is that a direction?
It's a funny one.
It's so obviously needed and we're wasting so much time.
We truly are as a species.
I said this on the Omni podcast.
Sorry for saying two things on the same the same thing twice,
but we sometimes think I'm a big fan of Star Trek next generation.
Johnny Picard's my hero and I said Lucy sometimes is this how we get to the future?
Like is this thing that we see this whatever Madness what am I old madness at my own work?
Is this how we end up with the Starship Enterprise?
All right.
I don't think it is is it doesn't seem like we're on the right path
and I think I just like to know just in in the direction at all
and I think something like Johnny Decimal would help the problem at work is it's really hard
and it's really boring and you're not going to get any thanks for it.
And I just don't think people see it as an actual problem.
I don't think people other than a very few people who I've met who recognize that it's a thing that needs to be fixed.
I just think people see this whole filing and systems
and computer files and your email and knowledge as just this kind of background home of work
and the fact that it's not very good.
I don't think people even recognize let alone have the incentive to do anything about which is I think is a great shame.
It's like it's like the background radiation of a corporation.
It's just that's right forever present and we just acknowledge it and put our blinders on and it's all about forward.
It's just the cruft that we have to deal with that is that finding files
and things that you finding the important stuff that you're paid.
We're all essentially knowledge workers these days, right?
And so finding the thing you're paid to produce.
It's almost like the minute you produce it.
It's just like it's gone.
It's gone in the wind because nobody knows where it is anymore.
And it's it's kind of absurd when you think about it.
So I'd really really would like to solve that at some point.
I think I've realized there's there are people to help at home first and maybe they'll take it to work.
Maybe that's the path.
Yeah, you know, maybe maybe that's an easier way.
I mean funnily enough I was at my previous job for a large government large federal government department in here in Canberra
and my old boss the program director.
I heard him sing to his program controller.
Oh my God, the files are a mess.
Can we fix the files and I'm there like, whoa, like hang on a minute
and I jumped up like a little like I'm like, hey, I think you know, you're not going to believe this, right?
You're not going to believe who works for you
and I showed them the website and they never they never asked me again.
They just never bothered too hard and I overheard some future got it's too hard.
It's just too hard. Yeah, I can be bothered.
Yeah, it's it's got to be that employee that has the just it has it in them to do it on their own as a side thing
that has nothing to do with their job, but they just want to make it
but there's always at least one of those people that want to just make the system better,
even though it has nothing to do with anything and you got to like get that person to take this
and just run with it and just force it down people's throats,
but it's yeah, it's super hard and I think as well.
It's to the question earlier about whether I'm just generally organized at home as well.
I think it's that sort of person. I call them the librarian you need
and you're blessed if you've got one at work that was me,
you know, if you've got someone who is a bit like the librarian who just enjoys this who like
who doesn't see it as a chore who sees a neat file system and just like yeah,
this is great. That's what you need.
You need that person and you need to allow them to do it and give them give them the time give them the 10
or 15 percent a week that it takes to do this.
Well here at Hemispheric views. We don't have a librarian,
but we do have a foot who who just asserts his own will and way on us at all times.
So Martin perhaps you might get interested.
I've noticed our Hemispheric views shared folder is a little needs a little cleanup.
Oh, it's shame. So maybe maybe for someone so labeled to be so dictatorial.
I don't seem to be the one enforcing the systems that we use.
So that's pretty interesting Andrew just saying I'm just saying you might get a little just saying just saying.
So Johnny is there anything else that we have not touched upon that you think we should well our audience should know about.
I don't think so. I just wanted to while I'm here.
I did just want to gloat Andrew about how good Australia Post is in Canberra.
Have you got your phone yet? Oh my goodness. No, I've got some updates.
You haven't got it yet shared some updates on discord.
But yeah, maybe I should just quickly fill you in.
Okay, so before you do can I just gloat about Australia Post.
Yeah. Yeah. It's like our sorting office doesn't exist things come in from Sydney
and you can see on the little app that they've gone through the Fishwick sorting center
and minutes later they're on board for delivery and then an hour and a half later my postie Chi
who's a total dude is knocking on my door giving me my parcel Australia Post in Canberra is unbelievably good.
Take that WA just wanted to rub that in WA. Keeping their political masters happy no doubt.
Unbelievable. They don't get that sort of silver service in Western Australia.
My iPhone it remains according to my tracking. No still at Perth Airport,
but no apparently some other back tracking system that isn't public said it did go to the Bibra Lake distribution center
and it's just I had a phone call finally from the Bibra the manager of the Bibra Lake distribution center.
Wow Star Trek Australia Post whatever they were and they said the guy said to me he said yeah,
I'm just ringing up because you had a query lodged against this phone.
Did you ever receive it and that's the postman asking me the customer if I received the thing that they had custody of which brings into doubt the whole point of them as a logistics provider.
Wow and he said I said no unfortunately I have not received it.
So he said oh, okay. I guess that means I'll probably need to start looking for it.
So and as if that was like a week ago, I've not heard back from him at all.
What we've got also is we have my iPhone mini.
I returned that for recycling because that was part of the trade in deal.
So that that got sent off for trade in I have tracking number on that on Friday.
I had it tracked as received at received and signed at the place where they accept the recycling later that evening.
I got an email from Apple saying I'm sorry. You didn't get your phone back to us within the return window.
We will if it does arrive will reassess it but we won't necessarily hold you to the original value.
I'm like it was it's there. I see that exact same thing answer.
Now are they going to honor the original price that they said that they would pay me?
I don't know. So I might be asking them to send it back to me.
It's and now I'm still waiting on Apple.
They so Apple's decided that they would send me a replacement phone.
They said look yes, it's lost in transit.
I'll send you another one but the menu that's back at the queue.
So it's still being processed. So and you for shipment at the end of October.
So they've got Apple has my $2,000.
I don't have a phone and my my trade is being held in ransom.
So I'm using an iPhone SE 2 second generation SE and I got to say the touch touch ID is kind of nice.
That's what Lucy's got. She's still going. Yeah, she's still going on.
I'm wondering why I bothered spending money on a new phone except the camera sucks.
So the answer to how long is a piece of string is in fact really long.
Really long. Okay long still don't have it.
I told you you got a spotlight and those you know yarn spindles or things just go forever.
You will never get that phone. My goodness.
This is it's shocking is a disaster man.
Well, I'm sorry man. How's your friend sure never sold a mini?
Ah, are you a mini fan as well? Yes, sir.
13 mini everywhere. I always do something impromptu.
So I do just want to say that we're going to do some kind of contest
and I'm going to give away a Johnny decibel book.
I don't know how that's going to happen what is going to happen,
but we'll get it out somehow do a contest. I'll give you I'll give you a coupon code.
Oh, you don't even have to do that. But thank you so much.
We're giving away a book for sure because we got to give we got to get this out to the world
and I'm I am going to do a 30-day commitment to actually trying to reset up all my stupid files
in this manner and I'll report back. I'm going to do it too.
I'm going to read because I'll use Johnny decimal in Devon think for a long time.
I'm definitely not going to do that something happened,
but I think what I need to do is I think I'm maybe I need to just go find her.
What do you reckon guys? Find her.
Find it really Andrew. He's going to be tough.
What is going on under 30 days? All right, I'm going to do it.
I promise her to be a finder detox.
Well, my iCloud sync. That's the other challenge.
Oh God. Oh no poor iMac. Any other serious questions for Johnny before we before we wrap?
Well, no, I'm going to leave the closing.
I get to Martin because I feel like he needs he needs to have a good say.
I've said a lot this episode. So I think I'm going to hand over to Martin.
Look, I want to say thank you John. I've learned a lot
and although I won't necessarily commit right now without having had extra consideration about the system.
It does sound fantastic. It sounds like it solves a lot of problems
and I think people who've been listening today may be quite easily convinced
because I'm starting to lose track of things in my own life too.
So thank you for taking the time to actually be on the show.
It's great that people not only listen and they actually want to be on it.
Thanks very much for having me. I really appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
And live update Andrew, you know what? I didn't like how the files looked so they're gone deleted.
