(upbeat music)
- Let's get ready to rumble.
- 'Cause it's episode 40.
- 40.
- That's a lot.
- Who would have thought?
How long have we been doing this now?
Just over a year?
- It feels like a lot.
- I didn't think we'd get to 40.
If we had a 50, it'd be really like, wow.
I was surprised we got to four.
(laughing)
- Why is that?
- I don't know, it's just like,
you never know with this kind of thing.
It could work or it could be like, this is terrible.
I never wanna speak to you again.
- Or was it the two or three episodes
and you realized that you actually hated this?
- Oh, that was even before we started,
but I figured I could make it through at least like a pilot
or maybe episode two.
- I remember how angry Jason was getting
when he tried to edit.
And I thought, oh, this isn't gonna last.
- I really--
I think did not go well with Jason.
No.
The rage was traveling around the world.
I could record 600 podcasts a week, but I can't even record one a week because I
immediately just want to stop.
I think that's probably why I don't do my own because I feel like it'd be weird if I did my own podcast and then said like, Hey, can one of you guys edit this for me?
I don't really think that would go over very well.
Oh, by the way, do it for free also, because this is free.
What was it that you didn't like about editing particularly?
So I've been known to really hate things that are fiddly.
So if something's fiddly,
I'm pretty ready to just chuck it out the window and not do it or pay someone
else to do it for me. Okay. And for whatever reason,
it's just so different than even video editing.
I'm not a huge video editing fan either,
but maybe it's because there's less, well,
I shouldn't say less involved, but I feel like with audio, it's,
There's five trillion little cuts that you have to make.
And then you have all these little stupid things you have to line up.
And then you have to listen back to yourself about 6 trillion times.
And I just am not a fan of doing that.
So hence why I early on said, this isn't working.
It's not me.
It's you.
You compensate with the show notes though.
So that's good.
Show notes are good.
I enjoy doing the notes way more.
A, I only have to listen back to the episode
like one-ish times.
Sometimes I have to go back if either of you
have said something that I'm completely lost on.
And then I fall down like crazy search holes
of like, maybe they meant this?
It's like, no, that doesn't have .com.au at the end.
So that's probably not what they were talking about.
- And then the inevitable question on Discord for,
what are you talking about?
Yeah, yeah, usually I will finish and then pop a message in and say notes are done
except
What the hell were you talking about here? And then you immediately fill it in I go
Oh, I just completely misheard what you said. Got it
I don't know about Andrew, but sometimes I feel like I'm a deliberate butthole and I just say something deliberately obscure. It's kind of fun
It's like a game for me where it's like a like a treasure hunt almost cuz he'll say something and nothing comes to mind
Right now but inevitably there'll be something
That you will have said during the show that I did not hear because I'm only like half
Cognizant while I'm recording Jason. Do you know you don't have to edit? What's that? You don't have to edit a live show
No by its very nature a show a show that is live does not require editing which is good and bad
Yeah, is there something we could talk about with live shows?
Is there something going on that we need to inform the listeners there is it is the
Hemispheric views live watch of
Crocodile Dundee part one because there are three if you did not know
Some of you all of you probably knew at least the first one existed if you didn't boy are you in for a treat?
They really should have stopped at part one to be perfectly fair. There was a second one
Yeah, I mean it happened. We kind of allowed it
Then there was a third one
Which is kind of if it was sort of like a home alone kind of thing where there was the first one
It was like ah brilliant great. Love it second one. Okay, we've done this before but sure
We're you know movies are a little dry right now. We're we're Jones in for something
We'll take the second one, even though we not not gonna be as good and then they're like
Let's just change everything about it and have a third one use the same name like sure obviously money grab
Was not a good idea. I don't actually think I've seen the third one. I thought you got you ordered the criterion collection
I have them all. Oh, I've got all of them beautiful
high-definition
remastered
recently released 30th anniversary
edition blu-rays
Yeah, and I think they come with directors commentaries that you can compare ours with
That is a good question. I haven't actually checked
I can't watch too much of it because I don't want to spoil my my live
Reactions because I haven't seen it in a long time, but I've said all of that to say that
The live watch is happening. Let's see. It'll be
October 23rd
slash 24th
Here we go with time zones
Already stuffed us up once I know actually, you know what hold that thought
Let me actually open up the flyer. If you haven't seen the flyer check the notes. It's top quality
We had top ad agencies out of New York City
Create this flyer for us. No expense spared
Let's see the flyer states that it is at
Okay, October 23rd
From 8 p.m. To 9 30 that is US West Coast
Now at that same exact time believe it or not. It's actually the 24th of October
11 a.m. To 12 30 p.m. In
Perth
WA
represent then
2 p.m. To 3 30 p.m. In the gong. Okay, so
Yes, it sounds like it's a two-day event. It's not time zone suck
End of story so come on by and watch Crocodile Dundee with us while we basically talk over the entire movie and ruin it
Which if that's not your thing, sorry, but it is Crocodile Dundee. So like
probably give us a pass on that or
Everything will fail miserably and it'll just kind of be everyone chatting about something else
Beautiful now I have an announced trivia corner
Time to this today. Did you hear that? I did. Yes. I'm in that trivia corner. All right. I'm ready to lose off
We go. All right one question today due to our shorter format
In what year was the delicious Tim Tam chocolate biscuit introduced? Oh a
1935 B
1956 C
1964 or D
1970 you go first man. I've locked in my answer. I'm gonna jump in and say be in the 50s
I'm not super confident about that
But the reason that I say that is because I have some feeling that
Earlier on all the bickies that aren't it's that's for people who listening who aren't Australian, you know
I'm it's just the manufacturer. I think a lot of that stuff would have been scotch fingers milk arrowroot biscuits
Not necessarily chocolate coated things. I'm gonna say that was a little bit later in the manufacturing process
Okay, so you so you said 1956 that was your correct. Okay. Yeah for similar reason. I'm gonna actually look in 1970
I'm gonna think we're in war post-war
deprivation
mindset for a long time
like Martin said technology hadn't moved on and the cost of
managing and shipping and making and
Producing chocolate coated biscuits
Separate ensuring they didn't melt in the package. None of that technology was ready before 1970
Hmm. Well, I mean if anyone would know it's mr. Lean manufacturing also, mr
Just ate eight Tim Tams yesterday from a pack of 11 fair. Oh, which one did you have? I know you're a double coat fan
Andrew I'm a double coat. I didn't see double coat on the shelf
Oh, well, you need to include this photo on the show notes just for Jason. I was at
Woolies yesterday have to walk by the Tim Tam section, which is a huge Bay of
The supermarket poor Americans who hear the novelty of Tim Tams can't really struggle to get access to them
We just wander into the local bullies and there are millions of different varieties of Tim Tams
Double coat as you say are my favorites didn't see them beyond that. I'm a traditionalist. I'm always a plain guy
So I just went the original. Mm-hmm. Yep got the coffee from the the the nearby takeaway shop and
Drank my coffee and a few Tim Tams straight out of the packet. Yeah, it's one of those days
Sounds like the dream. I was gonna say I don't know if this has changed overseas, but we did manage to get Jason some
Tim-tam sent from within the US and I think he enjoyed them
But I remember when I was on exchange in Germany a few years ago
Well more than a few years ago now the guy I stayed with tried to find if they could be imported into Germany
He said hmm. It appears that there are preservatives used in Tim-tams that the German government does not deem safe
Human consumption I went well clearly the Germans have higher standards than the rest of maybe the English-speaking world
So you feel all right Jason you haven't had any bouts of gastro as a result of a Tim Tam
That's where the flavor comes from is those preservatives. Oh, yeah, that's right. That's really good. Yeah, I've had them now
For real an actual one not some knockoff
Crap and they're bleeping delicious. Do you I like them a lot then I started looking into other snacks that I could acquire
And there are several other flavors that I'm quite interested in.
Dark chocolate version, absolutely want that because dark chocolate is always better than
milk chocolate.
And then there was like a mango or something.
I don't, I'm confused by it, but I very much want to try it because it just sounds deliciously
weird.
And then I went down the rabbit hole of just all the other snacks/chip type things that
I could acquire.
And so I have another quite overly large box of items coming my way.
Because I kind of, basically, if there would have been a button that just said, like, "One
of each," I would have just clicked that to save myself some time.
But there wasn't, so I had to manually go through and do that.
But I'll report back on further items.
I do have some outstanding comparisons/which one is better than the others that I owe to
Natasha still yeah, I cannot submit those until I actually try all of the varieties because I feel it's not fair
This would be good to hear about during the live watch because for context for listeners
We all gonna listen snacks just so that Jason would have something leading up to the live watch
If he in fact didn't consume everything before the viewing of that
That's part of the issue is that everything will be long gone before
That comes about so I'm gonna need a refill for sure if you buy gumption don't eat that
That's a cleaning product now. I put this in the notes. It'll be quick for me, but I think Andrew has something
Oh, I hate internet update. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Wait, hold on. I'll try again soon rewind
rewind
so on all of these foods that you had sent to me you have a
health food star rating on
All of your snacks that we did not have here
I will not comment on the fact that every snack you sent me had no more than basically 1.5 stars out of 5
I'm assuming that means that they're not
Quote good for you, or that just means the lower star ones taste better would be my assumption
We should have sent you a carrot. Sorry about that. Yeah food star thing. Is this
Has this always been around since you guys were kids or is this a relatively new thing in Australia?
I was just curious. I don't need like a full history just
Has this been something, and do you care about it?
Is it, or is it just a government thing?
- It hasn't been around since we were kids.
There have long been nutritional labels
like you would have in the US,
but maybe with some different measurements and so on.
Really, for years and years,
there's been this thing in Australia,
which hasn't been on everything, I think, necessarily.
Andrew, you could correct me,
but there's been like the Heart Foundation tick,
things that get different ratings,
or maybe you'd go to fast food restaurants
or other eateries and they would apply different ticks
ratings to stuff but to my knowledge the health star rating is a more recent invention which was
an attempt to say look nutritional labels are on packaging but not everyone necessarily understands
what's going on there or compares things or does things according to the correct serving or number
of grams so let's just take all of that data and put it into a very easy thing that you slap on
the front of the packaging that says this is better or worse than something else so it's really just
just to make the information that's always been there easier to digest.
I do recall in my ancient business lobbyist history,
one of my one of my interesting deviations in a career path,
far too much talk from the food industry about thumbnails
and the requirement for thumbnails on packaging
and what particular information would go on said thumbnails.
And those thumbnails were actually shaped like thumbnails
in that they were square on the bottom and almost like little tombstones.
and they would have a little curvature at the top.
Oh, are you talking about those little things that form a row with those little like percentage
something rather?
Correct.
Right.
Is that what they're called, thumbnails?
A lot of the effort and back and forth went on between industry and government and various
lobby groups regarding the content and detail and specificity of said thumbnails.
I don't like that they're called thumbnails.
I'm glad that you explained that.
Yeah, Jason, I had, until it clicked in my head what Andrew was talking about on Australian
packaging I had the same horrible vision of like someone with their bathroom
vanity clipping fungal nails or something but no it's just a little
shape. Thumbnails and food should not be in the same note. You don't want to call them tombstones. I mean
considering what we're eating you might as well but... Look I'm still sure that
everything else is better than the musk stick which Natasha got some this morning
That would not have any stars or anything on it, it would just be...
a negative star it's a dead star I don't know whatever it's bad mm-hmm okay now
now you can talk about internet update internet update corner yes I'm sorry
just um no no no no no no Feldfoot's coming down I have a very quick internet
update I just wanted to share that after years of agony in this apartment of ours
on this shared lot I have finally organized new internet.
*Gasp*
Yes.
Is it gigabit fiber?
Oh, no.
Is it satellite?
Is it wireless satellite?
No.
So the short version is for years I've struggled because the place is obviously pre-NBN, like
National Broadband Network broadband.
I've got these concrete walls, the port in this office doesn't have any signal to it
So over time I've done this band-aid series of fixes where I've got the thing that goes through the electrical wiring
That's what has made all these podcast recordings possible. Thank goodness
But finally who would have thought that I would find out about a better deal that was actually, you know, not only
Justified in the cost but with better signal and performance. I found out about it through the mail
I got a letter from regional Southern
Yes, I've got a letter from the Southern phone company saying we've got this new fast NBN deal by Australian standards
Don't get your hopes up Jason. What is NBN?
National Broadband Network. Oh, okay. So basically
Many many governments have gone. Don't do it
No, no, nobody wants to know about internet politics
They promised something successive governments continue to ruin it and here we are and it kind of works. That's the short version
All right, everyone complains. So now I actually have something that achieves 100 megabits per second with a new modem and
Even though it doesn't reach this room with that door closed behind me that none of the listeners can see
The wiring thing takes care of the rest and now hopefully we won't have issues anymore. You've got a hundred megabits
Yes, and it has actually achieved that on the speed test. Oh
You're faster than me now. I mean it fluctuates
I've had like 89 and then down to 56 or whatever but it's actually happened.
Yeah, it's always good. I mean it's always gonna be a theoretical max. I mean I don't think I've ever gone above 980.
Shut up.
This being said, the funny thing is that the moment I finally changed and everything's been fixed, we've had infrastructural issues with the NBN line.
Oh no.
And Natasha got a message from Optus, who's her mobile provider, saying, "Oh, by the way,
there will be NBN outages on the morning, early in the morning of this Tuesday, which
is when what is happening?"
The Apple event.
Oh!
So, yes.
So, basically, the internet is so much better, but it could fall over at any moment because
NBN.
So you have it now?
Thank you very much.
Yes, it's running right now.
Oh, okay.
Nice.
Wow.
it was never actually clear what the problem was. You spoke to the network, they said it
was this. I got someone out to check this, he said it was that. And so I was just...
Typical. ...ran around in circles until I burnt everything
down and replaced everything. So congratulations on your new internet.
That is exciting. Thank you.
Southern internet, wool and gongs. Well done.
Something or other. Whatever you did with your old school mail
outs. I think they call it gong net.
I should. I like it. I can just imagine...
I think they're trying to market is a grandma's and Martin
sending it straight in the mail.
Do you guys have like independent internet places that have like
stupid slash quirky names or is that not a thing there?
Are we there's been Dodo for years, which is kind of the worst
name because it yeah, sorry, but Southern phone the ones I signed
up to that.
That's exactly the kind of company that people joke about the
like geriatrics sign up for it.
Yeah.
Well, they mail, they mail you promotions.
Well, I opened it up and I went, Natasha, this could be the answer all of our questions.
And it came in an envelope.
You're going to have zero congestion after 7pm.
Yeah, for sure.
Yeah, it's been great.
Everybody's gone to sleep.
All the customers are not using the network.
Yeah. And they don't stream because they don't know how to.
So you're good to go.
They're going to be looking at the data coming from Martin's house, being like, jeez, we're losing money on this guy.
What is going on?
Oh, he's uploading.
What does this mean?
You want apps?
We got apps.
It's hemispheric apps.
What a great theme that was.
Happy to hear that.
Oh, I love that theme.
It's my one of one of my favorites for sure.
I see.
Now I wanted to bring this up because I think both of you will have something to say about this.
And I'm sure that our listeners, whether their response was on Discord, via email, Twitter, micro dot blog, whatever, will also have something to say about this.
It can be pretty controversial.
I was thinking about how we all have a dock on our Mac or, you know, a home screen on iPad or iPhone or whatever.
And we put icons there that we like, apps that we use often.
But I'm sure that there are apps out there that we do use pretty frequently that we don't put in such a prominent position on the dock or on the front home screen, because something about the icon annoys us.
Maybe where the app comes from, maybe aesthetically it's very displeasing.
I want to know if you too, like I do, have such apps that you can't bear to put in such
a prominent position.
So I'm going to maybe start off while you're having a think if you haven't thought about
this already.
I'm going to start off with the iOS home screen.
This was challenging, but then I managed to pin it down to maybe two examples.
The first one is the Service NSW app.
Now Andrew would have an equivalent of this in WA I'm sure.
This is essentially like the government service app where you can do different things like
COVID check-ins and things about your accounts and health and so on.
It's actually not a bad icon, but I think the thing that annoys me is that even though
I have to use it all the time for checking in and checking out, there's just something
about having a semi-shonky, dodgy government app on my front home screen which just feels
a little bit dystopian.
I don't know what it is.
We've already had to walk around with masks everywhere, I accept that, and you're checking
and checking out, telling everyone where you are all the time.
But to put it on my front home screen, it's just a bit.
Yeah, I'm not into that.
You just said something that made me think that it was funny, even though it's not
funny, where you're saying that you're checking in everywhere you're going and like,
oh, it's so dystopian.
It's like people have been doing that for literally years with corporations
that don't give a shit about them.
And now all of a sudden it's a big deal.
It's like, oh, my God, they know where I'm at, where I'm at.
It's like, you've been on like, what was it, Foursquare and Facebook and all this other
shit for 20 years, and you've told them every deepest, darkest secret you have, and now
it's like, we want to make sure everybody is not contacting a deadly virus.
Don't you dare interrupt my liberties!
They need to add a liking feature, don't they?
"Oh, Andrew checked into The Chemist.
Like!"
Yeah, if you gave them a badge for being the mayor of that stupid location, people would
be all about it.
But that's a really good point. No, no, no, but that's a good point because location services even for maps and stuff and different apps
I accept I've been doing this kind of stuff for ages haven't done four square kinds of stuff for a good while
Let me tell you but it made me think about how there is no real other than just you know
Contributing to the greater good of society
There doesn't appear to be an advantage in doing this in the way that you get like a dopamine hit from a like or something
So I'm constantly using this thing which just feels like a bit of an annoyance that I have to accept
But I don't want to put on my front home screen
So I'll always do like the camera shortcut swipe to check in with the QR code and get around it that way
The other example that I had was my banking app like I go in there. I see what's going on
I don't know if Andrew is gonna be offended by this the fact that my banking app is not on the front home screen
But like it just I don't have to think about my money. I don't want to have to think about the money
It's like I have checked it. My pay's gone in there
I'm going to transfer to this account, but it's like this is not fun, right?
And it's one of those apps that has a white background and I think great
So now I'm just gonna have more white space on some app icon not a fan
I'll quickly move on and I don't have too much to say about this one because we've talked about it before
I'm jumping to say you just need you need to disaggregate you less banking app more one app app. That's all
surprise
The example that I have from Mac OS, I'm not going to talk about this too much because we've discussed it before
Microsoft Teams, I have to use it every day, but not only because is it by the Microsoft Corporation?
I just don't like that app icon. I don't think it fits the aesthetic of anything on the computer
So even though it's there the whole day and then when I leave the computer it turns off
I have it appear in the far right position not kept in the dock
So when I hit command Q it disappears and I no longer have to be offended by that icon
So who's next? I'll go yep
You're for me you're four minutes. Oh
Gosh, okay. I have three
Hmm. They're actually all kind of related which is weird. Yeah, so as we've discussed probably many times I have a
connected home
Quote unquote right so I got a bunch of crap that does stuff in my house connected the internet
Yeah, they all have really really bad icons
Surprise surprise. So the three that came to mind immediately and the the caveat here is is
When you're talking about this, these are things that you actually use and interact with but just can't stand looking at and the three that
I came up with were the August lock
which is a like
Front door or I mean, I guess any door but a automatic door thingy
It's not necessarily a bad icon, but I just can't I just don't like it. I guess is what I would say
the next one is the
Sprinkler controller, which I believe is a company called
Rachio, Rachio. I don't know. I'm probably saying that incorrectly, but their icon is like a weird little
Stick tree bush thing. I don't know. I don't like it. Anyway enough said
Right. The final one is from a company called Air Things. So I've got these
sensor thingies that I have on each floor of the house that monitor various
air quality stuff and then tell you like, "Whoa, you got like a CO2 issue in this
room," or "You've got this, that, or the other thing going on in there." And it's
It's not that it's a bad icon necessarily.
It's the fact that it looks like a, I'm trying to think of what the other app is called,
there's a notes app that looks like a mountain, but the mountain is like a pencil thing.
I don't know if either of you can think of what that is, but this icon looks like it's
supposed to be a notes app because it looks like a pencil tip, but it has nothing to do
with notes.
So it's just very confusing and weird.
Like why would you pick that?
I guess it's supposed to be an A for air things.
I don't know, it's weird.
So that one I keep, I do a swipe down and search for that.
And then going with your theme of bank stuff,
basically every bank app is the worst possible experience
you could ever have, inside and out,
which is weird 'cause a lot of times you'll have apps
where the icon is really good,
which usually tells you that the app is really good
because if they took the time with the icon,
the app is probably okay.
Then you have the category where the app is like,
oh, it looks pretty good.
Then you go into it and you're like, what happened here?
How did I end up back in like iOS 3?
Not sure, but cool.
Very rarely do you have the opposite
where you have an atrocious icon
with an absolutely brilliant UI of an app.
I cannot think of an example.
If anyone has one, I would love to know,
but I don't think that anyone is spending zero time
on an icon and then has a brilliant looking app.
I think that's one thing with apps is it's very much,
the book is judged by its cover
because that's your entry point into paying whatever it is.
Take out of the mix the whole everything's free now.
But generally, if you look at an app and it's like,
this app is $4.99, $5.99, $100.99, whatever.
If that app icon is complete garbage,
I don't think anybody's gonna buy that
unless they absolutely have to have it
for a work thing or something.
So those would be my picks
that came to mind immediately right now.
- Now, I sent both of you a message
while you were talking, Jason.
- Yes. - Did I find the correct app
you're talking about?
- Yes. - Upnote?
- That's the one.
It looks like a mountain, but it's a pencil.
Yes. - There you go.
Found a, look at that efficiency.
- Can I ask a question? - And accuracy.
What does your air quality meter do if you fart in the room?
Fair question.
I would imagine that the particulate matter, uh, index would increase.
Have you not tried it?
I haven't, but I, I would have been right up against that thing.
Letting rip.
Right on the sensor.
Yeah.
Wow.
Okay.
I'll, I'll, I'll note to move them higher.
Yeah.
Fair enough.
So Andrew.
Yeah.
I've probably like the WA
Check-in app thing. I have that on my dock
Very depressing to do that, but you just I use it so often
But it's burning a space in my dock which you know could otherwise go to something more interesting
You've accepted the authority of the government. I have
Any other examples Andrew yes
Any list I'm a loyal subscriber to the any list application. It's a gross
Everybody talks about paprika paprika gets all the love
Really any list is well, I think it's better. I've never used paprika, but I like any list I pay for it every year
Paprika is better for recipe management
No, any list shopping really good recipes though
we have lots of recipes in any list, but
Have you tried obsidian?
So so any any list is really good, but I don't like it's a icon so I got to keep that that bad boy hidden
Have you tried keeping your recipes in wine app?
No, but I or in Devon Jimbo or something then you could you could budget each meal
No, I don't do that, but when I go to Woolies I got a
Note that I spend money. Well, you lost my train of thought now. Thanks a lot. I
Have tried different different thing for recipes. It doesn't work doesn't scale well the UI affordances are not great
So any list sorry I have to search you each time the other obvious culprit is Microsoft stuff
Just everywhere I keep that that is never on my dock
Especially on the Mac where I use it for work every day all the Microsoft stuff
I kind of have to but every day it pops up on the right hand side of the dock and at the end of every
It all goes away. Yes, and especially teams those people. Why do the teams people have those little curved butts?
Really? There's like a why does the guy in the front have like a shield? What is that?
What is that person in the front of a shield for what are they battling? This is not a bad corporate HR
I'm more put off by the fact that they insist on putting the first letter in each app icon just to remind you that it
Starts with T, but Excel apparently starts with the letter X. Yes
And not the letter E
So
Anyway, is that so they don't step on the toes of the old Microsoft entourage? What's the deal Oh
entourage
Teams took the purple as well didn't it?
Entourage was purple. That's right. That shield should have an e on the front
The other app I don't like this is more just an app. I don't like an icon. I don't like Firefox
Yeah, that's that's ugly don't like having that in my doc
Although ironically I have it in my doc at the moment on my Mac because you run 15 browsers
welcome to
corporate business world sometimes with containers and multiple logins
and
Special mention to an app that I don't use anymore on the Mac
I did for a long time and it's one of these ones that has to be permanently resident and you
There was no good way that I could discover of hiding the doc app and it's the worst dog app doc app in the world
I know Jason's gonna know what I'm talking about when I say
Spam sieve. Oh
the mushroom the mushroom strainer
It's a colander
Yeah
And it's hilarious because it's got this ugly cartoonish icon and there's an option in the app to change it to
Modern iGlenn, which is hideous. It's even worse.
Have you brought this up before? I remember you.
I started using it for a while and then was like, what am I doing? This is terrible.
I'm not doing this anymore. This is a waste of my life.
Yeah. There was so much management associated with managing my spam filtering.
Meanwhile, I'm paying for FastMail and stuff that is just willing to do it for me.
Yeah, well it always became the opposite problem where I spent 99% of the time training it
so that I could not get one spam message every like 15 years.
I was like, why do I hate myself?
I don't know, this is, no.
And you have to leave your Mac running all the time.
Yeah, FastMail does this for you and you don't have to do anything and it's perfectly fine.
They filter everything.
Great topic.
There's a service called OMG.lol you can now email me with
@OMG.lol
Email me!
Why would I do that? Why would I want to... well I guess A) why would I want to
email you at all and B) why wouldn't I just use one of your other 15 email
addresses that you have. Well sure that's an option too but or if you don't want
to email me just go to canyon.omg.lol
Okay I'm going there now. Hey it's you! Look it's another me page because the
internet was running short of me pages. It really was. Yeah so I spent five bucks
to get this page and not only do you get the page you get the email address.
That's like a little bonus they throw in.
- If I do /now, will it tell me the things
that you were doing six months ago
'cause you haven't updated it?
- Oh no, that's on canyon.me/now, I think.
- Oh, okay.
- It might be andrewcanyon.com/now, I lose track.
(laughing)
- Wow, you have a lot.
- And I think I've got about three different versions
of my now page.
But anyway, you can never have too much internet presence
if you're trying to build a brand.
And my brand is Canyon, C-A-N-I-O-N,
except on Twitter where I Twitter rage quit
and lost CA and ION and had to come back late
and join as Andrew Canyon.
So there's a whole thing about that.
- I did not know that, I didn't know you did that.
- Yeah, I was originally Canyon and Kaboom.
- Who took it?
- Oh, I think some spam bot.
- That's how they get you.
- My brother was really angry with me
'cause he originally wanted Canyon
but had to choose Patrick Canyon.
So now look, we're both loser Canyons with our first name.
- And then instead of giving him Canyon,
you just threw it away.
- Just threw it away.
(laughs)
- Wow.
- He was so angry.
I would never follow you. That's too many characters
Yeah, I know
OMG lol, it's fun the I found about out about this through Mike on micro blog, but that's not
Mikey nor M y ke but is ma I
If you go to ma
IQe dot omg dot lol you'll find Mike
He's from Lisbon. I think Portugal I think he's a nice good dude. He was giving away a
a subscription to the OMG service, just because you want to be nice. I went and checked it
out. I liked it so much I just bought it myself.
There you go.
There you go.
I do not. I don't have one of these.
So I'm going to put that, file that alongside my bio.link and my tree. Is that the tree
link? What's that tree one? Tree link?
I have no idea what you're, I thought you were having a stroke just now.
Link tree.
I'm not sure what's going on.
Link tree.
Okay.
You know, link tree.
How do you keep all this do you just have like 50 bookmarks you have to go update every time you like change a thing
I've got a whole he does knowledge management to keep track all of this. Oh, it's obsidian. No, it's a database
No, it's actually it actually OMG. Lol. It's called Evan Jimbo. Totally. No joke
I have I have just created the other day a
Safari tab group called
Profile, it's just got all my different like websites because I can't keep track of them all
So my question is given all of the different online identities that you have
why didn't you just settle with a really consistent name that you've already used
on Apple's Game Center Grand Canyon? It's a fair point. Yeah I always struggle with
this whether I want to be Mimi like real me or whether I want to be hidden behind a username me.
So what's the you and what's the you you I don't understand. It's too hard trying to pretend to be
some like cool with a person with a leet username.
So I gave up on that and I just went, I'm just me.
So people can just find me and they'll find all versions of me.
They'll find nerd me, they'll find business me.
I can't be bothered trying to hide behind leet personas.
Well, you do you or you, you or whatever it is that you want to do.
Or cool you.
Or just, or just Canyon, C-A-N-I-O-N.
How is that spelled again?
Put it into DuckDuckGo.
You'll find all sorts.
That is Andrew Canyon, C-A-N-Y-O-N.
- Don't!
(laughing)
- Don't worry, I get F-I-E-L-D all the time.
- Yeah, and Bert gets B-U-K-R.
B-U-R-K-E.
- If I ever get a B-U-K-R, someone's getting punched.
- Just off booker.
- You're drunk, sir, go home.
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
- I need clarity here, okay.
Yes, Claire, clarification is what I'm here for.
In Australia, we see many, many American TV shows, movies, what have you.
Many of those are set in primary schools and high schools.
I'm specifically thinking mainly high schools at this point, but primary qualify.
With how much people complain and bitch about high school, we sure have a lot of
like a disproportional, like amount of like high school focus on stuff.
Oh man.
Everybody seems to hate it, but it's like everything's high school.
Seriously.
I want to go. I for many years of my primary life, I was looking forward to going to somehow going to an American high school because they look the business.
Really? Anyway.
Did you obsess about red cups when you were a kid?
Yes.
Red cups like solo cups?
Yes. They're only just available in Australia in the last few years.
It was so exciting.
The solo cup, like just the red plastic cup.
Yeah, the party cup.
The white rim or whatever.
Or the yeah, people obsess about that over here in Australia.
I don't know. I don't know why.
You're not having a good party until you've got a keg and a bunch of those cups, right? Am I right, Martin?
Uh, not for me, but yes.
I don't think he's convinced.
Anyway, I want to finish my point here before I get derailed. Yeah. Is it so in all those
schools, it's portrayed that Americans sit down in class at those little desks, little with the little sort of chair and the
like the lecture style desks with the little arms,
and they always pull out a yellow pencil.
- Number two pencil.
- Thank you, number two pencil.
We don't have those pencils here.
We have pencils, but our pencils are usually red and black,
Faber-Castell or something like that.
- Staedtler.
- Staedtler, yes, you're right.
Do Americans really use pencils like that?
Do they use it in high school?
And have they not ever heard of a bloody Biro?
because they're way better than pencils.
Can you just give me the lowdown
on the American pencil situation as it pertains to school?
- Yeah, well, I am part of the pencil lobby,
so I will give that disclaimer first right out of the gate.
Okay, so American high school.
Have not been to high school in many years.
Didn't actually finish, maybe I did, I don't know.
I was told to leave high school at one point,
so I can only speak to part of it.
- Troubled youth.
Number two pencils were a huge thing for a little sheet of paper that our American audience
will know and probably cringe when I say "scantron."
See?
Neither of you cared.
It's like a little weird rectangular piece of paper with a bunch of little bubbles on
it for each question.
It's very difficult to understand where you are on it and it's easy to fill in the wrong
bubble, which is great when you're taking standardized tests.
So a number two pencil was always required.
Not sure if that was actually true or if that was just a way to try to keep people in line
in any way possible, but that's where we're at.
Number two pencils were generally yellow.
Yes, that was always a thing.
I don't imagine anyone's using that today in our technological world where everyone
has you know one what is one laptop per kid or whatever I think a lot of one to one that
there you go one crank handle one is that the no no one laptop per child yeah it's yep
yep no not that one I do remember that one and I wanted one of those because I had the
little cool ears but um anyway no I don't think anybody really has pencils anymore but
But yeah, number two pencil was definitely a thing.
It was yellow, it was as boring as possible.
I do remember always seeking out the really nice pencils
when I needed a pencil so that I could, you know.
If I was gonna fail that test,
I was gonna fail it in style with a really good pencil.
They had that special sharpener
that could only be used with that pencil.
If you tried to use the regular sharpener,
it would just ruin the pencil.
You'd have that two-stage sharpener.
I was one of those kids.
But yeah, that was totally a thing.
Yellow pencils was very, at least in my youth,
I think that was very much a thing.
I can't imagine that's a thing anymore though.
- Did you have Byros?
- I don't know what a Byro is.
I'm not familiar with that.
Is that a brand of pencil?
- Man, man, we need--
- Well, I mean, it's just a pen, essentially.
- Oh, a pen?
Oh yeah, I mean--
- Byro's the guy who invented the things.
His name was Byro.
- But if you had to have a pencil,
I mean, you had to have a pencil.
Pencil was mandatory for some things.
testing, math classes, usually you had a pencil
'cause you were erasing, but--
- See, I'm gonna go pre-high school down to primary
or elementary school for a second for this discussion
because the two things that come up
when you talk about pens and pencils in Australia,
at least for my generation or age group,
I'm not sure what you have, Andrew,
but there was one, the pen license.
Normally around year four, you had to earn your pen license
right once you had shown that you could be trusted,
not to have to rub out all the time with an eraser.
I'm not gonna say rubber only
'cause I'm sure Americans will hear rubber and go,
who's handing out rubbers to primary school kids?
You would erase.
And once you had proven that you could be trusted
with whiteout or liquid paper or whatever,
you could move to the pen.
The first person to get their pen license
when I was in primary school was a left-handed person,
which was highly controversial,
but she had the neatest handwriting of anyone in the class,
which people really couldn't understand.
How do you not smudge?
Did she have to do the claw thing?
- Oh, she had excellent like running writing,
beautiful parallel kind of cursive.
The other thing, and I'm actually gonna send this
in a message to both of you
and include this in the show notes.
- I'm a little disappointed you were not the first one
with the pen license.
I mean, were you the first one with the red pen license?
Is that how that went?
- I was big on red pens.
- It's correct.
- You're totally right on that.
I loved red pens.
Still love a red pen.
But away from pens for a second.
- I'm just trying to keep your rep here.
I wanna make sure that people aren't gonna disrespect you
on not having the pen license first and...
- No, no, I wasn't bothered by that.
I was much more insane about getting my touch typing done
in my computer lessons at primary school.
Thank you, Mr. Costigan for that.
But just check out the message that I sent to both of you.
And this was the standard issue book
or booklet that we received for all of our writing
across different subjects in primary school.
This is what everyone my age received.
And it was this kind of Sydney Opera House
with Harbour Bridge in the background design.
And that a hardcover no it was soft.
It was like a paperback thing.
Did you have this and because I'm older than you we had one that had like it was stone table.
I actually it was like it was still 1960s design.
I had like a little kid on a bike and it was like it was like riding a bike and it had like road safety keep right or something and I was always like why keeping right on a bike not left.
Which is really weird to me, and it had multiplication table grids on the bottom half of that.
But yeah, the same sort of standardized exercise book.
Was it clearly Australian, or was it very much generic?
Was there any way to tell one way or the other?
There's really no way to tell, but I reckon it was Australian.
I think they- it was kind of exciting in one of those new exercise books.
I liked it.
Yeah, it was always this fresh feel.
But I was curious, I didn't think that you would have had the same thing as what we did,
but I kind of thought-
But we didn't have the opera house, that's for sure.
No, that's what I was wondering because the education systems here for Jason are state-based
I don't know what it's like in the US
But I was thinking wouldn't it be just so typically Australian that every Western Australian child would get like a Sydney Opera House
Same thing like this is this is Australia. This is what everyone thinks of Australia
No one knows what Perth is who cares if it doesn't have Paul Hogan on it. I'm not interested
Well, you know Paul Hogan actually used to paint the Harbour Bridge. That's what he did before he acted
Oh, I'm very aware of that. And I saw I saw the ad that made me sad
Yeah, when he like put on the Statue of Liberty costume, I was like what what is happening right now
Can I say one other thing? Can I just give one huge big shout out to patreon member one prime plus?
subscriber
Perth bandits for developing our very own
Uniform hemispheric views basketball uniform. This guy is an elite
Basketball uniform designer he has done so much stuff for that
Well so much unofficial stuff for the National Basketball League all of his unofficial stuff is actually better than the official stuff
And there's I would agree. There's quite a push to get him employed by the league to actually do their designs. I
4000% thought he somehow was involved with like a marketing agency or something that had to do with the NBL
because yeah all this shit he cranks out is like top
freaking quality and I don't understand
why
like these aren't just
Made for people to buy. Oh man
Is that some of the ones he's made like just to have them to wear to actual events would be
amazing
Yeah, so yes, I agree
Yeah, and speaking of NBL I watched a video today regarding
basketball
Right, what was it?
It was something about how the three-point shot is ruining basketball and making it boring and I watched it and thought
That was a bad video. This is stupid. This doesn't make any sense. I don't really understand. That video was shallow
My counterpoint would be there should be added a ten-point shot
where you have to be at least three-quarters of the court away from the goal and
Standing with your back to it and overhead huck it behind you and if you hit that ten points
That would make the game even more exciting
So do you know what would make me watch the sport even more even though I've been to many games locally over time and don't think
it's a bad sport. I like an Android. Having me in Wollongong saying, "Let's go to a game,
let's go to a game, let's go to a game." Oh, well, that would help. That would help. It
would be a good sort of social angle. If it were BattleBots? I hadn't thought of that,
but that's a good answer. I was going to say if people played basketball the way that Jim
Carey did in The Cable Guy, I would watch it. Okay. Have either of you seen that movie?
Mm-hmm. Long time ago. Where he goes absolutely nuts and like breaks the backboard or whatever
it's called and glass shatters everywhere and he's just a real arse about the whole thing.
I would watch the sport then.
- I reckon if we recorded an episode on our phone
at a game, that would be exciting.
- It would be great listening experience, yeah.
- The audio quality would be top notch.
- Just be, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,
bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, for a full 45 minutes.
Y'all ready for this?
(laughing)
- Shut it down, it's over, that's it.
(static)
*Hums the opening to the song*
This is the second recording. Yeah, we're in the future now. We're in the future
Yeah
We did record before the event and we didn't make predictions because we don't do that because we don't care
And now we're after the event which was the best pre-recorded event to date
Full stop. I don't know about that. I got thoughts
Bring it on keep in mind for anyone that's listening. They're both already. They hate everything, right?
And then now they're gonna be all sleepy and cranky because it's like 1 a.m. Or 4 a.m.
There respectively just ticked over to 5 a.m. Here 5 a.m. Now. It's nice even more cranky
So I would say like get out your salt because you're gonna need many grains of it for whatever they're both
So I'll clean it up at the end and let everyone know what is actually the truth, but go ahead, okay?
Well since I know I'm gonna tee off because I'm actually stealing Martin's thunder
And I hope he doesn't mind go for it. They move too bloody they move too bloody quick agreed
I don't know what's going on like oh come on now
So the last time you're complaining the event is too long and they go for too long about everything and now it's a nice fast
Pace and now you're gonna complain about that. I'm an old man waking up at one o'clock in the morning
Okay, just ease off and then just trying to get the event happening
You saw on the discord my efforts with Siri and Apple TV
Sure, they can release a two thousand five hundred dollar US laptop, but they can't make Siri
Work on their own product that exists to let me not sure why doesn't appear in Australia ever since they started these events
I've tried to subscribe to the events. They don't there's no banner that nothing exists in Australia. So I have to load YouTube
What do you mean? You said subscribe to it several times.
Is there like a thing you can do that's supposed to pop up or something?
So, for example, you've said there's supposed to be a banner.
There is no banner.
I've never had it ever since.
Like we're talking rebooting different devices never appears.
And then when I talk about subscribe, if, for example,
and this may not be the way it works, but you would think intuitively it would.
If you watch previous Apple events on the Apple TV app
and you subscribe to have that in your up next, you would think that
when you finish the previous one, a new one would load in,
but it's only for on-demand viewing.
It never actually pops up as an option to watch.
So I'm always like, oh God, where do I go?
I don't want to load up the homepage.
I'll go to YouTube and that's always reliable.
- Okay.
- I'm sure that Siri won't be able to get that right,
but we'll be able to get a $6.99 playlist.
Just bang on.
- Yeah, I don't, that was weird.
Some way to just have a cheaper tier, I guess,
is all I can really imagine.
I still feel like that tier should have just been free,
but like really limited.
So you could quote have Apple music, but not really.
And then you'd eventually be like annoyed enough
with the lacking stuff that you'd just be like,
I'll just get the 9.99 one.
- So I assume we get that.
We're all Apple premier.
- Yeah, so everything they announced about that is,
it's not as if this is something you'd have to pay
on top of what you already have if you have Apple music.
I think it was just described a little bit weird.
I think this is if you are a person that has nothing
in terms of Apple Music, you now have three options.
You can get the $4.99, which is just this weird version
of only being able to talk to it,
which I feel like didn't Spotify or something do that
in the past where there was a super cheap tier,
but you could only listen to it on the web,
not on device or something like that.
- And it was only ads, you only got to hear it.
I want to listen to rock. Oh wait, just the ads that go with rock. So it's like
Have you heard about Squarespace? We've got 24 hours. Yeah, you could build websites about trucks and guns
I find it hilarious. I find it hilarious that they
They went the gamut from here's our cheapest product to here's our most expensive product
In the one show for all the cheapskates
Here's some Apple music that you don't you might want to pay for just a little bit each month and then here's our pro machine
machines.
Weird.
Okay, so, speaking of pro machines, the new laptops, I don't think either of you are
in the market for a laptop.
No.
Right?
And I'm not either.
Doesn't mean I won't get one, obviously, but I did just get a new M1 MacBook Pro for work
like four or five months ago.
So and it's fine.
Like it's an M1.
It's my work computer, so honestly it's doing documents and email and nothing that's going
to push it to anything.
Granted, if it would have been a really low-end Intel one, I would have been sad.
So being an M1, it's fine.
My iMac is an M1.
Honestly it's fine.
I've never pushed this iMac.
I think I've told you guys already, I've only had the fans come on maybe twice on the iMac,
so it's probably okay.
But I think it sends a good direction for where the whole Apple Silicon stuff is going.
I mean, we knew there was gonna be a new one, but it was like, is it going to be 10% better
for an M2?
Which it's not an M2, it's, you know, M1 Pro, M1 Max.
But like these numbers, like, oh, it's 13 times the graphics performance.
like what we're used to seeing like 2x or maybe like a 2 point something x but
13x are you kidding me it's crazy yeah it's not the old Moore's Law it's like a
read reintroduction of the Moore's Law thing it's like a reset right where we
have it we're back in time but it's not like we're trying to catch up to
anything we're just blowing past everything that could have even been I
mean they're talking about here was the core i9 which like the i9 is the best of
the best from an Intel standpoint, at least for, you know, personal computers.
And it was just in the dust. I mean, I know their graphs are bullshit and, you
know, everybody uses bullshit graphs. So I'm not... whatever. You can get on them
about that if you want. But find me a company that doesn't have like stupid
graphs that make them look good. Obviously they're gonna do that. But man,
these things are just nuts. I want to ask you guys about the design because I
I found the design to be very interesting.
And the second I saw it,
I thought polycarbonate Mac books from back in the day,
they look just like that.
- The curve at the bottom,
the way that it tapered and that slight look of thickness.
I found that very pleasing.
- And those little feet,
how it's got the little feet again, I dig it.
And it says MacBook Pro on the bottom.
One of those things that nobody cares about,
but I just think I really like that.
You're not looking at the bottom of your laptop,
but I think it's really cool.
Like this M1 iMac I have right now,
it's going to last for so long.
It's gonna last way longer than I want it to.
I'm gonna have to give it to somebody else
just to justify getting something new at some point,
but they're crazy.
And oh, sorry, one other thing, 21 hours of battery life?
I'm sorry, what?
That, like, remember when everybody was like,
oh yeah, the iPad, 'cause it's got way better battery life
than the Mac, and then the Mac is like,
hey, how's it going?
you can charge me next week.
It's like, oh, okay, wow.
That's--
- 'Cause they normally present that
with running one particular app
or doing one particular thing.
Is that 21 hours on text edit or what's that?
- Even if it is, for like my work laptop,
I barely charge it as it is.
Now it's just like, charge it in every five or six days.
It's crazy.
- Actually, I have an important question for you, Jason,
'cause you were saying the iMac will last longer
than what you want it to.
Given that the whole pro thing is neutral colors,
how upset would you be if you were to buy
a pro level computer?
- Furious.
- And to lose the orange?
- Furious.
I hate everything about that.
I am so, the thing I'm the most,
so I know that Andrew hates them because of Safari.
- Yep.
- You, Martin, hate them because music, I guess.
I don't know, I'll just pick something.
My biggest beef is the fact that they did the iMacs in the most wonderful color set
once. They did phones, like the purple phone, for about eight days it felt like,
and then got rid of it and they went back to boring lame-ass colors.
I really thought when we got the iMacs that colors were gonna be a thing.
Anytime I've ever heard anybody talk about colors, they're like, "Give me a MacBook Pro
in yellow, in blue, whatever color.
You know what?
Make it an option, charge another $500 for it.
People will do it because they want the damn colors.
- They did that with the black, with the MacBook.
Black, do you remember that?
The black book?
- Yeah, it was $100 more.
I remember that.
Yeah, do that.
- Should we let Andrew go to sleep?
- No.
- Yeah, sounds good.
I probably won't now, lying in bed.
Maybe I'll listen to our podcast, fall asleep to it.
- There you go.
I do want to say
Everybody thanks for joining us in the discord. That was like a really active discord chat. It was fun
So it's good the whole discord in general the last few days has been like more than I can even keep up with which is
Not bad. It's just like
Crazy it's exploded and thank you to our newest arrivals for tolerating my hyper compressed
Account of Australian history. That was good. Yeah, I think some people may have been confused lately that they actually joined like an Australian history class
online
That just happens from time to time, just go with it, it's good information, it's good
to know, so enjoy.
It's a bonus, bonus for everyone, you don't even have to be a One Prime Plus member to
get that kind of content, that's just free.
Everyone needs to prepare for the test in December, that's all I have to say.
There will be finals, unannounced, unannounced finals corner.
iTunes U has gone away but there is still HBU.
the next one.
