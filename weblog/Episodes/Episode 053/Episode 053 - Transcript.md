Hi I'm Andrew and I'm Jason and I'm Martin this is hemispheric views.
You're supposed to do that before he's always doing such things because he knows that I'm going to pop up in my future it is a Martin it's as well by go.
Is it oh yeah it is.
And just on in economic corner I want to bring to the attention that people probably have heard that in the US in our northern hemisphere there's been an interest rate rise by the fed.
Similarly in Australia there's a good talking about the fed.
There is a bank Australia is is signaling that we should expect an interest rate rise in the coming months yeah previously talk about that being twenty twenty four that brought that that forecast way forward.
Concerns about an outbreak of inflation in the economy with suffered a long time with under inflation and now I think we're probably gonna find that we're going to an overinflationary environment.
Challenging is concerning and I am with everybody on this we are also doing a bit.
One prime plus dot com is not inflationary we're not putting our prices up now.
No no we're not what I love about that whole spiel listeners can't say that Andrew was waving a pen around the entire time he was talking so just had this it had this boardroom feel like I could feel the business flowing through me.
Can I also add to that that not only is he waving a pen around it's one of those bank pens so it has a little piece of chain coming off from where he took it from the bank.
Don't put it around your neck Andrew you might get a bit enthusiastic.
It's getting real over here in economic corner right out of the gate.
I hope you know that.
And it says Feld notes on it.
It's a Feld notes pen.
Yes.
Still to this day I don't get an email from them and not think that it says Feld notes every single time.
The Feld notes pencil.
Glad that I polluted your mind with that.
Feldnotes pencil.
That's an easy fix. That's just wood. You can just sand off the eye and you're good to go.
Speaking of spending though, did either of you order anything from Apple's recent
March event? Everyone else has already spoken about it. We're a bit late,
but did either of you actually buy anything?
Yeah, that was what, two weeks ago now or three weeks ago?
I slipped through it. I don't know.
Yeah, that was interesting because we usually do a little discord pow wow with everyone during
those type of events. And in the worst possible timing, right, I think maybe five minutes into
the event, discord just broke completely like worldwide, went down for everyone. So that was
interesting and annoying. But side tangent anyway, as far as buying things, the long answer is
no and the short answer is I did buy a watch band. Oh which one? The hmm the
naming I'm gonna get it wrong it's the solo braided loop solo loop braided
something some of those words are probably accurate in flamingo. Very nice.
Oh and you're wearing it right now wow that is. It's like the brightest pink you
could ever see it's fantastic.
That's quite nice actually.
I think it's solo braided loop.
Is that the fluoroelastom?
What's that?
No, this is the one that's like the little pieces of rope.
Oh, okay.
Right.
Braided together.
Yeah.
Not the fluoroelastom.
The fluoroelastom one is like the sport band one.
Yeah.
Or the sport loop or whatever it is.
Solo loop.
Just not the braided one.
Nice.
Yeah.
That was all I got.
Well, I guess, uh, within the household, we do have a studio display coming as well.
Ooh, Valerie ordered a lovely studio display vase amount.
Okay.
Nano textured screen.
I just want to ask quickly though, Valerie with the vase amount, is that going to be from the desk or is she going to go for like a kind of dental or surgery set up with something from the ceiling?
From the desk, we both have desks that the Jarvis fully, fully Jarvis, Jarvis fully,
whatever, they go up and they go up and down the like the stand.
Isn't, isn't Jarvis the computer that controls Iron Man?
Yes, so we use him as our desk because he's just,
he's a little antiquated nowadays with the M1 Ultra being a thing.
So.
And since they wrapped up that particular part of the franchise,
you know, in the game and everything, they had to relocate him somewhere.
So now he's in desks.
Yeah he's like the old big cray computers that look cool but they're just useless so we just use it as a desk.
I don't like tape reels and stuff.
So you have one of those giant tubes like the classic sort of office environment.
I don't know I can I confess for a minute you can't really understand I don't really understand vase of vase amounts I've never really lived with one.
I'm all I know is them is it like they have tubes and then they have like an angle bar.
And they sort of go up and down spin around but there was not really shonky they can and the only ones I've ever seen are in work environments where they've just gone for the cheapest.
Possible thing so ever my my sort of impression of these amount is I would be scared to use one for fear of snapping and dropping my expensive Apple monitor.
So, point of clarification, the VESA mount is actually just the standard for which the
monitor attaches to a thing.
It's basically a fancy way of saying there's four holes and they're X millimeters apart
in a square.
Oh, okay.
So that's all that is.
So the arm, the VESA mount itself, yeah, you can get one that's 14 cents and will probably,
you'll walk in one day and your monitor will be on the floor.
And then you can go all the way up to, you know, however much you want to spend on one.
So there's the full range.
Most of them are garbage, but you can get ones that you would feel comfortable putting
even a XDR display on and it would be fine.
Okay.
But then you have full adjustability of height, tilting, doing whatever you want with it.
And yeah.
Okay.
So Martin, go.
So I was in a state of serious mental turmoil over whether I should buy a studio display
and I was on the verge of buying one.
Because you have an M1, you have a mini, right?
You've got like the perfect computer for it.
You have the M1 mini.
Yes.
Yes.
Now, the thing is I have what is actually a very decent and I like it.
It's a 4K display by Samsung, not 5K obviously like the studio display.
There's nothing technically wrong with it.
The thing that appealed to me about the studio display was actually the enhancement with
the height adjustable stand in addition to the tilt.
because, you know, ergonomically it makes you kind of sit up straight, you know, because
it's higher up, you're not doing this lean forward business.
But then I was thinking, God, I've bought quite a bit of Apple stuff recently.
And in Australia, even with discounts, when you added that stand, it's on the way to $3,000.
Like it's huge.
And I was thinking, well, why would I go and buy something right now without at least having
reviews out to look at it?
And then there was this whole other thing, and this is more of a first world thing, but
why that's a lot of money for a display and all the videos I'm taking now, particularly
for family are in HDR quality.
This doesn't have it.
Is that a problem?
Would I ever notice?
So I haven't written off buying it.
I am like thinking about it constantly, to be honest.
But I thought no, step back, actually think about it before just throwing cash.
So I haven't bought one yet.
We'll put it that way.
above the shoot from the hip type of range of money, for sure.
- Yeah.
And the funny thing is that a lot of the American reviewers
who are covering it, I think they've been very fair.
Some people have said, "No, this is great.
"This isn't so great.
"Wait for that software update with the camera," and so on.
And they can only really comment
on their own pricing in the US.
But I sit there watching and I go,
"I need to find some more Australian
"or New Zealander reviewers who go,
"This will cost you a good chunk of your salary
"and maybe one of your digits."
Yeah, yeah, it's a little different than people here being like, yeah, it's fairly affordable at $15.99.
Yeah.
And you're like, yeah, how about double that?
Yeah.
Pretty much.
Yeah, it does hurt.
I don't know. I think I just need to be a bit more realistic and sensible about it. So we'll see how I go in future episodes.
So the Mac Studio there is $1.5 million. Is that roughly accurate?
Starting, yes.
Yeah, starting.
Yeah, I did a quick-
I did.
Not even for the old-
I had to look at it real quick without doing any configurations.
I just looked at sort of the base, the two default models.
Yeah. And it was starting at 3,100 or something like that.
And then the other one was 6,000.
Well, it's huge. That's a lot of money.
Yeah. Oh, wow.
And look, I'll say, I think it's great that they've introduced these models.
I think it's really good that they're committing to people who want to do creative stuff.
I don't use the word professional because that's loaded and people have different ideas,
but people who want to do more creative stuff that requires a bit more power.
It's great that people are being served in that way.
Now, I just think sometimes Apple could maybe remember that, you know, not everyone can
necessarily afford the entire puzzle that you have to put together to make said package.
Each thing on its own seems just reasonable, but you put it together and it's huge.
I'm just still amazed the fact that the Mac studio is like,
we flashback just a few years when there was the,
when the Mac pro came out and then every blog post was about this thing can be
$46,000 and it was like,
and now this thing is just like leaves that in the dust and it was a mere couple
of years ago. Yeah. And it's one, I don't know how much smaller is,
1/10 the size, you could carry it with you if you wanted to,
without wheels that were another $500.
It's just, it's bonkers.
This is the most extreme thing we've seen so far.
And we're still on M1, like the first one.
- I have not bought anything from that event either.
And I don't, the monitor would be the only thing
I'd be interested in.
But the M1 series itself is still totally fine.
For the things I do on the computer, it's fine.
I never hit the ceiling on that thing.
I'm talking to you today on an iMac,
which is still the Intel iMac,
and it's what, 3.1 gigahertz, six core i5.
And it's fine.
I don't have a problem with this thing.
I feel better about the fact that the monitor in this
is the same one as what's in the new monitor.
So that makes me feel a little bit okay about things.
So I haven't bought anything,
Although I am getting pressure from my wife, Hannah.
She works from an M1 MacBook Air
and she tends to put it on a little riser
and then use a magic keyboard and have it in front of her.
But she does suffer from not having
a reasonable size monitor.
She saw that and said, "Hang on a second."
(laughing)
And I'm not-
- Oh, so she's still using,
she's just using the built-in display just up on the stand.
That's right.
OK, got it.
Natasha does the same thing.
She likes that.
And Hannah doesn't mind it, but it's only the 13-inch air.
You know, it's not a big monitor by any means.
I know she's constantly toggling between screens and things like that.
So I think that will be a really nice upgrade for her.
And I think we will probably end up getting one.
And I feel OK about it because I had the old cinema display.
Forever.
Forever.
It was like, yeah, 10 years that thing lasted.
I don't see why this one won't last an equivalent period of time.
So, it's expensive.
I would probably end up as getting the non-height adjustable because I'm tight,
but I might spend on the nanotexture.
You just throw a block of wood under there.
It's fine.
Exactly.
I've got dictionaries.
Do you know what I'm most excited about when I hear that you might buy this, Andrew?
Something we haven't made fun of you about for a while.
I remember that you were very, very panicked, or at least mildly stressed about the depreciation over time with your old display.
Oh yeah yeah.
So to add it and then here in like a decade's time if we're still doing this show I am so excited for the future to hear just how miserable you are about the economic implications of that display.
Yeah it's just gonna be like you know what I got the height adjustable and it's still costing me $8 a week.
I've just brought up the spreadsheet now that cinema display just to remind people it cost me $1299 on the 15th of January 2011.
I got rid of it for $200 on 8th of February 2021 so overall it cost me a $1099 right that is $2.09 per week.
That's what you're looking at and this was gonna be more expensive so I even put it through.
But it has a camera and speakers.
I actually went through and did one of those age of my I said what is this this monitor in current I did the currency conversion for time basically to figure out is this equivalent it basically is there's not much difference in it so.
Yeah and that's why when people say Apple products are getting more expensive that's not always true things do adjust over time for me it's always that.
Why does the entire package in order to make it usable have to be so much when you put it all together.
Yeah just clarify so if the entire event with these brand new amazing chips in one ultras fuse together.
Silicon incredible stuff the hemisphere views crew came out with one watch band.
Yes.
I wanted to bring up an article that I saw floating around the place, connected in tweets
mainly. And it was actually linked to stuff that's going on with, you know, sadly, Russia
and Ukraine at the moment. And it was this point about how, in Russia, you know, Moscow
particularly, things linked to Apple or Google Pay had been shut down because of everything
that's going on with Russia at the moment and what they're doing, at least their government,
how private corporations or publicly traded corporations like Apple and Google have this
kind of hold over public infrastructure. So there was this shot that was shared of all of these
railway passengers who couldn't get through the turnstiles because their devices wouldn't work
with things. Some people disputed whether it was true. I found some articles to say that it was
true and you know, they'd verified it, but it was more the extent that might have been misreported.
Either way, I thought it brought up an interesting point about how much we depend
on companies that aren't part of the state, you know, corporations and this digital stuff on our
wrists, in our pockets, on our desks, for stuff that we do every day, which might have once been
the responsibility of the state or taxpayer funded things. What do you two think about this? Because
the thing that came up for me was I, as an example, thought I'm going to shift to the watch
with things like payment and wallets and stuff. And if I can leave my wallet at home, that's
great or maybe not even use my phone. I'm going to be traveling in a minimalist way. But now I'm
thinking maybe I should carry some cash around occasionally for that emergency. Maybe starting
with you, Jason, what do you think about all this? Yeah, I think for the most part, this is
a big deal in light of what's going on. But I don't think this is a new problem, per se. I mean,
this could be said for any time frame under any kind of worldview that we're in. Everything can be
going along great and XYZ company can just decide,
yeah, we don't want to do that anymore
and now your stuff doesn't work.
So I don't know, this has always been an issue
and this maybe is just an example to remind us that,
keeping everything in XYZ company is maybe not
going to be as foolproof as we thought.
For the most part, stuff generally works day to day
but any given month it seems like you will be online
and it's like, oh, half the internet has stopped working.
What happened?
Oh, AWS went down or like something,
like some backbone went down
and now all of the self-driving taxis have stopped working.
So it's like, whether it's on purpose or not,
this is just a general problem that needs to be dealt with.
And I mean, the internet was mostly designed
to work around those problems,
but most of the infrastructure built on top of the internet
that's supposed to work around problems
is not built in that way.
It's built to work a very specific way
that that company wants to, you know,
maximize shareholder value or whatever.
I get it, and I think this is one of those examples
that has maybe changed the narrative a little bit
around what companies can control
in when there's like hostile situations like this.
But I just, I'm not sure that this is anything new.
And I have to imagine this has probably been true
throughout time, right?
Where you don't own the railway
and then the railway company decides,
yeah, we're not letting trains through today.
Well, shit, that just ruined a lot of people's days.
So I don't know.
I think it's definitely an issue,
but I think it's a larger issue that we need to look at
in terms of how much are we willing
to let go of control of our stuff
for the convenience of having it held by a corporation.
- What do you think, Andrew?
- I've picked up my pen,
'cause I feel like I almost am ready to go on a major rant
about neoliberalism and the damage it may be doing
to society on a broader level.
- Go for it, I'm ready for the pen.
- I can't wait for this.
- I don't think I should do it though.
I don't think this is the forum.
People don't wanna hear that, do they?
But because I've got the pen,
I'm feeling very intelligent holding this pen
and waving it around.
Changes me changes my mentality entirely I'm gonna start doing this on a regular now just having a pen the pen truly is my deal in the sword.
Jesus I think what is this is this is an indicator like you said of how much we have.
Delivered parts of ourselves to corporations.
But and this in the case was apple and google but i think you go step back i think the larger problem is you would say we have.
Devolved our lives to visa and mastercard because all of those payment gateways end up going through visa and mastercard right and we don't use cash anymore it's positively.
Look frowned upon to use cash because you might also be transmitting transmitting a dose of covid as you pay for your meat pie.
Basically you got these payment gateways that are managing the entire world economy so.
Which brings me to another political point now is why the heck aren't these a mastercard also stepping out of the Russian economy.
If they really want to make it.
Statement we know that Nestle hasn't stepped out yet now I am jumping all over the place here and probably not answering your question man but I've got the pen so I'm on it.
I'm on a ramp.
What's that pen gets picked up?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
But yeah, okay, so let me get back to the question, which was, have we given ourselves over to corporations too much? Is that kind of the question? That's a big part of it. Yeah.
Yeah, I think we have.
It's not a new phenomenon, but it's a more apparent one these days because the level of monopoly and oligopoly that we're experiencing now, where there's just a handful of players,
to absolutely dominate and dominate at a global level like it used to be a region maybe a country
level or a state level or you know things were regionalized but now these companies are big
enough that they are global monsters and yeah they are basically more powerful than states
they have a greater GDP than many countries apple's turnover is bigger than many countries
i don't have the stats in front of me but i've heard it said before so yeah i think it's a real
of concern. You could say a government, for example, let's say the federal government of
Australia, that would be in a sense an ultimate monopoly, right? If you want to talk about very
basic business terms, it is the overarching ruler of the country and it makes the policies and the
laws very much like a corporation would. The difference is that when we pay tax or we vote,
if something goes wrong, there's generally in an idealistic sense, this idea that if something goes
wrong, they are accountable and we have some method of voting them out or changing things
if they don't work or they shut down. With a corporation, other than the push and the sway
of shareholders, if Apple decides to switch something off or do something particularly
egregious, we don't have that power even though we have technically voted for them in an economic
sense by buying their devices and paying for their services. So they do the same thing. They run
different forms of infrastructure. For me, the thing that's uncomfortable about it is that they
don't necessarily have that level of accountability, or we don't have that level to influence them the
same way that we would with our own government. Yeah, I think that's part of the, I mean, that's
the only thing I would say to that is that you know that going into it, that was not a surprise.
We did not go in having voting rights and then at some point that was switched off.
Upon entering a contract with them, I'm sure we actually probably did enter an actual contract by
checking some box, but...
South Park covered the iTunes terms and conditions a while ago.
I think so, yeah.
So it's like, yes, you're correct, but this was all known going into it and it's 100%
of...
Does that make it okay, though?
Absolutely.
If it does or it doesn't, I feel like it's kind of irrelevant.
It's a choice that was made knowingly by each of us.
And you could say, well, we have to have this device or that device.
And yes, that's somewhat true to an extent, but it is a known thing.
This is not a surprise.
We don't go in blind.
I think we go in blind, willingly blind, because we choose to just say, well, I'd rather have
the cool thing or the fun thing or the whatever thing.
And I kind of don't care about the other stuff until it becomes a problem.
And then it's like, oh, shit.
Now I care.
But I'm already in.
So, you know, there's this like, oh, I'm in so deep now.
I've got all this stuff.
I can't leave.
Like also not true, you can, whether you can financially or whatever, you can physically
leave and stop using all of their stuff tomorrow.
Is that an easy decision?
Absolutely not.
So most people don't.
But I still think there is at least a little bit of hope there in the sense that yes, you
can vote in the sense of like, pick a, I'm not even gonna use a real company.
Let's just say there is a company you buy a lot of stuff from, you've been using them
forever, they do a lot of stuff that makes you mad and you rage tweet about it all day
long.
It's like the way you're going to enact any change is by leaving the platform.
If you don't like the way that they control what you're doing, you leave.
It's going to be painful.
They may or may not feel anything from you leaving individually.
But as enough people leave, the thing that's going to make them care is, we used to make
this much, now we make this much, what the hell happened? And it's a slow process. It's
not gonna be fast. But I'm rambling now a little bit just because it gets to be a little
bit, I guess, tiresome of when we hear so much of the complaining about all these companies,
but yet then we don't do anything about it. We just kind of complain and say, "Hey, we're
why don't you change? And I understand that is a method, but at some point you have to understand
that maybe that's not going to work and the option is going to be maybe more painful for you.
But at the end of the day, if you feel better about it, then you're better off for it.
You've actually reminded me of a point that was in, if you've ever read or heard of the book,
Sapiens. Have either of you read that? I have read it.
I have heard of it. I've not read it yet. Great book. I'm pretty sure it's in that one
of the three that Harari wrote, but he made this point that the only thing that really
binds together all of humanity in a form of trust, so that can make any stranger trust
another stranger is money. And the point you made there about the only way that an individual
can really enact change, particularly when it concerns corporations or neoliberal entities,
like Andrew said, is take your money elsewhere. So I think by and large, like you were saying,
people complained about these companies. I'm generally very satisfied personally with a
lot of things that Apple does or at least says that it's doing. It could
always improve. Every tech company particularly or any other kind of company
really can improve but I think you're exactly right. The only thing that will
really make all of them sit up and take notice or do something differently is if
the money is seen to disappear because money is truth. And just um you brought
up the book Sapiens. I just to add to the Hemispheric Views book corner I just
recently finished a book called The Value of Everything Making and Taking in
Global Economy by Mariana Mazzucato. Quite a mouthful all of that. But it's
really interesting. It talks about where do we consider corporations versus
government and who's creating value, who's a rent seeker. We put up on a
pedestal the idea of bankers and banking corporations for instance. But are they
truly creating value or are they just rent seekers in the economy clipping the
ticket on the way through. A really interesting book, thought provoking and probably a little bit aligned to this conversation.
There we go.
So, Andrew's done two things accidentally really well.
He's accidentally brought in Andrew Recommends all over again, and you did awesome homework for the segment.
Didn't mean to do it.
Just, you know, a sign of my murdering.
Plus, we have Book Corner now.
Yeah. And I recommend it.
So, if I recommend it, I need to give it a certain number of thumbs.
I will give this book three and a half thumbs.
Yeah.
It gets- - Okay.
- It starts off with a bang, gets going, gets a little bit, a little bit dry in this, you know, the last second third of the book, push on.
There you go, three and a half.
So ironically, as you push on, it presents less value.
Yes.
Yeah, I think it's, I think it was probably written in the sense that nobody will actually get to the end of this book, right?
They'll read the first bit and put it down and never come back to it.
I actually read the whole thing.
Yeah, the last four chapters were literally just lorem ipsum.
And I was like, this is weird.
Do you know if you read enough lorem ipsum it's like severance and the numbers and you start to get a feel for them.
So Jason you did something with a 13 inch iPad.
Boy did I I'm gonna screw up a lot of the terminology here but I work from home now a hundred percent of the time.
And I'm at my little command center here which is my iMac and working from home means you have basically one option for.
physically talking to people if you need to,
which is something like a Zoom, right?
And I found it to be annoying that I would have,
much like I'm looking at right now talking to you guys,
I have the Zoom up at the top with the little windows,
which kind of takes up a quarter to a third of my screen.
So if I wanna be looking at other documents or whatever,
they're kinda now real short and at the bottom.
It's not ideal.
So here's what I'm doing.
I have taken a 13 inch iPad,
which I don't really use for anything anymore.
And that is now mounted on top of my iMac.
- What?
- As an external display.
- On the top?
- On the top.
- How?
- So right above the camera,
so that now if I look up at the screen,
which is now my dedicated like zoom window,
the camera is still right there.
so I'm still looking at everyone.
They're all up in a box.
I have my full desktop to do whatever else I need to do.
No impact on me.
And I have it plugged in with a USB-C cable,
so it's USB-C connected sidecar,
so there's like no input lag at all.
It's perfect.
And it works from control center.
The super cool thing, I was really concerned.
I was like, ah, shoot, I'm gonna have this iPad up there.
I'm gonna have like a burned in menu bar on it
'cause it's gonna be sitting up there not being used.
If you just hit the power button on the iPad,
the screen will go to sleep, doesn't lose connection,
it's still connected as a full display.
So as soon as you just tap the screen,
it's instantly back on, no reconnecting, no nothing.
It's not an ugly monitor,
it fits the aesthetic of my iMac nicely.
I didn't even know that you could do that.
I mean, I knew you could do it,
just never really tried it and it is phenomenal as a second monitor it's
gorgeous. Can we just get back a step? Yes. When you're running zoom are you running
zoom on the iPad like the zoom? On the iPad? No, no, no I'm just I'm using the iPad
truly as an external monitor so it's a secondary monitor. So this is this is
sidecar like you said it's not universal control? Not universal control it is
sidecar. And so what do you put up in that top you put the heads you put the
zoom heads in that iPad window.
I put the whole, everything that zoom lives up there.
It's 13 inch screen, plenty big to see whatever's going on.
And if the reason I don't just do zoom on a separate iPad is
inevitably, Oh, I need to share something now, but I'm on my iMac.
Like now I'm on two separate things.
How does that function?
None of that.
It's just a nice external display.
How much BluTack are you using to mount an iPad above an iMac?
So this is going to be an Elgato, for whatever their arm thing is called.
And then that goes to a magnetic mount that connects to that.
So it just magnets to it and it just sits up there and that's it.
I don't get it. I don't get how it's hanging onto an iMac.
It's not physically touching the iMac.
It's levitating grossfully.
It's quite literally levitating right above my iMac without touching it so it doesn't interfere with any of the
microphones or
Cooling or any of that stuff. I'll send you some diagrams
I'll put some diagrams and photos so you can see how to visualize how it's you say it's floating
What's it attached to is it a visa mount? What's going on? I'm confused kind of it's kind of a vase amount
Yeah, yeah, basically.
I say visa, I say visa wrong, don't I?
Visa, visa, tomato, tomato.
I say it like the credit card.
Yeah.
But the takeaway here.
Caught up in the detail, right?
The takeaway is that an iPad connected via USB is an outstanding external monitor.
And I was a little worried about like the lag.
And then I was worried that if the screen went to sleep, it was going to think that
the monitor disconnected and all of that.
But with all the M stuff, like remember back on Intel, Andrew, you're familiar
with Intel.
Am I ever?
Um, when you would, when you would connect or disconnect a monitor, it would
like your screens would all flash and turn off and all that crap.
Yep.
And then with all of the new Apple silicon stuff, all that went away.
It's just connect, you're done.
Disconnect, you're done.
Nothing happens.
We're finally in a position now where external monitors are fantastic to
connect to computers.
It only took us till 2022.
Well, I'm keen to see this in the show notes.
Maybe chapter artwork.
That's good.
I don't think most people care about this stuff.
Given some of the meetings I'm sure people are in, you can tell people don't care.
I like it to be as nice as possible.
Thank you.
I hope none of your colleagues is listening to this.
I don't, I don't mean my meetings.
I mean, other people that are listening right now, I'm sure are in meetings every day where there's, you know, the nose cam and the, they're looking at a different direction.
And most people don't even have their camera on, which is annoying in a whole nother respect.
But yeah, it's great.
So if you need a little external monitor action, do it.
It's fantastic.
Okay.
Can I suggest you do a blog post about this?
I think this is worthy of...
I could do a blog post about that.
I could do a oneprimeplus.com newsletter about it as well.
Okay.
For April.
I don't even have a pen right now.
And I'm businessing.
You don't use a second screen at all, do you Martin?
You have no second screen?
No, I've done it like at work before. This is in the pre-pandemic days, but I've never liked it.
To me, it's ergonomically off. It seems wasteful with space on the desk. I respect people need more
space and they might like it, but things are off-centre. Do you put them angled towards you
and you're never really looking straight ahead? To me, one rectangle, large, enough.
Agreed.
Cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm the same way I literally only do this so that I can keep that one screen to content.
And the fact that it's centered above your display makes sense as well because to the side is like this what am I doing it's tangled with it.
I've got a second monitor here it's a Dell which Hannah yeah she wants the new Apple one she rejected this Dell 24 inch 4k thing I actually can't blame her.
Can't blame her it's really annoying and never seems to be the right resolution.
Was that like a 28 cm bezel on that thing.
The best actually not bad and it can rotate I had it for a while it on a portrait orientation course you did spreadsheet guy.
It's like a missed opportunity in your household you should call it a diesel.
Boy okay let's move on and he's editing so that's staying in you betcha.
That segways to a nice next topic about uttering sorry I think you need a sorry after that joke Martin fell I am hugely intrigued by this.
What's my topic but I won't be apologizing for anything what what's up Jason.
I've been looking at this topic for four weeks now and I please tell us more.
Cool.
Well, I thought this was a weird...
Cool story. Moving on.
Cool. No, I was taking in your point.
Mm-hm. Yep, I got it.
I'm glad that it's intrigued you.
Go ahead, Marques.
I think it's an interesting cultural point,
and I wanted to know particularly if Andrew could relate to it
and if Jason could rebut it or say that maybe Americans are similar or not.
So something that I've noticed is that when you go to a cafe in Australia, right, or a restaurant,
or a McCafe, there is, yes, there is a very high degree of apology, frequent apologies unnecessarily.
Yep, that's right for everything. Right. So sorry, question from who to who is this customer to
customer customer actually goes both ways between customer and staff, but particularly from staff.
And I'm talking about all ages. Not everyone does it, but it's pretty frequent. And I noticed it
recently where we were waiting two or three minutes to be seated when people were busy.
We got a sorry for that. We sat down, all of the cutlery in the bucket with a little pail in the
middle of the table hadn't been replenished exactly on time. We got a sorry for that.
They didn't come straight away with the menus, and we got a sorry for that. But we're talking
about minimum amount of time and then we waited a reasonable amount of time for our food and
drinks because surprise surprise everything had to be prepared after we ordered it and we got a
sorry for how long it took. Sorry. It's just constant sorries and I thought I'm someone who
probably apologizes too much. I remember even being in year six at one point and being told
by the teacher in front of everyone Martin you apologize too much and I unwittingly or
I intentionally said sorry in front of the class for doing it. And I think, is that an Australian thing? So, Andrew, first of all, does this exist in Perth, this frequent apology rather than thanking for patience or it's like everyone's always at fault.
I mean, I'm also an over-apologer and I've noticed my son has inherited the same trait and we're sort of trying to square that because I realize that's a, you don't want to be that because I'm that guy. Don't be that guy. Don't always apologize.
But yes there is I've got the pen back there is too much.
It's back there to this too much apologizing going on and you're right every experience in a cafe is attached to it some sort of apology sorry.
I think Jason's first initial reaction might be this is probably a showlings defensiveness against the Karen.
But I think the sorry predates the Karen. I don't think we're worried that Martin
Feld is going to turn into Karen because he had to wait a minute for his food or his
cutlery wasn't there. It really is, I think, a cultural thing that we apologize.
"Oh, sorry, mate. Oh, sorry." I can think back to recently in a cafe, similar experience,
and there was me and another person, and you're kind of forming a half line because you're kind
kind of waiting to take your order but it's a bit it's not a clearly defined line and you do that oh
sorry sorry oh yeah you're trying to look at the food the little food and little window cabinet
thing oh sorry sorry and yeah there's a lot of apologizing so martin i think you've nailed it
i think you found something that is particularly australian i doubt it's american totally habitual
i i'm gonna go out and say americans won't do this they'll just be like i'm not apologizing
and that chump, I think Americans are much more self-confident and they wouldn't be apologizing.
Wow, okay. Well, I think the first thing I would say is that there's two different versions of
this. There is the overly apologetic person. I would say I fall into that category, just that
mostly when it's warranted, or at least I feel that it's warranted if I,
You know, if you bump into somebody, sorry about that.
You know, no big deal.
If it's something like the food took a reasonable amount of time to come,
I think that's just part of customer service.
It's just a standard thing.
No one's actually sorry for anything.
It's just become a thing that you say just in case the person happened to not be,
Like it's a disarming thing of on the off chance they did care that there was only three knives in the bucket and not seven.
Then it's fine. It kind of puts them on the defensive now to say, Oh, no, no, it's okay. It's okay. Don't don't worry about it. Right? It kind of sets you up to be disarmed. So I don't think a lot of that is very intentional in terms of being sorry. That being said, I think it happens here quite a lot. It's obviously going to change where you go.
Okay.
But I feel like that's fairly common in terms of most people do that. Oh, the other thing,
I think I forgot to say the second half of that is the group that will use the sorry
as a way to do something wrong anyway. Like, what's an example?
Can they get out of jail free cod or something?
Yeah, like they cut in line and they go, "Oh, sorry about that." And then they just stay there
there and you're like, so that's just like, you're fine now?
We're good?
Oh, okay.
So there's kind of that sorry too, which is subtle, but annoying compared to the one
that's just like, ah, sorry, I didn't give you enough menus or sorry, your, you know,
coffee is not good or whatever.
So yeah, I think, I think that's pretty common though.
I don't think that's really, I don't find that to be weird in terms of you guys saying
that.
Maybe, maybe it isn't culturally unique.
I do feel like it is happening more and more frequently though, and I kind of wonder
if it's a, like it sounds like a bad thing to me that someone should do that because
if I go in I would rather be thanked for my patience or given a positive
reinforcement or message because then you feel like oh, you know, this is a positive place and they're very confident about themselves
and if you constantly apologize, then it's actually implicitly suggesting that
that something was always wrong.
Like you're in this cafe experience
where things are constantly going,
yeah, that did take a little while.
I imagine that some people wouldn't be so forgiving.
And after the 15th, sorry, at this cafe visit,
you go, wow, like a lot went wrong during that time.
Whereas if it was, oh, thanks for coming
and oh, thank you for waiting.
I'll show you to your seat now.
It just has a different vibe about it.
And maybe it's even, maybe it has increased,
if I'm not imagining it.
I think people generally are becoming more impatient.
You know, there's this whole thing that people won't stay
for beyond two seconds of a YouTube video
that they're not interested in.
People expect instant gratification and service.
So maybe like you say, Jason, it is just to be disarming
because it's out of the way, people won't run away.
- I think maybe the larger, it's not a problem,
but the thing that it tends to do unknowingly
is that it will now draw attention to something
that probably wasn't an issue to begin with,
where it's like, oh, sorry about that.
And you're like, oh, I didn't even,
I mean, me personally, I'm like, I was oblivious.
I didn't even know that there were no forks.
Okay, sure.
I know like in previous jobs,
that was always a big issue for me personally.
It drove me a little nuts if you'd be in a meeting
or whatever, and like there was some kind of issue
was something like the pick whatever,
like the slides didn't work right or something.
And then for the remainder of the day,
everyone had to consistently,
"Oh, sorry about those technical difficulties earlier."
And it's like, "That happened two hours ago.
Everyone forgot. Move on.
All you're doing is bringing it back up to everybody."
So there's that issue too, where it's like,
Sometimes just doesn't need to be said.
It's fine.
Everyone knows. - Once is enough.
- Yeah, we're good, but.
- Do you know, actually, your office example is great,
but just back to the cafes for a second.
Do you know who I think really needs to apologize?
Table manufacturers.
- Yeah.
- Because there's always at least one table
that you get stuck with, right?
And you think the year is 2022 and it's rocking, right?
Do you have a ruler or a measuring tape?
Do you have industrial machinery
with pinpoint laser precision that will enable
all table legs to be the same height or length.
And then on top of that,
who are these people who are creating flaws
that if the table is correct and is properly made,
that it makes it rock.
Why is this a thing?
- Also, we've known about the tripod for a very long time.
- Yeah.
- We don't need four legs.
Three, that's gonna fix almost all those issues.
- Yeah, exactly.
You go with a tripod for your camera.
It doesn't have four legs.
You're trying to balance on the side of a cliff.
No, it's got three 'cause it works everywhere.
So just make all your tables with three legs.
- McDonald's even addressed this issue
by just giving it like the monopod treatment
and sticking it straight into the floor.
- Oh yeah. - Like you can't even
hold it down. - Yeah.
- No, that's not going anywhere.
Earthquake, doesn't matter.
- Nobody's stealing that table.
- Nor would you want to.
- No, maybe I'd want one, I don't know, we'll see.
Like that yellow color.
Well, I'm very happy with your reactions to that. I thought there would be responses and
thoughts. And I'm interested to know what other listeners think. I'm not going to set
homework because I think I've become a bit notorious for that. For those who listen to
this show, if you have thoughts, please feel free, you know, please feel free to share
them. There's no expectation from me. I'm not even going to apologize for previous times,
because that would be too much. Yeah, I'm seeking to improve in the future.
If you want to send us an apology though, you can do that. That's okay. Yeah, it doesn't even have to be for anything. Just send an apology. Just a quick sorry would be much appreciated. And we'll say, it's fine. Don't worry about it. I've got media corner. Right. It's turbo media corner. It's gonna take 30 seconds. Ready?
Turbo media corner.
Set a timer for 30 seconds.
Going are we going go go I went to the cinemas I went out in the world I saw a movie called uncharted I knew nothing of the movie where was this was this in Perth this is in Perth don't take my 30 seconds.

End of media corner thank you so much Andrew this has been a great segment now let you.
Let you know it's done sorry sorry go ahead sorry.
Did you even say the name of the movie I'm not even sure if we can't.

Of a thumb, but it is still from the thumb yeah, yeah, yes, it's the it's the thumbnail oh
Okay, I just want to make sure we're not into venturing into like other
- Because you have to do calculations and there's a map involved. - No, no, no, no.
- Keep it. - Okay.

- Yeah.
- This is triggering.
Okay.
Sorry.
- So Uncharted, there you go.

- There you go.
Check out his unboxed or whatever that website's called, where you do movie reviews.
- I think I might have put one out there.
- It's UnboxD.
- I do my...
- I do reviews on that.
Unbox? Letterboxd.
I knew it was something with a box.
Okay.
New Zealanders made that.
Did you review that one?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Do you actually write reviews or are you just like a star?
I write one.
I try and do a one sentence for most movies.
I did.
I watched a movie last night and just gave it stars.
Couldn't even be bothered writing a sentence.
Wow.
Jason, don't you remember when I had my no blinking silent response to his Matrix sentences on there?
It was like, "Movie was shit, more albinos, pls."
(laughing)
(laughing)
