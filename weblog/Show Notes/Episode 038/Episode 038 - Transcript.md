[Music]
I know, I was just thinking in my head that this was sooner yet somehow it feels like it's been
multiple, multiple weeks but...
See, time has been melting but I do want to say something
because we were checking the calendar recently for other purposes
This is Natasha and I. Yeah. And I wanted to bring up something with Andrew relatively early in this conversation because we looked ahead and we saw
That next week on the 27th of September. It's the Queen's birthday in Western Australia
Now happy birthday. That's the thing now the reason I bring this up for particularly for our northern hemispherian listeners Americans and so on
Queen's birthday kind of just is a bit willy-nilly in Commonwealth countries Commonwealth nations
WA has a different one from New South Wales and then Natasha went on a bit of a
Spelunking journey through the internet and then found that it is the governor of Western Australia who decides when the Queen's birthday is
So Andrew does that mean that your father-in-law decides when it's the Queen's birthday?
Well when you put it that way, yes, apparently he does
I'm so confused can he arrange for there to be two birthdays? I think that would be
Really cool if we could get that. Well, that's why I'm bringing up. He's got some sway
Can you arrange for more Queens birthdays in Australia?
Consider it done, sir
Can we get like two or three a month, please?
Wait, so is it more about deciding?
Not so much that the birthday is
You know October or whatever. It's more that it's like oh this year it falls on a
Sunday, so we're gonna observe the birthday on a Monday or is it literally the date changes every year?
I think there is a definitely a bit of that observance. You never have a public holiday on a weekend. That's honest
No, you don't want to you don't want to waste it
I mean, you're like throwing it in the garbage if it's on a weekend
But then the other element is basically it's just when's a big spell without a public holiday
So it's like a floating holiday like like a company floating holiday. Yeah, just chuck it. Yeah. I love me a floating holiday
You attach the Queen's name to it or at least her title and then everyone goes. Oh, thank goodness
We're still part of the monarchy saved us from that dreary long spell and gave us a day
Oh, we continue that was actually a thing Martin. That was in the the
Republican debate that we had probably before you were born
There was significant concern that Australians would lose a public holiday if we if we lost our monarchy
You're talking about the referendum in 99. Yeah, they go. Don't worry. I was alive
I was alive, although not terribly aware of what was going on
And then discussed it afterwards when I found out how it went if we're not talking about
Referendums within the first four minutes in the show. What is this show even really?
Right, so job done. We should rename our show constitutional monarchies
Probably and that was Commonwealth Corner. Thank you
I should just deal with this. I don't know where...
Okay, so I had to undergo a surgical procedure, which is part of the reason why we're recording late
It also means that I can't really move my face as effectively as I would like to and when I do move my face
It hurts, so I'm having to be very deadpan
I've spent the last few days, my children have been saying funny things over the last few days cracking me up
And I can't laugh and now you guys are doing the same thing and it hurts
So if I don't laugh when I should laugh, that's why I'm holding it back
This show has been going for over a year now, right? Yeah, I know, somehow.
So this is the anniversary episode, really?
Kind of, in a way. I mean, if anything were the way we do things, our anniversary episode
would be at like month 15. So it's kind of perfect.
So I shipped some stuff to Australia, two packages, one to West Australia, one to Wollongong.
The one to Western Australia actually got there first, which I was surprised by because
I assumed everything kind of just went into a funnel in Sydney or something and then they
just sort of put it on emus and sent them on their way and when they got there, they
got there.
But Western Australia got there first, maybe, I don't know, about a week ago?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then by the miracle of Andrew's delaying the show, the other one got there to Martin
yesterday, or today, whatever time zone thing is happening right now.
This afternoon.
This afternoon.
So.
Perfect.
There you go.
It's all planned.
When I ship things, it's with a purpose.
So do you have your packages that were instructed do not open?
Absolutely, right next to me.
Very exciting.
Okay, and I think there's two, is that correct?
Correct.
I've already forgotten like basically what was even in the damn things.
It's taken so long.
It's like a photo.
And before we open this, can I just say that I think this perfectly highlights kind of
like the difference in how we engage in keynote chat on our public Discord, the difference
in let's say enthusiasm and generosity between Americans and Australians?
Yes.
Because what did we do, Andrew?
SFI.
So thank you Jason for being such a nice person. Andrew you're good too, but you know what I mean
Yeah, well, we'll let people calculate what that stands for. Yeah, I think I've got it
But I can't say it on the on the clean show, which we still have somehow no one checks these things
I don't think by the way, I don't think anybody's actually policing this. It's no it's all fine
All we need is one Karen to start listening. I know and the fun times are finished. This said it was clean
I mean, so what do we have to do? It could be worse
So I think there's like an envelope one that says do not open and then a like a longer boxy looking one
Let's do the envelope first at the same time. We'll open it and then you tell us just go for it
Yeah, just tear into it. It's pretty self-explanatory. Let's get some
Is that is that pleasant to listen to oh, it's amazing
Okay, so this is this is a token of
the show
Beautiful we all have one mine got here far faster than yours did because I already had it a beautiful card that says
Congratulations on the whole year on one whole year of being recorded in the southern hemisphere. Thank you so much
You and what do we have in he did it? Oh, I love it
How did you know that I would froth over a light blue?
- Same.
- Second generation iPod shuffle
with the charging cable included.
- You guys got blue ones and I have an orange one,
of course, 'cause it's on brand, obviously.
(laughing)
Well, you know what, I'm gonna wear this
- Oh my goodness, that is wonderful.
- Pajama shirt, which has a hole in it
for the rest of this.
It's like a pin for being in a club
for some amount of time,
but instead it's an old crappy iPod.
- Are all our episodes on this?
- Funny story.
That was the plan, but couldn't get it to work.
[laughter]
I gave up.
I spent so much time pulling all the episodes,
getting them all renamed and everything so they'd be on there in the right order.
Oh, wow.
I had USB-C to USB-A to whatever that stupid ass little cable is
it's a USB-A to a headphone jack, since the iPod Shuffle uses the headphone jack for data.
Looking at it right here. Plug that into my 2021 M1 iMac, to which it
didn't do anything at first. And then I finally got it to show up in Finder, which by the
way, that whole thing where your phone and everything just shows up in Finder now, after
they got rid of iTunes, that just feels like that's how it should have always been.
It works so well. Yeah, it's so nice. It just pops up like a drive and it's got
all your stuff. It seems great. I mean, it's ironic that now that's there when
you quite literally never plug your phone in anymore to a computer unless
like something's gone wrong. I've been doing that to run my Mod Pod and it's
been good. Oh yeah, for sure. For the iPod, definitely. But for your phone, I mean, I
cannot remember the last time I ever had to plug in an iPhone into a computer for
any reason. I think probably jailbreaking like the iPhone 5 or something would
have been the last time. Anyway, all that said, couldn't get the damn thing to take
the episode so I'm pretty sure you have an empty iPod so do with it what you will.
I'll be walking with this this week I promise you and I'll get funny looks.
I'm backing my Intel iMac to deal with it no problem at all.
That's what I thought at first I thought maybe M1 like couldn't understand iPods or something like it just was like I don't even know
What that language is so no I'm not even gonna show you but they did eventually show up
So I don't know maybe you can get Martin will probably if anybody can get it to work Martin will get it to work
That's true. And if not, I'll just pretend that it's working. Yeah, he'll have his little his little crappy headphones plugged in walking down the street
No, no, he'll walk around with it with an iPod hi-fi on his shoulder
It's right there next to me. I'll do it
Just stuck in the top. Yeah, it has carry handles for a reason and double-a battery slots. I love it
All right box number two. That is the box. This is like so that's a wearable
Okay, what's that? It's all those wearables. That's what the kids are a toothbrush. This one is more of a
shelf
decoration
Appreciated the little waffle that you put in the box as well the little oh, yeah, the three grams. Have you eaten that yet?
I've been holding off. I'll get to it. Oh, I recognize this font. Not a sponsor.
What?
So this is a vintage old microphone for I don't remember what machine this even went to. One of
the crappy beige Macs. But it's just like I found them and was like these you have to have this.
This is well, you know, it's great. I think this is fantastic. I love the quality of the box just for our listeners
This is a we can include a picture in the show notes
This is in the old Apple Garamond font with the beautiful brown cardboard box
Microphone has been translated into multiple languages on the box
microphone microphone or microphone microphone
Yeah, it clearly says microphone over and over again is the idea that will record future episodes with this
So I had a thought that we could record an episode
Or at least part of one with these really really crap microphones. Let's do it. I found a lot of them and
bought them all
Because why not right?
It's really the box that it's great. It was great that the microphones were in pristine brand-new condition
This is one of those were like
They stuck them in a closet in some place and then someone found them and was like, why do we have this?
Let's sell them for nothing. So do you know what it looks like many years ago? I had something that was known as a
Pillow a pillow speaker or a sleep. Oh, yeah
I'm speaker and I was like a little flat thing like this and you would put it under your pillow and listen to your
Radio transistor and she fell asleep
It looked a lot like this
It also looks like it could be a medical device. I'm super happy with both of these gifts
Happy birth or happy birthday
Anniversary, I don't know whatever you got some crap
All right, we can start now the
First big task that we have is to be as brief as possible in saying
Only one thing that we found remarkable about the most recent Apple event. This is very very difficult for us
So time is of the essence.
You mean we can't do an entire rundown that takes longer than the show itself?
No one wants to hear that.
That's right.
Okay.
No.
No one cares.
We're going to recognize it and we're going to move on to the next thing.
So I reckon we go in alphabetical order.
Andrew.
Okay.
Off you go.
I bought an iPhone 13 mini.
Ooh.
But what I really want and don't need is that iPad mini.
Fair.
Totally agree.
That was amazing.
That was amazing. You actually you took the task and completed it and that was it.
Almost haiku. Wow. I'm impressed. I'm done. Am I next?
Wait, alphabetical. Oh yeah. First night.
I kind of already forgot what happened. Oh, I'll go with something stupid.
That weird like edge effect on the new Apple Watch.
For some reason, I'm very, very drawn to that.
And I don't know why, because it's not a practical feature.
But for some reason I'm super into it.
That's it.
The particular marketing shots they were using of that newer watch face.
Was it that kind of spillover that you were most interested in?
I think so.
I don't know why.
I really can't explain it.
It's not as if there could be a feature that that would take advantage of.
It's not like I can see different widgets from the side or something, but
they did a good job of selling me on something that I don't actually need.
They're two for two on selling people what we don't need.
Well, not yet.
since it's not available. I haven't technically bought it yet. We'll see. Watch yourself.
Very good. Now I'm going to continue the theme of things that we don't need and talk about the event
broadly itself. Could some of these things just have been in a press release? Did it require
a gigantic sweeping drone shot continuously across the entire state of California? Maybe not. So I
enjoyed it and I enjoyed the experience more so because of our Discord participation. But by the
the end of it I thought hmm was that an event or as I've said before was it an
infomercial okay now we're moving on to a primary teacher style review for iOS
and iPad OS 15 and what I mean by that is that Natasha has shared with me a
particular way of encouraging constructive and positive criticism oh
man you guys need that that's this should definitely be taught in
Australian schools exactly normally we just tell everyone they're wrong and
idiots yeah we're trying to improve right thank you and the way that we do
it this might be a little bit of an American approach we give two stars we
know you're big on stars but just 48 short sorry about that and then we offer
a wish not a criticism but a wish for something to improve hold on hold on
wait you give two stars meaning as in one star for something good another star
for something else that's good and then a wish for something else so it's three
things in total oh so this is not a star scale of iOS 15 is five stars this is
no it's not an uber trip Wow okay it's like we took away Alaska and Hawaii and
we gave one to each of the good things okay and by primary school you mean
elementary school right correct the thing before middle which doesn't exist
here because you just go straight to high unless you're in some weird system
or in private or something Wow okay I'm gonna go ahead and let you all go first
so that I can pretend like I know what's going on and just follow on naturally.
Cool, cool. Okay, so star number one for me is EXIF data in photos on iOS and iPadOS.
I've gone small and very particularly here just because I feel like people are talking about how the iPad is a computer.
Some people disagree. To me, this is one of those little things that just gets added where you go,
where you go, you know what,
you're getting more computery things.
I can swipe up and see what was taken,
maybe with my Canon or something else.
So it just makes it a little bit more
of a photography friendly environment.
- Yeah.
- Star number two, I actually broke the rule here
and went to watchOS.
I didn't even know I set the rule for myself
that it was iOS, but here we are.
watchOS, even more obscure than what I just said.
I'm a very heavy user of the dock from the side button,
right?
I have a complication free watch face other than the date
the simple dial. And for years it has annoyed me that even though I set favorites to be the apps
that are shown in the dock, it always shows one pesky recently used item at the top that I don't
want. For some reason they got rid of it. So now I only see the favorite apps that I've put in there
without having to navigate past one that I didn't ask for. One wish that I have is actually, let's
say for iPad OS. Widgets are cool I suppose, but every time I go to use them they somehow
disappoint me or get in the way or I find there's too much information density. I wish
for something that will never happen and that is the transformation of widgets not into
something that's on the home screen and not in something that's on one column from the
left that you have to swipe in, but a dashboard overlay that would come over the top and show
me my favorite widgets like it did about 15 years ago. No one wants that, it'll never
happen but I want that. You could have like a ripple effect as you added one to the screen.
That's exactly what I want and I want my lost widget to tell me every 108 minutes to save
the world with the code, right? That's my two stars and a wish. Okay, well my first
star. I feel like I've written this almost in merit certificate style. Good job widgets.
That's my first one. Yeah, they actually turned up, they've made an effort, they're trying
to do something useful. Whether that turns out to be the case, I'm not sure. I went a
little bit widget crazy on my iPad today, just to see if I could actually find utility.
Let me look at it real quick here. So I got random bits of widgets. I got a photo, I got
weather, I got email inbox, I've got craft documents, I've got an app store for some
reason, I've got a calendar. You know what? They're nice, but they're not setting my world
on fire. So it's good that they're there, but I'm yet to see a really, really helpful
widget. Maybe I've got drafts. If I swipe over, I've got drafts on the swipey bit. That
might be quite good. And I can know what time it is in Portland. It's 5.43 AM in Portland.
Sorry, Jason. So that's my first star of widgets. It's a start. Second star, text recognition.
I'm sure I'll find a use eventually.
That seems to be the big tent pole feature.
The fact that you can recognize any text from any photo.
- I believe you're speaking of live text.
- Thank you.
Thank you, live text.
I'm sure I'll find a use eventually.
- Do you know what I tested it on just quickly?
I took a photo of my iPod
and it managed to grab the text on the screen
and put it in the appropriate formatted list.
I was very impressed.
- The feature is insane.
- I think it's technically amazing.
But what do I do?
When do I?
I'm trying to think when I've ever needed something like that.
So I need to discover a reason for having it now.
I reckon there are so many people out there who love doing handwritten lists
or texts of things, right?
Because they like the process of handwriting or putting down their thoughts that way.
But then it's like, oh, what I do this piece of paper.
So I can imagine it would actually be useful for digitizing things
that people prefer to handwrite and then go away with it.
Yeah. So I don't know if that applies to you.
The one thing that comes to mind for me is the thing yet again that we're not doing right
now but flashback two years ago, three years ago, however long it's been, and you'd go
to conferences for work events or whatever.
You'd sit in on different sessions and people would be doing slide decks.
They never give you the slide decks ever.
They just don't.
So you're sitting there and everybody's taking photos of the stupid slides to make sure that
you're capturing that.
This is more a work thing, I think.
If you went to a fun event, you probably wouldn't care.
But for work crap, you're listening to different things
and you're taking photos of slides.
Now you take that, and now I'm just
copying and pasting that out instead of sitting there
trying to transcribe from a crap off-angle photo of a crap
projector.
So that would have been game changer several years ago.
So I'm sure sometime in the future
that'll be a thing again.
But I, that was, that's one thing that always came to mind of what a pain to take a
picture of a screen and then have to go back and look at those pictures
and hand type them back to notes. Like so dumb.
So well, Federighi did a similar thing with the whiteboard in the demo.
So I think you're a, Oh yeah. Whiteboard too. Yeah.
You're in a meeting or something. You just take a quick picture, which I mean,
we've all taken pictures of the whiteboard forever,
But now it's just that extra step of now you have it as actual text so you can search it.
Whereas I'm the OCD guy that never likes to take photos of anything like that because they're not genuine photos and they don't belong in the photo album.
They should never be in the photo album.
Oh boy.
So I'm going to find a different app that I can use for utilitarian photos.
That sounds like you.
Anyway, my wish is that I could use the power that my M1 iPad has in a meaningful way.
Because they're still, still not moving the needle on that.
I'm still using a 2018 iPad pro and like it works.
I don't, it's fine. I don't know anything that it doesn't do. I mean,
I do. I want an M one iPad. Of course I do. Cause it's an M one iPad,
but until it does something, even if it's something like, Oh,
it only this iPad can run. I mean, I don't really think,
I don't want it to run Mac iOS apps. I think that's not a good way to go,
But let's say there was some, I don't know, make up a thing, catalyst something
or other that, oh, these kind of apps can run on anything that's M1.
Okay.
Then I would probably consider upgrading, but there's nothing where I'm like, oh
my gosh, this is so slow or it doesn't load or there's just nothing that that
iPad can't do and it's ridiculous that it's lasted that long.
You're right.
You're right.
Software used to pull hardware.
Sales, you know, like software.
It'd be too you'd try and run this piece of where it would be cruddy. So you go
I've got a buy a new computer now that doesn't happen anymore. Does it? No
I mean, it's like the Mac the Mac Pro right the big the big giant metal box that they have now
There's nothing I need it for I it I quite literally wouldn't need any of that power considering I have this
relatively compared to that cheap iMac that is ridiculous it just goes and goes and goes and
and that's it. It's bizarre that they're able to last this long.
It's funny that it flies in the face so much of the like,
"Oh, the Macs are so expensive and they don't last very long."
It's like, this iPad probably will go another five years from now and still be fine.
But okay, tell me more about your Chromebook.
Natasha is still using her MacBook Pro from 2014 and is still doubtful as to
whether she wants to replace it. Yeah. And she does serious work on it. Yeah, it's crazy.
She does. They really do last a long time. If it wasn't the fact that I'm just an
idiot and I have to buy new crap all the time, a lot of this stuff would just be
completely fine for a really long time. Especially this M stuff. This iMac I feel
like is gonna be handed down quite a few times over the course of its life
Because it's just that good. News flash, real-time update, Natasha heard me from
the other room and has sent me an iMessage saying I'm on it right now. See?
So we can confirm the MacBook Pro from 2014 is still running. Look at that, live
follow-up from the audience. I love it. So Jason, do you have your
two stars and a wish? Oh yeah, I've been stalling because I don't actually
have any, so I've been trying to think of them in the background while you guys
were going. So you may have seen me frantically scrolling on my phone
and trying to figure out what I liked about it.
So star number one is, combo star, haha,
Safari plus extensions.
- Okay.
- Kind of one star.
I'm lumping them together.
I think that's something that I think has been needed
for a while to have more parity between the platforms.
So like having a one password extension
in the browser on the iPad, that's frigging sweet.
love that. So that would be my first star. And I still love the new Safari. Whatever.
Not even going to get into it, but I think it's great. The second one would be weather.
I know. Super exciting. Weather app. No one talks about weather apps ever. The new stock
weather app. It's really cool. I don't know how much of this is because of the dark sky
stuff that happened however many years ago, but the new one I'm finding to be very nice.
It seems very accurate for where I am.
It's got push notifications, way more data when you actually go into a location.
So the new weather app, great.
I see zero reason to have any other weather app.
So that's my second star.
And then what am I supposed to do?
Oh, wish.
I think my wish would be these screens, how they work for the last 20 years.
I just would like something different.
I don't know what that something different is, but just this squares aligned to top left
on pages.
I mean, we have widgets now.
Cool.
I think the widgets are like 25% of what they need to be,
as far as being content,
because right now they're kind of,
I think of them more as shortcuts than actual applications.
And they're new, they need some time to bake,
but I don't really feel like they do anything.
Much like how the clock app is the only thing
that technically moves on the screen when you're not in it,
There's gotta be more stuff than just that.
Like a widget should be able to be doing things
while I'm just looking at it.
There's no reason at this point.
With these fricking phones being as beefed up as they are
and now we've got 120 hertz,
so we can do variable refresh rate.
I just feel like more action needs to be happening
without me having to do anything.
'Cause I feel like that's a big part of these devices.
They're supposed to be thinking one step ahead
and doing stuff for you.
It's like that's great, but if I still have to go into it to get that result who cares
Media corner now yes, I'm going to intro this we have actually this is off the back of a
One Prime Plus member topic suggestion.
David, who was acknowledged recently for joining, thank you very much David.
He was asking us, "Is there a movie that we love or enjoy that our spouses cannot stand
and think that we're idiots for liking it?"
So I thought, you know what, this is actually a Media Corner discussion, so we're going
to let David take over Media Corner today with his One Prime Plus member benefit.
And I thought that we could each offer a movie that our spouses dislike or think that we're
idiots for enjoying.
Media Prime Plus.
Exactly.
So do one of you two want to go first?
I'll go.
Oh boy, this could not have been a more timely question, honestly.
Well, nah, he could have asked this at any point and this would have been the same answer.
is such a film that exists in the world where one member of my household
absolutely thinks it is the worst movie ever made and this is the benchmark
movie for when we watch anything that is not good I check and see is it better or
worse than insert name of film okay Wow so this comes up a bit oh this is like a
running meme in our household for many many years. I think we probably saw this
again not good with time but this is was it at least five years or more ago I
would imagine. I should have asked her because she probably has like the date
burned into her head of like the worst day of her life. Anyway the movie hailing
from the year 1935 so you know it's good already. Transatlantic Tunnel! I can hear
everyone like just "yeah yeah transatlantic tunnel!" They're just cheering at their iPod
hi-fives right now. I am. So it's a it's a again a movie from 1935 okay and the
cover I definitely go look at the show notes cuz like the cover for this is
like what is even happening with that I couldn't tell you this film is I think
it's pretty good I wouldn't say it's like the best movie ever this isn't like
a I think it's the best movie ever and she thinks it's the worst movie ever she
just thinks that it's something she would rather do anything else in the
world than ever have to watch again and the best part is that I have it in Plex
obviously. So every time Plex comes up for some reason it's one of the like
recently added movies to the queue. It's like always on the screen every time we
bring up Plex so that's always fun. But it's a it's a movie about making the
transatlantic tunnel which is a tunnel that goes across the Atlantic and that's
basically the whole movie. It's like a documentary but not because it didn't
happen and it's fairly unremarkable as a film but it's become such a staple of
our household in that it's its own rating system right so instead of
saying is a movie two stars five stars whatever it's just better or worse than
the transatlantic tunnel. So far to date I think we've only had one film that in recent memory
that I convinced I would say convinced her that it was worse. So I think it's maybe not the worst
now it's like second worst. Can you sum up for me very explicitly what you like about this film?
I have a thing for watching old crap for some reason I'm not really sure why I think I probably
a really really old person trapped in a younger person's body, I think.
Matthew: Yeah, I've allied to that. Yeah.
Ben: And so I watch, I mean a number of things. So I think we talked about like Twilight Zone and
Alfred Hitchcock and a lot of the old black and white era television. A lot of radio dramas. I
like those a lot. Like Dragnet is something that I have been obsessed with for many many many years
and I watch constantly on loop probably until I die.
I've probably seen every episode a million times.
So this falls into that where I like those,
you've probably seen them on like the Apple TV
or just in apps in general.
There's like those really, really crap apps
that are called like classics with an X
and it's like all the like really, really crappy versions
of like public domain just junk.
Things that people would never pay for.
I love those apps. So I will just go in and pick whatever random piece of trash
that's in there that day and watch it and I think that's how this movie
happened. I think we saw it initially on a service called Voodoo. I don't remember
I don't know if you guys ever had that in Australia. It's really old. I think
actually it's still around but it used to be a service way back before like
Netflix and all that kind of stuff was a thing and you actually got a physical
box like a like a set-top box from them that would connect up to their whatever
and that's how you watched all your stuff it was actually pretty cool I
think it was kind of ahead of its time for what it was but I think they had a
lot of old crap on there and that's where I first saw this movie I believe
that sounds a bit like the real play boxes that you can get here that you
know like for example if you have different languages your mother tongue
they will load all this Greek or Italian content oh yeah yeah this was like a
- It's like a dedicated box for that stuff.
- Yeah, this was like Apple TVs before that was a thing,
but it only was for that one specific service
and that's all it did.
And yeah, I think it was, maybe it was 720p.
So I think that was their thing was it was like
high definition, quote unquote, but yeah,
Transatlantic Tunnel, I think everyone should go watch it.
Really, I mean, if it's the second worst,
that's a pretty good review, I think.
- I have to check it out.
- Right?
I did not expect that. That's a great answer. Everyone watch the trains at the ending tunnel.
Please do. Please do. And let me know how great you think it is. I want to watch it
again. I just, you know, I obviously have to watch it by myself. So we'll see how that
goes. What do you got Martin?
This was actually a pretty recent viewing that I want to bring up. And it's not something
that Natasha hated, but she really found disappointing and underwhelming. And that movie was a movie
that she had not seen before and it was Ghostbusters.
Which one?
The first one?
The first one, yep.
Now I've long enjoyed this film.
Most people are familiar with what Ghostbusters is all about.
1980s classic comedy, deadpan humor, Bill Murray, etc.
You know, Dan Aykroyd.
I've always enjoyed this film.
Obviously the song goes along with it and I said to Natasha, "Look, I don't know if
you're going to like it or not, but I think it's something that you should have in your
pop culture lexicon or vernacular or general awareness."
Right?
Yeah.
and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it again
and at the end of it she said "that wasn't funny"
and I went "hmm, interesting"
and she said "it just wasn't as funny as I thought it would be"
and then I took a step back
and it really kind of hit me just how much
nostalgia or pop culture influence
or how much you've seen something over the course of your life
can really influence what you think of it
because I'm a long time Bill Murray fan
I like films like Stripes, Groundhog Day
other things with Dan Aykroyd in it like Coneheads
There's this kind of overly verbose deadpan humour or just the way that they approach
the acting that I enjoy.
But it occurred to me that for someone like Natasha who has heard the Ghostbusters theme
that many times on the radio and had this thing hyped up as some hilarious comedy, if
you're not familiar with that kind of deadpan or verbose humour, at least from the States,
you're going to be disappointed.
So it really put a different lens on the film for me, but it hasn't affected my own enjoyment.
I'm with her on that.
Yeah, it's a rubbish movie.
And most 80s movies that are comedies are not funny.
Very few hold up.
But yeah.
I'm going to regret asking this, but has she seen Back to the Future?
Yes.
And?
She enjoys that.
We actually went to see it live with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.
Very enjoyable.
Careful with your answer, Andrew.
No, that one's okay.
That one holds up.
That's a good movie.
It's very, very well written.
But Ghostbusters is trash.
No to Ghostbusters.
Wow, that is, that's...
She didn't say it was horrible.
I think it was just the fact that you hear this really upbeat song with all the 80s synth
and carry on and you expect that it's going to be like really laugh out loud funny.
But a lot of the stuff that you watch from Bill Murray, for example, his style is that
he is kind of always, at least I've interpreted it this way, that he's always kind of detached
from the plot that he's in.
He's always kind of not funny.
Yeah, he's sniping at, no Andrew it is funny.
He's sniping at the thing that he's in, kind of breaking the fourth wall in his own way.
Has she seen the transatlantic tunnel?
Well that's gonna be next on our list now and we'll tell you whether she liked that
more or less than Ghostbusters.
That might reset her expectations.
I mean they use a radium drill.
What more do you need from a film than a radium drill?
Nothing.
It's pretty cool.
That could be its own character.
It should have just been in the credits.
Radium drill played by themself.
Get that at your local Bunnings.
Easily.
Do they have people sitting inside the radium drill?
Is it like one of those sort of...
- Whoa, no spoilers.
No spoilers for the transatlantic tunnel.
- I'm just thinking about the sort of drills
I used to draw as a primary school kid.
It would tunnel its way through the earth.
- Oh, like from Ninja Turtles.
They'd jump in those drill machines
and they'd drill through the earth
and come out at like angles that made no sense.
- Yes, I used to draw those all the time.
- Yeah.
- I just got the drill from the Matrix Revolutions
in my head.
That was kind of terrible.
- Oh man, talk about disappointing.
No, go ahead, Andrew.
All right.
Well, I've given, I gave the 80s movies a hard time.
You can give me a hard time.
Cause I'm not going to do this challenge properly.
I couldn't think of anything.
And so I went to Hannah and I said, what's a movie that I like that you hate?
And she listed like 50.
She couldn't really think of any either.
And so I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to answer this wrong, but I'm going to call a movie
that most that we both like that most people would think is garbage.
Oh, interesting twist.
Okay.
Okay.
And I can't take credit for thinking of this, but I totally agree.
Ghostbusters 2.
It was Hannah.
Dude, where's my car?
Oh, wow.
That's like, I remember that.
The movie with Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott.
Yeah.
I have to admit at this stage that I've never watched it.
I should.
Oh, that feels like something you definitely would have seen.
We went through a period where we would watch this a couple of times a week.
We basically knew the entire script off by heart.
Wow.
What do you enjoy about it?
It's just this absurdity.
It has been a while since I've watched it.
I'm due for a rewatch.
But it's just funny, it's dumb, it doesn't take itself seriously.
It's a relaxing way to spend 90 minutes.
Just stupid stuff happening in front of you that you can laugh at.
It has been a while since I've watched it, so I'm struggling to go much beyond that.
I am going to have to do a rewatch.
I'm gonna have to watch both of yours because I haven't seen them
I know about dude, where's my car but never actually sat down and then we can compare that to the transatlantic tunnel
We went it was in the period where we were watching is basically. Um, it was dude. Where's my car office space and go?
We're like the three movies that were we would watch on repeat a lot and because it was we had them on DVD and this
Was early DVD days when the library was limited office space
I can still like just say every line before it happens. It's actually in my Apple TV Q to rewatch
I added it from because I think it's in star on Disney Plus
I was like, oh, I'm gonna watch that again that maybe sort of steered my career the way I managed my career for a few years
Yeah, well the fact that it is quite literally timeless is amazing. Yep. Yeah
Much like the other one he did that tells the future
Idiocracy which was like how the hell did he what crystal ball and like what devil did he sell his soul to because wow that was
Completely accurate. I've seen that come up a few times in Twitter since actually people have brought up that movie
Idiocracy saying hmm. Yeah, but office space is like wow. How did it know?
What my life was going to be it's at a certain point and it's just wow
Well, you know what Jason you've got upper management potential written all over you
I know they made a movie about me before I even knew that it was gonna be it's crazy
short of taking a
Handle off of a door with a drill because everything's key cards now
It's basically my life. Damn. It feels good to be a gangster. I don't have dude. Where's my car in?
I'm looking in plex. I don't have that in plex. So I cannot I think I still have a DVD in the attic
I was gonna start watching it right now, but I don't have it. So I'll just continue talking to you guys
And look just a little plug here for people listening if you aren't already a one prime plus subscriber
We've just actually meandered into talking to our own careers, which is actually this month's special members episode
So if you want to hear more about
What the hell we do and how boring it might actually be or how inspiring it might be because I know Andrew's really into
Spreadsheets that clearly office space inspired him. You should tune in to one prime plus and get that private RSS feed
And also dude, where's my car doesn't work anymore because Apple Maps just shows me where my car is. So oh
Yeah, I always say real quick and it never is it's never it's never quick
I know I like to like I like to give people the like illusion that oh, okay
This is gonna be a quick segment and then they're like, why is he still talking about teams for 45 minutes?
I have the pleasure of rediscovering that as I'm editing. Yeah
He gets all excited. He's like, oh good. This is good. No. No, that's a lot of waveform
so I said a
Realization about things and when I say things I mean the task app thingy called things
Anyway, it's not really about things. It's more about completing stuff in general
So if you've used things or not
The way things works is it has a today view which gives you one of my favorite things ever
It gives you your calendar at the top of what's coming up and they gray out as you're done,
which is great.
So as you look at it through the day, you kind of get a nice little boom.
Here's like what's coming up.
And then all your stuff that is marked today.
And to me, for whatever reason, today means like whatever's in the today view has to be
done today.
For whatever reason I had a, one of those like, wandering the desert, eating mushrooms
kind of epiphanies that, wait a second, just because it's on today doesn't necessarily
mean that it has to be added to today and then removed from today all within the same
24 hour period.
Today really means this is something I need to be working on today.
No task usually is a boom, it's just done.
A lot of stuff takes you days, weeks, months to work on.
So this may be old news to everyone in the world, but I am now doing today view as here's
all the stuff that I'm going to be working on today and I'm not going to be stressed
so that I have to get that list down to zero.
Rather, it's gonna be, here's what I'm working on today.
Today is also tomorrow and the next day.
And everything can have deadlines
for when they actually need to be quote done, right?
So now I have a today view, bunch of crap in there.
But to the right, it says one day left.
Or today, like it actually is due today.
Or 613 days left.
But I still wanna work on that today
and I can move things in and out of today
on the off chance that somebody has been
driving themselves nuts with stuff like this of,
oh, it's on today, I gotta get it done today.
If it's not done today, I gotta move it to tomorrow.
And it's like, no, just leave it in today and go with it.
- After hearing you say the word today so many times,
I am simultaneously sold on your message
and think that you communicated it very well,
but also I feel like that word has lost all meaning to me.
You know when you say a word so many times
that it just becomes a sound?
I'll give you a word to replace it.
5G.
5G.
Jesse, you need 5G.
Skit pow.
No.
