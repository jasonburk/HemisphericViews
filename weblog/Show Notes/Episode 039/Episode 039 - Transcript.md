Hello I'm David Beasley-Kenyon. I live in Perth, WA. I'm gonna tell people about
myself and I'm a nerdy kid like my father and I love computers like him.
Oh man, I'm not used to this um, so I'm very
nervous to do this podcast and
I love gaming -
Finally someone here that will actually talk to me. These other two will never talk to me about games
They just I go on and then they just they leave the room while I talk about it and then they come back later
That's how it usually works
You could be Jason's new best friend, I think
And don't be don't be nervous at all. You've done a great job in throwing yourself and you are also very brief
You kept it short, which we can never do. So that's amazing. I
Can't wait to give star ratings to the AC DC crew on who did a better job during this episode
I'm thinking it's not gonna be me
Three minutes 15 seconds in and we're already well weighted to one side
I'm not gonna say which but I'll leave I'll leave you all to figure that out
So Jason over the last a couple of weeks couple episodes ago. We talked about a show
That you are a big fan of yes detective Conan. Yes
David and I have started to watch said show we're not a long way through it. I think of the
1145 episodes or whatever there are we down with her about eight or nine of them by now
I think maybe a maybe a couple more than that
But yeah, it's it's pretty difficult to say you're anywhere near
Anything with that series because we've watched it all the time and I think we're on
Season six maybe and you have all I think there's 30 at 30 30 episodes if only 30 seasons
Plus there's a bunch of like full-length movies and then there's crossovers with other shows where they kind of intertwine a little bit
so
Wow, we were wondering about movies. So that's good news because we were talking about that just last night. I think yeah, we were I
Can I can I can help with that?
That's that's good to know
So what we've got David on here cuz he's really keen to talk about this show his thoughts and I thought we we all thought
it'd be a good idea to get him on because
were a certain demographic,
but I think David probably represents
a different demographic,
being a child born after the production of this series.
- I have a question.
- Yes.
- What does demographic mean?
- That's a good question.
This is one for Martin.
- Okay, so I'll take over that
'cause I'm the dictionary guy.
Demographic, when your dad says that,
good question by the way,
he's talking about a particular group of people.
So maybe a certain age or maybe their gender
or where they live.
So he's saying that we're a bunch of older white guys,
but you're younger and you're cooler.
So that's what he's saying essentially.
- To be clear, your father is the oldest though.
- Sadly, this is true.
- Sadly, no one voted for him.
- Jeez.
(laughing)
- This is the roast Andrew episode.
- Gotta have him on more often.
- Wow.
Yeah, so Conan, David,
what have you thought of Detective Conan so far?
- I thought it was a really good show.
lately and so the thing about it, I really want this to change.
They could add a bit more improvement for the dubbing and stuff to change different
languages to see if other people are better at it than just, yeah, to see like it's just
like a work in progress basically for me, which feels like that.
And I really want those things to change and apart from that I really love the show.
Being into the future of watching them I can tell you that they do get better.
One of the things to be, I don't know people may or may not know this, but shows like this
generally when they are subbed they're done by fan groups.
So none of this has anything to do with the people that actually made the show or created
the show or anything to do with the show itself.
There's groups of people online that are just super mega fans of these things.
So they'll take the actual show itself and they'll actually go through and create
these subtitles for each episode and then release them
in completely legitimate ways on the Internet.
Then people like me download them.
So that's why you may see somewhat of a variation in
the subbing on the various ones.
This was back in 1996.
So definitely, things ramp up in quality both from
a animation standpoint as well as other aspects of it.
But I have two questions for you.
>> There it is. We'd be
disappointed if you had any more or any less.
>> Is this a show?
Have you been into any other shows like this previously?
in terms of whether they be anime or otherwise?
- I've been into this show or manga, I should say,
like a book called My Hero Academia,
who I think it was made in Japan, but it's English.
So you read the book backwards,
which you're not really used to doing.
So I have to do like this, then flip it like backwards.
- Right, yeah.
Very cool.
And you watched Naruto for a while, didn't you?
Yeah, Naruto.
Say that again?
Yeah, Naruto.
Oh, okay.
My bad.
Step it up.
That was kind of along the same lines, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
But this is the first one I've experienced.
And it's got a kickin' song.
The song on it is super weird when you see it translated into English.
Yeah, and the song, the intro songs and the outro songs change as they go along.
So after, say, 10 episodes, there'll be a new intro song, and then after 14, there'll
be a new outro.
And they continually change as the series goes on.
Cool.
And we've now...
David, can you also just talk about the different characters just quickly, because I love your
pronunciation.
Can you just run us through the two or three main characters that we're enjoying so far?
John, the bad detective guy, which I forgot his name.
And Conan-kun.
- Yep, bad detective man.
That's basically almost word for word
what I call him as well.
- And what's Conan-kun's name when he's older?
- Shinichi.
- Thank you.
- Okay, now I have question two, which I've now forgotten.
Oh, along the lines of what we were just talking about,
actually what is your there's going to be many more characters added as it goes
on so there's only really a handful at this point but who is your favorite so
far
probably the bad detective guy because he's funny
I can fully respect that that is a excellent answer
see where's my favorite is the this he has a little group of kids that he's
become friends with because they don't have to be a kid
- Yeah, the detective boys, exactly.
And although there's a girl in the detective boys,
so I haven't quite figured that out.
- But she's so into it, she doesn't even care.
She's just like, yeah, we're the detective boys.
It's like, all right, do what you're gonna do.
- So my favorite is the detective boy
that actually looks like he's about a detective teenager.
- Oh, Genta.
- The big guy that seems to eat a lot
and a bit of the comic relief.
- Yes.
Yeah, he is a classic.
- How he is the same age as the other boys,
I haven't quite figured out.
That's one of those things we just look over and say, "Okay."
Much like how a teenager drank a potion and turned into a child, we're just going to let
it go.
I'm on board with that.
Don't worry.
I have no issue with that.
That little plot device.
I am super stoked that you got onto this and are enjoying it.
really fun. This was able to traverse over from north to south. And yeah, that's just,
that's awesome. I look forward to hearing as it progresses for you.
Listeners, if they have kids and they want to get a chance, if they get an opportunity
to see this show, it's really good for kids and parents to watch together as well.
I just want to include Martin for a second to add a question.
Thanks David.
much David. Yes I have a question for you David. Look your dad's a podcaster now
you're on the podcast I think that's awesome but I want to know what do you
think or what does the family think about your dad being a podcaster because
I know that when I talk to my family and friends they say oh that's kind of cool
like you're doing stuff and talking about what interests you but you're also
a bit of a dork Martin you're a bit of a nerd what do you think about your dad?
He's a bit like me.
And mum is kind of okay with it.
She says she likes the podcast and dad's friends, Martin and Jason.
And that's basically all I can say.
I didn't have that much time to look into it.
So, David, I just want to say your mother was on here one time and I don't want to expose
her or anything, but she really enjoyed being on the podcast. So I just want to say don't
let her fool you into thinking that she's not super into the podcast, because she is.
I have two follow up questions quickly. Number one, what is your favorite game you're playing
right now? Because neither of these two will talk to me about video games. And yeah, let's
start there.
My favourite one is probably Roblox and Assassin's Creed.
I think they're very good games because on Roblox it's a platform where there's other
games on it that you can play with creators and stuff.
And it's a nice experience.
and Assassin's Creed. It's very good how they got the graphics, made it into kind of like
an RPG kind of thing. And they just designed the game very well and got the voice acting
good very well and made it into like a real world that you're working in.
So would Assassin's Creed game in the style of Roblox be the most awesome thing ever or
Roblox is a bit like blocking and stuff.
Yeah, Roblox.
I think you've heard of this platform before, Roblox.
And I think Roblox is a bit better than Assassin's Creed.
That's my personal opinion.
Whoa, bombshell.
This is where you come for the bombshells, hemispheric views.
And that was a big one. Take that, GameSpot.
You guys don't even have GameSpot.
That did not land at all.
[laughter]
Damn it.
All right.
Second question, and probably my final question, but I've been known to say that before.
If you were going to start your very own internet podcast with friends, school, fam, whatever,
anybody, pick whoever you want to do it, or by yourself, that works too.
What would it be about?
About gaming, definitely.
And like I would bring Seb Sebastian into my podcast.
I don't know if you know about him or not.
- I do not know, no.
Who's that?
- And it's a friend that lives in Bridgetown
and he's a very nice one.
And maybe one more, which is Anton in our school.
He's very nice to me.
And yeah, that's basically all I need.
What would you talk about gaming?
I don't miss that.
Yeah, sorry.
What would the title be?
Do you have a title already picked out?
I bet you do.
Probably the.
The boredom busters.
Excellent name.
Wow.
Well, I'm not even a huge gamer, but I would listen to that.
I would listen to that.
Now you just need to find somebody that's close to you that has the equipment necessary to record a podcast and then you're set.
Yeah.
Thank you, David.
Appreciate the feedback.
I hope you continue enjoying Detective Conan.
Thank you.

An announced typing tournament.
All right, here we go.
So I've sent you both a message which includes a link to a free typing test inspired by Natasha
because she's challenged me to this before and there's been no practice here and I haven't
warned either of these guys that I'm going to do this, being Jason and Andrew because
David's left.
we're going to do a bit of a touch typing challenge in a one minute free test. Okay,
so you're going to open up the link in your browser, and you should see your own generated
text. Let me let me know when you've seen that. So what's going to happen is we're going to start
roughly the same time, what we're going to do, we're going to type for a minute, we're going to
get to the end, and then we're going to share the typing speed and accuracy that we received. It's
one time only any of us could stuff up. And we're going to share the screenshot of what we've done
done in the show notes, but we're also going to screen record with QuickTime or whatever
other tool we want, and we're going to add it to the YouTube channel so the listeners
can see it. All right, so now just to make sure we've all got a different text because
it auto generates on this site, we're going to say the first three words that pop up.
So mine starts off with the more uncomfortable. Andrew, the sport of and Jason when you're
on. Okay, perfect. So when I say go, we're all going to start it doesn't matter if we
don't finish at the same time because it is all time to a minute for each of us and then
we're going to share our results.
Okay.
Three, two, one, go.
It's not telling you where your cursor is.
Is it meant to be?
It's not working.
Hang on.
Window wasn't active.
Meanwhile, Martin is just like all just so hardcore.
It makes a typing noise.
It does?
I mean, my computer...
What the f- So do you get like docked points?
Oops, I'm stuffing up myself now.
It's hard when you've got people on the phone.
What if my strategy is to just talk...
Oh man, shut up Jason!
It's very distracting, I'm doing worse.
that will work in my benefit. Oh, oh, everything went away.
All right, so we'll have a result.
Oh, I've not typed like that in a while. That was typing from copying is different from typing from your brain.
Well, I can tell you very honestly that I did not practice this. I've only done it the once with Natasha, and it was way harder.
I think people talk at the same time.
We'll see if you're right.
So I can tell you that, and I'll just get in there quickly.
I did worse than the first time that I did this.
Good, that was Jason's fault.
So my...
You didn't say there was a rule where people couldn't talk.
No, no, no, it's good.
It's good because that's, it's a podcast.
That's the whole idea.
So my speed was 78 words per minute with 95% accuracy.
I almost just spit soju all over my screen.
(laughing)
What were those numbers again?
- Oh yeah, sorry, 78 words per minute, 95% accuracy.
- If I was match fit, I would have taken you.
I like to think that, you know,
but you thrust this on me with no training time,
no warmups.
I went for 58 words per minute at 95% accuracy.
I'm gonna print, I wanna print my certificate.
Oh my gosh. Wow. All right. I will preface this with, I don't know the alphabet.
It's that Dvorak keyboard you're using.
It's the Dvorak and it doesn't have letters on it. You know, the like blank key caps.
It's that one. That gets you every time. And it's split.
And one is at a 45 degree angle the opposite way of the other.
It's ergonomic. 39 words per minute.
98% accuracy.
You're very accurate.
Slow and terrible.
Well, I thought that was a lot of fun, and we all had the pressure on.
So here's what we're going to do from here on.
The three of us can go away and do this properly separately if we want, without the pressure
of me throwing it on and, you know, yelling at each other.
But on top - could be worse - but what we're going to do, we're going to upload the screen
recordings to YouTube, share the screenshots and the show notes, but I would also love
listeners to go to the show notes and take the link that we're going to include there
to this particular one minute test and share a screenshot of their own results in the Hemispheric
Views Discord @hemisphericpod on Twitter or send it to us on micro.blog@hemisphericviews as well
and show us how well you typed or how poorly you typed and we'll all have a bit of fun.
It's only a minute. Yeah, it's only a minute. It's a minute and whoever has the best combined
words per minute and accuracy wins a prize. So there.
Mavis Bacon teaches typing.
Have you heard of Patreon?
That sounds familiar.
It's new. It's very new. It's a new thing where you go throw a couple bucks in someone's
till and you get like cool stuff. And this is October now. I'm not sure if you're aware.
October has started. Therefore, October 16th is
Hemispheric Views live watch for all patrons. Oh, oh, yeah
I know. Big deal. Who does that? Does anyone else doing a live watch of what?
Crocodile Dundee! Oh
Crikey. Exactly. Now that's a movie. We're gonna watch it live with everyone else
while we
Give our opinions slash commentary over the film
Probably more commentary than films. I really think no one's showing up to just watch
Crocodile Dundee, but if you're a patron already, and if you're not sign up now tomorrow the next day up until
October 16th
one prime plus dot com it's the only URL you should ever need it should be in your
Favorites bar it should be your only bookmark. It should be your home page
You should print it out and hang it on your wall in a frame
You should rent a airplane with one of those banners behind it that says one prime plus calm
Fly it around your city
These are just some of the things people are doing already
Not to mention like if you haven't signed up yet
You're missing out on the monthly newsletter the monthly single topic show where we do as they say in the corporate world
Deep dive into one particular matter synergy we rescue
uh, like behind the scenes and extra topic stuff in our HRE minis from the vault.
Yeah, the benefits are truly endless other than when they end. But for everyone that's already
a patron, thank you so much. Cause that's just like the coolest thing ever to be able to see
people that care at all about anything we do. So thank you to all of our lovely patrons at
all levels, especially at the, um, highest level. Just saying, if you want to be, you know, maybe
just a little bit cooler than the rest. There's a way to do that.
Do you know your neighbours? And I bring this up because, I'll dive into this, because really
I think we know people across the world better than the people who live next door or above
or below us. This being a prime example, right? A one prime plus example, if you will. There
you go. And it comes to mind because quite often, like, we know neighbours and what they
look like where we live here in Wollongong, but we don't actually know who they are. And
we've actually started to come up with personas or different things to represent who they
are rather than actually knowing who they are, because our lives don't sync and we never
get to meet them. Prime example being next door. There are people we have nicknamed Tim
and Tamina because the guy looks like Tim Cook, and she kind of looks like a lady Tim
Cook as well. And I'm not making fun of who they are, but it's like, wow, they both have
these really, you know, they dress really sensibly and they look like really nice people
like they would do the prayer hands on stage at a keynote.
Is your Tim super ripped now?
I think so, yeah.
He's been working out in lockdown, yeah.
And I don't say this to make fun of them, they just look like really nice people who
kind of resemble Tim Cook, but we don't actually know who they are.
So you two, maybe starting with Jason in this case, are there any people who live around
you or you've lived nearby before and you knew really well or you came up with a different
story for them?
Anything like that?
So interesting.
So we just moved fairly recently and in the middle of a pandemic.
So in terms of where we live now, although we've lived here for a year, I would say we
know of the people that live around us.
I have, excuse me, I made a map of all of the houses in the neighborhood with all of,
and I fill in their names, children's names, pets' names, etc. on this map so that when
I am going down the street and I see one of them, I can quickly pull out my phone, tap
a button, and so I can see my map and say, "Oh, that's Joanne.
Awesome.
All right."
Because as we've already covered, my memory is less than a goldfish.
So I need that regard, whether I like these people or not, I just doesn't stick for whatever
reason.
So we sort of kind of know people.
But again, like, when we first moved in, the last thing we were going to do is just go
walking around knocking on doors like, hey, we live here now.
Here's COVID.
We know of the people we know, we know their names, we haven't really done much in the
way of interacting or anything.
There's no block gatherings or anything just by the nature of the world right now.
So I think it'll be much better whenever this is all into some kind of, "Oh, it's going to be
4th of July barbecue. Everybody's going to congregate and hang out and stuff or whatever."
But that's just not happening. So there's not really been much in the way of
knowing our neighbors, I would say.
It's a fantastic question to ask perfectly timed because we just had the return of our beloved neighbor who's been renting out his house for the last year.
This week he has moved back in and Jacob we like we love him he's the nicest young man.
I sound like such an old person saying that he's the nicest young man I say yes parties as a gentleman finish at a reasonable time.
You think 45 cucumber sandwiches I do declare where did he go to have a girl them on where he was where he was at for a year.
Yeah well he's still quite young and he actually moved back home for a year I think it was basically you can make more money renting out his house and living with mom then.
Then having your own house we got a bit of a kickstart with the mortgage payments I think but he is so such a great guy he was already out there you know week back and he's already.
gone out and fix all this front sprinklers and done handyman work on my meanwhile my broken sprinklers still out there looking broken for about six months I know I said to him I said can I subcontract you out he's so nice to be said yeah I can give you a you know I'll give you a head.
Jacob you're too nice.
Man what do you think Jacob saying about you on his podcast probably saying he's crazy is crazy old people comes up to me say to install sprinklers for him like what is this guy.
I know but so we also recently got a swimming pool installed in our backyard and we've gone to the point where we said Jacob if you ever want to swim just jump the fence just come on in you know where I can't I can't trust you.
Like what a legend.
Do you have a bit of a home improvement Wilson thing going on?
Like he's either Wilson or you're Wilson, peering over the fence.
- Oh my God, where has this gone?
Where did we just, what happened?
- Yeah, although I see his whole head.
- Well, that works.
One of you is quoting Confucius.
- I like him a lot.
In terms of other neighbors on our other side, we have actually three units.
I know the middle unit people I've met, they're like an elderly couple, even older than me,
and they speak a different language.
Sometimes when I'm hanging the laundry outside, I just hear them yelling at each other in
this really European language that sounds brilliant.
I don't know if they're angry with each other or they're just emotive, or deaf, probably
a bit of all three.
They're yelling at each other, but it sounds fantastic.
They always have cooked breakfasts, and I just want to sometimes go over there and hang
Maybe you and Jacob could go over there sometime.
A couple of houses down we've got a family who their kids go to the same school as our kids and we see them a bit, not hugely close, but enough that the kids know each other and will occasionally hang out.
Nothing too intense.
Know the people across the road.
They've just recently had a baby, know their names.
So yeah, and then we've got the old lady down the street that is basically like glue lady.
If I said she's Esme, that would make sense to Martin, probably not so much to Jason.
She's the Esme of our street.
Everybody knows her.
Everybody loves her.
She is brilliant and she always knows what's going on.
Forgive me.
I might have forgotten something.
What do you mean by Esme?
Oh, maybe you don't know.
Maybe I'm aging myself again.
A famous Australian show called a country practice. There was the busybody old lady. Her name was Ismay
And so therefore an Australian
Personality type who always knows what's going on is Ismay. Question. What is a glue lady?
Can you clarify that?
Like, you know, you have those people that everybody orbits around that person and she maintains the connections between everybody.
So she can tell you what's going on at number 14.
And so you find out later because she's told you and then she'll relay your news back to number 14 later.
God, that makes sense.
She's the glue in the sense she's holding the community together.
Yes.
Got it.
Otherwise, she has a really big collection of you who glue sticks if you need one
I want to know what you think about the whole concept of smart glasses now
I don't know if you watched this ad that I linked in the show notes to the Xiaomi smart glasses
those are
Atrocious they're hideous. I don't know how many different ways I can say. This is an awful idea. They're so ugly
I don't understand what any of that functionality has to do with anything.
And no, it's hard pass.
See, I thought it was interesting to talk about this because, as other podcasters have
spoken about before, just with broadly the concept of smart glasses in some form, because
we know that Apple's been rumored to do something like this for years because of all their AR
kit stuff.
It really, really comes down, before you even get to the technological side, just how they
look.
Now, this is one company's interpretation.
Now I looked at it and I thought, not my style, they seem kind of like normal sunglasses or
reading glasses, but they're a little bit chunky and you've got the camera thing on
them.
So fashion-wise, it's going to be, "Hmm, nah, don't like it."
Or, "Yeah, they're okay straight away."
But what do you both think, like on the record, before Apple ever does such a thing like this,
if they do, what do you think about, I suppose, the philosophy of this technology or its usefulness?
I think it's terrible.
I don't understand why, so we're going through constantly
about everybody's freaking out about screen time,
screen time, oh my God, the screen time.
You know what you can do with a phone?
You can put it in your pocket and not look at it.
You know what you can do with some (beep) in your face?
Nothing.
It is in your, your screen time app
is gonna be 100% always forever.
I don't understand how we can have this completely
Opposed view of how bad screens are but yet everybody's like well, of course, we got to build one and shove it on your face
Obviously, I the whole smart glasses thing is absolutely just bad
It's just not good. I
See no world in which this
Iteration or another one is going to be no. I I just don't think this is a good way to go
I think it the
Cons just will always stay
Four steps ahead of the pros in this respect
Especially with privacy and stuff and everybody's freaking out about everybody's viewing what I'm doing
Oh my gosh when it's just ads and how they work and then they're like
But it's cool if everyone just has a camera on their face constantly forever looking at God knows what?
And like you you're at dinner and so he pulls out a phone
It's like are we gonna like do this or what do we think that's already weird now
You've got glass Martin's got glasses on right now. No one can see that is he
Engaged in the conversation right now, or is he playing solitaire in DOS mode on his on his Facebook smart glasses
If he's playing Arcadia, I'm okay with it. Well, I mean, that's fair. Yeah, he's probably doing the
He was doing that on his watch off-screen anyway, so I guess that's not much of a departure
But no this smart glass thing. This is just another thing where tech is chasing a problem
That doesn't exist just so they can be first. Yeah, it's it's just terrible. I mean
How distracting would that be and also I could just imagine the sort of the the sick feeling you would get
I don't know if you guys when you if you've ever used those oculus rift glasses or anything
I find that they're fine for 20 minutes or so. And then after that, I'm like, I feel sick
I feel really queasy. I can't imagine having that kind of rubbish on my face the whole time
And I don't need to see my email and my messages that urgent literally
No one does pop up Tim Cook himself does not need to see that an email came in right now if that's the case then
You're running your business incorrectly if it's that critical that you see something the first second you get it
You have a much bigger problem than that email and I think everything that they sort of showed is okay messages
HUD for directions and stuff all that is probably better served by audio
Anyway, which they have we have now and you don't look like a doofus and the other cool thing about wearables like air pods
Like if you're talking about audio or galaxy buds or whatever, you've got things like the transparency modes
So you can still have settings where you're walking through the world not completely distracted
There's no way that this thing on your face can recede in any way
Have you guys ever used the haptics in the Apple watch for directions where it'll do like a one kind of buzz for a left
Turn another kind of buzz for a right turn when you're just walking around
I found that to be brilliant where you can just walk. You don't have to have your phone out doing this
Especially if it's a place where maybe you shouldn't be just hey, here's my
$2,000 phone like just come steal it. You can just be walking along and it's like
You're like, okay go left and then three buzzes or whatever go, right?
Like yeah, the haptic thing is a great one I've found.
The only thing that I could think of that was a positive about this, and I think it
kind of goes hand in hand with the idea like VR is a very cool thing, but it's really,
really good for gaming.
You can't really go outside with it or do anything overly mainstream outside of that.
This I see may be potentially good for accessibility purposes.
If someone has maybe a vision impairment and it helps them with navigation or something,
Or maybe if it were used in like extreme sports, GoPro style facial photography.
But that's it.
That's all I could really come up with.
Yeah, I put VR and this kind of thing in two different camps.
Whereas I see VR as a, you're going into a mode purposefully to do a task versus this
passive, just something's on your face.
How many wasted hours have there been on people blogging about notifications and
how to tame your notifications on your Apple watch or your Google watch or
whatever?
And it's like, this is going to be a thousand times worse.
A buzz on your wrist versus a flash of a stupid mail envelope in your eyeball.
And now you can see, like when you look at the sun and you just see sunspots,
Now you just see little email envelopes floating around.
Like, I don't know.
This is, this to me is one of the best examples of technology just, and companies really,
just trying to be first.
They want to be the one in the comments that says, "First, we have smart glasses."
And you know what?
You know what I would say about those glasses to wrap it up?
I would say those glasses, they're cactus.
What could you mean by cactus, Andrew?
Cactus.
I said this to Jason in a message the other day.
I said, "It's cactus."
And he came back to me and he was like, "What?"
That one had no...
Usually when you say things, I can kind of be like, "Well, that's sort of like this,
so it probably means that."
Cactus was like...
Was that a type...
Was that an autocorrect?
I'm not sure what's going on here.
Is that a Western Australianism, Martin, or is that an Australianism to say something
is cactus?
Unless it came from another country first of which I'm not aware
I've heard it on the East Coast here as well full Australia can give you another example
I could say my front reticulation is cactus and I need Jacob's help
Well that clears that up. I'm glad you use the example of that because now everybody's on the same page
Here we go. I've looked it up
It was about your MacBook Pro screen. Oh, yeah, that was cactus
Yeah, that was definitely a cactus emoji for hmm cactus means broken the thing about cactus though
Is that I don't I don't understand that just feels like you just picked a word and and that was it. I don't I'm not
Well, how does how does any language work you pick a word and you assign a meaning?
Where does that tie into broken? I?
Would like to see the the just yeah, I would like to see that like well
We started here and we ended up here hence cactus you go. Oh, of course. Okay. I don't know the entomology of it
That's Martin's department. He'll he'll he'll get that figured out and he'll let us know on the next episode. I
Have just looked at urban dictionary
So the second definition is probably the one we're looking for is that dead
Dead or not functioning and quote this bloody washing machine is cactus
Now that hasn't been written by an Australian. I don't know what has I wonder if cactus somehow
Sounds like if you use a really really heavy
Australian accent from some location if somehow cactus sounds like
Something to do with being broken and it was just like no cactus. All right, so Martin do you never say cactus?
Not personally not because I avoid it
It just doesn't enter my vernacular very often, but I'm known for speaking to formally and in a verbose way as I am right now
He could have just said no
foldable phones
So I like played with one for like 12 seconds today. I
Don't get it. I'm very confused as to what's so great about a foldable phone
It has a giant crease down the middle of the screen that is
Beyond in your face and you can feel it. The screen is plastic. I
Get it. It's a gen 1 gen 5 whatever. Okay, it'll get there
But the phone when it's open is like a normal phone very thin and like a you know
Rectangle shape whatever like a phone. So phones look like now they all look the same
Goes in your pocket
But now it's like well, no I can fold it
it. So it's small, but now it's one and a half or two point X times as thick, but a
little shorter. What have I really accomplished there? I'm not, I'm not really understanding
why that's good. Um, just was curious if either of you have used one of these full, you probably
haven't used one, but like seen one or like touched one. I just, this to me again, it
feels like a, somebody came up with an R and D project. It was like, look what I made.
They're like, "Ship it!
We gotta be the first one to have a foldable phone!"
And then, okay, we have a foldable phone.
I just, I'm not seeing the future.
Usually I can kind of see where these things are going, and like, "Oh, I get that this
is going to eventually be that."
But the foldable thing, I'm not picking up.
I touched one at JB HiFi, and I didn't get it.
I didn't get it.
I felt dirty after having touched it.
He was like, this is stupid.
And I moved on and stopped, never thought about it again.
- Yeah, I don't, it has nothing to do with Android either.
Like I don't care, it could literally,
you put iOS on that thing, I don't care.
I just, I don't understand the functional form factor
that this is trying, like what's the problem
that this is trying to solve?
- From the basic viewpoint of let's create something
that saves space, hopefully,
but gives you a bigger screen when you want it.
I think that's a pretty good idea
and I'm glad that people have been creative
and doing something because it is easy to settle into,
here's what our devices look like
and we're never gonna do anything differently
and we're just gonna keep evolving it, right?
It's good that different people
are thinking of different things.
I think what I think is wrong is,
I think there is an issue with just the physics of folding
and I don't know how,
you can put as many generations into it as you like
until you can make some sort of Terminator 2,
T1000 flexi-melting material that reforms itself.
If you keep folding something,
there's gonna be a crease there.
So I can't remember which one it was,
but you've reminded me of when Bill Gates and Steve Jobs
were on stage at the All Things D conference.
I think you can see this on YouTube.
Bill Gates made this very interesting point
about how wouldn't it be cool
if we had this rollout device?
Something that would roll would actually stretch out.
And I think, okay, well, rolling sounds like
it could be made rigid or flexible
and it would stay in place and you could get that.
I just think the folding thing is problematic
because it's always gonna be a little bit broken
or be made of substandard material, at least these days.
And we buy different iPads at different sizes
because they're good for different things.
So just because you've got two devices in one
doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna do the job
of each one of those devices as well as the dedicated one.
So to me at the moment, it's just a world of compromise
with a good intention for some creativity.
(upbeat music)
- And I don't really ever use iCloud email
'cause I have fast mail,
but I thought I'm gonna experiment with something.
I had another domain,
and I thought I'm gonna create a,
the way that you can now use iCloud
to create personal domains.
So they now offer,
you can use your own domain,
your own email at your own domain,
but pipe it through iCloud, which is a new feature.
I can confirm that works and it works well
and it hides all the mail servers
and it does a good job of it.
The only limitation is that you're kind of,
you're limited to within your family unit for,
you can have a number of email addresses,
but they all have to be in your iCloud family unit
for them to get also an email address at that domain,
which--
- So you couldn't use it for like a business,
it's strictly for--
Yeah, yeah, and you can't even use it for a podcast because me and a co-host of a particular podcast
could have, would like to have the same domain name with our names as email addresses, but we're
not an iCloud family, so it doesn't work. But you and David could. Yes, correct. Okay. Correct.
So it's good, and the fact that they also now have that iCloud, that private email relay thing that
that they promote where they give you a randomized email address and it pipes it through to you
and you can subscribe to things using that.
All really good features of iCloud.
I was like, "Wow, email is like really pumping along."
And had me thinking, "Maybe that's it."
Even with those limitations I just mentioned, maybe that's enough for me.
Do I need to keep spending hundreds of dollars on fast mail?
And I was really, really tempted until all of a sudden we have more email innovation
Because 1Password and Fastmail have got together and have created their own masked email solution.
Whereby you can subscribe and create a login, save it into 1Password, it connects to Fastmail
and suddenly you have masked emails in Fastmail as well.
But also saved to your 1Password vault.
So it all happens in one step.
So I think I'm going to have to now stay.
Now, granted, I rage quit 1Password because of Electron, and I've now resubscribed to
1Password because there's still nothing out there that's anywhere near as good.
I am paying for Fastmail already, so I'm not getting any introductory discounts from any
of these dudes, but I think I'm just going to have to stay with them because I think
that's going to continue to be the best email solution.
I have to imagine that no one in the email world saw this coming from iCloud.
Because this feels like one of the most unnatural things from an iCloud standpoint to say, "All
right, we're going to start setting up some MX records and start..."
That just seems like such a not iCloud thing where it's, "You have iCloud mail.
Done."
The end, you use your iCloud address and that's it.
That always just kind of seemed like the way it was supposed to be.
I would love to know how somebody came up and said, "I think we're going to do custom
domains, do some MX record stuff in the background, do some masking, do all this stuff for them."
And that made it through all of the gates of okaying.
I'm shocked.
And then I feel like this one password Fastmail thing had to have been a not gut reaction,
but a strategic reaction to, oh, shoot, they're doing something now finally that actually
may compete with us in some respect.
Because before, if you looked at Fastmail versus iCloud, there's no comparison.
They're two wholly different worlds of how email is handled.
You either use iCloud because that's just what you do or you like really want to do
email stuff with FastMail.
There was a very clear, there was no, I wonder which one I should pick.
You knew where you were going to land.
But now with the custom domain thing, as you did, you went and actually set it up.
It was like, wait a minute, I'm already paying for this because I have all this other stuff.
Does it just do what I need?
And it sounds like it probably does.
The only concern I have or questions that I have are,
'cause I've not done this, I was terrified.
Everything is working so perfectly well for me
with Fastmail for so many years.
I don't wanna ever even try to break that.
So if you set it up through iCloud,
can you still use third-party mail clients
or does that somehow still mean you have,
like you can only use Apple Mail?
No, because everything comes into your iCloud, like IMAP email.
So it's still ultimately IMAP.
So it's still, as long as you can set up an iCloud email account, you can get
your custom domain emails working and you need to be able to go into your DNS
records and set the MX records and DKIMS and all that kind of stuff.
Like is anyone doing that?
I wonder, I wonder how many people are actually going to set that up.
It seems like such a big leap from anything you've ever had to do on an
Apple platform in terms of configuration.
Usually it's like, click a button.
Done.
Like that's like the extent.
Yeah.
There's no way, there's no way you can do this without having to go into it.
Right, because now you've got to have a domain.
You have to know how to set up DNS, MX records, yada, yada, yada, time to live
this or that or the other thing.
It's a real, it's really a departure
from I think what we've seen.
- So do you think, I have a question for you
about this though, because it's not pure iCloud mail
without all of this stuff, right?
Just like mail as you said, mail for mail's sake,
or it's not the full pro thing,
do you think it's kind of in a middle no man's land
in the sense that the people who really like fast mail
aren't gonna wanna use it,
other than maybe Andrew experimenting here,
And that other people just stick with the normal thing.
I think it's perfect for that family tinkerer.
So if you've got like, like we're the Canyon family and we want to have canyonfamily.com and, you know, and we want Andrew and David and Hannah to all have canyonfamily.com email addresses.
Bang.
There it is.
You're already in your family group.
It's already set.
Yeah.
One setting.
It's, I think that is probably who they're aiming at.
And that is probably the fat bit of the curve in typical Apple style.
You know, that the full on nerds will either want, um, fast mile stuff or the
people who just, you know, then there's the other people who just stay in the
Google world or what have you.
It's, um, so I think it's a bit of a reaction against all the Google and the
Microsoft and who all offer that stuff.
Oh yeah.
Maybe more of a attack at G suite and all that more so than something like a
a fast mail that's already very privacy conscious,
security conscious, and like all the kind of,
checks all the boxes for that stuff.
But it's still a, like you gotta be,
it's super easy to, well, it's easy-ish, I would say,
to set up fast mail in a general sense.
It's not the worst thing.
You're not like writing code or something to do it.
But that being said, in terms of email,
when you look at something like create a Gmail account
verse do a fast mail setup.
It's pretty hardcore and like you really have to have a reason to do it.
And it's not, it's not like it's free either. It's pretty costly.
I mean it's worth it by every stretch. Their prices are fine.
I'm not saying they're not, but you know,
when we're in this world of everything is free and then you say, well,
this is, is it a hundred dollars a year or whatever?
$50 a year, whatever it is.
That's a tough thing. And I think unless you really know you want it,
but now like you said, the iCloud one,
you're probably already paying for it because you have iCloud stuff.
So I think the main,
the other main thing coming out of this for me is that I can't believe this is
actual innovation happening in a moribund space.
Email and all that has been sort of,
it's just plumbing of the internet that nobody cares about.
And all of a sudden there's been innovation.
Can I just commend you on using the word moribund?
I love that. Thank you man. Can I commend you on using innovation three times in a row?
No, I'm sticking with the Morrow band. I do have one wrench to throw in your thing
here. This whole private relay email addresses and one password make a different email address
for everything you ever email. This is another area where I'm kind of like, sounds cool,
But like, kind of who cares?
Because all those emails are coming to me anyway.
So now I've got emails coming into my inbox from a hundred different addresses instead
of just to one.
And now I have to micromanage all of these made up addresses that are like XY3B72 at
whatever.
And it's like, what was that one for again?
Oh, that was for...
But that's the thing, you don't micromanage it.
That's where 1Password comes into the mix, because they micromanage it for you.
But now I've got 800 email addresses in my 1Password.
Is that really fixing anything, or am I just sort of trying to push the problem down the
road?
Well, it makes the email address disposable.
So if you're sick of hearing from that person, there's no unsubscribing or worrying about
who have they sold my email address to.
You just delete that email address, and suddenly all your worries are gone.
It just feels like a lot of work. I don't know just make a filter and throw it in the auto trash it
It just feels like a lot of work for managing email, which doesn't seem to be that big of an issue
Maybe maybe that's just me. So are you doing this now? Are you doing the fast mail one? Are you doing the iCloud one?
Well, I've still got fast mail subscription for another year. So I'm not doing anything at the moment
I've got the iCloud set up on one domain because I have a spare domain though
But the one password thing are you doing that with your fast mail?
Yeah, I did the connection thing
And I'm doing the fast one, but I haven't had anything to subscribe to yet
I haven't had had cause to actually invoke it, but I've set it all up. So you're back on fast mail
You're back on one password. Yeah
Yeah, are we still mad at one password?
Are we are we are we collectively over that on the Internet? Are we on to a new thing yet?
No, no, we're still we're still angry, but we appreciate that they they recognize
the the angst that they have caused the community and I feel that they're making progressive steps towards
Improving that situation as mr. Default here. I'd like to say that I'm still enjoying iCloud keychain. I
Upgraded to an iPhone 13 mini
It is very small. My finger keeps getting in the way of the camera lens
I'm having to learn to re-hold the phone because I keep
Just expecting a bigger phone, but then yesterday I held my wife's iPhone 12
normal and
It seemed comically large. So I think I'm already coming around to the iPhone 12 mini way or I think 13 mini way of life
No, well, I'm really enjoying the pocket ability of the iPhone 13 mini even with my jumbo hands
I think I'm doing okay with it
Is your finger is it in both?
lenses or only when you do the wide angle because sometimes I'll that happen to me with the wide angle where it'll be like the
little half top of my finger because I'm kind of holding it.
Sorry to clarify, are you talking ultra wide?
Shoot. Yes. Sorry.
Ultra wide.
It's probably more problematic with that one if I think about it.
Yeah, but it was it's kind of a shocker than you.
I'm just getting used to it and figuring out how do I hold this
so I can still take a photo?
But overall, I do love it.
The other huge change this phone has brought about
is this is my first ever OLED screen and oh my goodness it is incredible. I've come from an
iPhone XR and even though I have an iPad Pro which still has LCD so this I've never had an
OLED screen and I've always known that they're good but it's not until you use it every day and
you kind of live with it and you take photos with it that the photos and then you go into video mode
and it goes into HDR and it's like the screen just goes and lights up vivid vivid color it's
incredible yeah it's not quite like going to to uh retina but like it's the next where you're like
Wow, I can actually see the difference.
O-L-E-D.
