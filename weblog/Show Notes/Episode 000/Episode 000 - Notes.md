In this pilot episode that originally published on Martin's Podcast [Lounge Ruminator](https://loungeruminator.net) we speak about our shared love of digital technology, the pros and cons of product and network lock-in, the trials and tribulations of email and differences in coffee culture. Since we enjoyed recording this episode so much, we have decided to spin it off into a new show, **this show**, Hemispheric Views. We hope you enjoy!
