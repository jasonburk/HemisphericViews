Hello, this is Andrew.
Starting off Hemispheric Views with a very important announcement.
It's June, which means it's Arcadia June!
Now if you don't know what Arcadia is, you need to check our archives.
In episode 29 last year, Arcadia Dune as an event came into being as part of the Hemispheric
Views universe.
Then in episode 31, it featured an interview with Irene who supports the developer Raffaele
with the game.
Check both those episodes for full details, but let me give you the quick rundown.
June is an opportunity for you to play the iOS game Arcadia and compete with
other listeners of Hemispheric Views for the high score and a fantastic prize.
Eric won the prize last year, we don't want Eric to win again do we? It's up to
to prevent that. We need you to play the various games on Arcadia. Log your high scores and let us
know what they were via discord or even email hello@hemisphericfuse.com. We just want to know
what you're scoring. Arcadia is a game you can play anywhere on iOS. You can play it on your phone,
You can play it on Apple TV. You can even play it on your Apple Watch.
So there's no excuse not to play and not to have fun with Arcadia Dune.
And what's more the developer of Arcadia, Raffaella, has generously provided
some codes for us to use or to give away that will enable the lucky recipients of said codes
to access the game, download the game, a copy of it for free. But if you don't get that code,
don't worry, it's very affordable on the App Store. We're talking on just a few dollars.
So whether you get the code, whether you still have the download from last year's Arcadia June,
or you're a new listener and you want to play this year, please join in. It's a huge event.
We love it. Arcadia June. Let's get gaming.
When you do your professional sportscaster job that you do now,
do you have that type of setup for that? Or do you constantly throughout the entire thing think,
"Man, this could be a lot better if they would let me set this up"?
No, it's a pretty good setup. Although the headphone and microphone,
the quality of the equipment, leaves little to be desired.
I can attest you do not sound,
A, you don't sound like you, first of all.
The you that I know, which is this.
But to be fair, when you're doing your alternate persona,
and maybe that's part of it,
maybe you are, you know, different person.
- I'm a basketball guy.
- Yeah, maybe you are a basketball guy at that point.
I honestly thought I was watching the wrong recording
because I was like, I don't, I mean,
it kind of maybe sounds,
but I didn't think it was you until I confirmed.
So they got some weird setup going on over there, I think.
- Is it fair to say that maybe on this podcast,
Andrew adopts a persona of business
and technological authority,
there's presence and resonance.
Whereas on the sports show,
he's more of a, not generic necessarily,
but a man of the people.
He's a relatable every man.
- I thought that could be it.
But then I remembered NBL Pocket Podcast,
which is the most sportsy of sports things
that one can listen to.
And I know that from experience
and having no idea what's going on
throughout the entire thing.
But even then, difference.
So I don't know.
I think maybe it's a chemistry thing, partially.
Could be, right?
NBL Pocket Podcast, chemistry there.
This show, something's going on here.
We're not sure what, but something.
- I wanna know, so this basketball thing.
So they give me an Audio Technica headset.
So it's got the integrated microphone.
The mixer is ancient and the levels, like you exceed the levels allocation very easily.
It's very crackly and poppy. That's not great. And I just want to know at what point,
how many games in is it totally legitimate to bring along in a little backpack my own mixer
and just say, "Look, can we integrate this equipment into the show?"
The fact that it hasn't happened already is shocking to me. I don't know how you didn't
show up with your little Pelican case, brand it on the side, pop it open. It's got a mixer,
it's got a microphone, it's got a headset. And you're like, "Hey, you just kind of shove all
that other stuff off the desk, right? Plop all your stuff down and say, "Now we're going to make
a show." Let me show you how this is going to go. I haven't done that, but I did have, because the
The last game we did was sort of a bigger event.
It was on the KO service,
the streaming sports service in Australia.
- There you go.
- So he had additional production crew there
and the guy just leaned over at one point
and just readjusted my microphone very gently.
- Wow.
- Just to make sure my levels were just right.
Yeah, I was like, oh, that's good service.
- This is what it means to be talent.
nbl1.com.au/west if you want to go straight to the Western Australian edition.
Look for any games featuring home games by Perth Redbacks, men and women.
You can watch at your leisure.
It's still available. You can watch them.
/east if you want the superior side of Australia.
Just saying.
Here we go.
Turn it up.
I actually, that actually brings up an interesting question because obviously in the US, in the
US, East versus West is very, it's a thing, surely, right?
Like they're very different, basically in every conceivable way.
And the West Coast is the best coast because it rhymes with best, so.
Because it's full of chill steiners, yep.
Yes, right.
East Coast has nothing to offer. So there goes that part of our audience.
East Coast is full of business people and politicians wearing suits.
Yeah. If you need to cancel your Patreon, patreon.com/cancel,
if you're on the East Coast, so that makes that easy. Um, but is,
I assume, is there something similar in Australia,
other than you guys just kind of f***ing with one another? Like,
is there like a East versus West kind of thing or not as
much, uh, there?
The East typically gets all attention and gets to go first. So out of the graciousness and compassion of my heart, I'm going to let Andrew go first.
Even though you technically just went first.
Yeah.
Okay.
The West Coast of Australia, because it's just one state and really one city, we're very isolated.
In half the country.
In half the country. And the profitable half of the country, because we have all the resources. So we make all the money for the country entirely, which then gets siphoned off to the East Coast.
There's also a lot of beautiful domestic agriculture that happens in the wetter temperate areas
of the east that ends up fueling the nation.
Sorry, go on.
I interrupted you there, but that's fine.
Sorry to interrupt on that industrial corner.
But there is definitely a divide.
There is absolutely a divide.
The West Coast basically feels like it's a forgotten side of the country.
It's basically deemed irrelevant by the rest of Australia.
And so we are constantly-
So what are we talking about again?
And so we basically call the men in the East, the wise men from the East.
Think that they know more, understand more, and are more powerful.
So we basically try and forget that the East Coast exists, because they always forget that
we exist.
I feel like Tasmania gets a rougher trot than just about every state in the country.
Everyone makes jokes about that, perhaps unreasonably, but of the kind of genetic quality of people
from Tasmania. You don't get those jokes. No, they just get high viz.
No, we don't get those jokes. I'm just being honest. We're not all related to one another.
Can I be fair, Jason? This is something that never enters my headspace.
Like, I don't even think, like, I just think this is a great opportunity to piss off
Andrew on the podcast when you ask those questions.
Yeah, and that's what it was meant for fully.
So, but it is interesting that it tends to be East versus West here.
And to some degree, it's kind of similar there, I think.
So what's your position, Martin, on the East Coast? Do you have a view?
Of the West Coast?
Yeah, or of the East Coast's greatness?
Well, look, as I said, I like to hammer it up for this podcast, but all that kind of thing, and this is a whole other discussion of things like state of origin between New South Wales and Queensland with rugby, which just kind of annoys me to know and how it's even a popular thing.
Well, you know what I mean? Like, it doesn't even... There's an example of East Coast centrism,
right? The fact that two states think that the rest of the nation cares about some ridiculous
marketed sports rivalry. Anyway, I suppose what I would say is there are people who care about
this sort of thing. And it's like, oh, which one's better, Sydney or Melbourne? Or, you know,
what's the deal with Queensland? Or, you know, we like Adelaide for festivals, but it's kind of
boring. And what's the deal with Perth? They're just out in the middle of the desert there. There
There are some people who actually hold onto these stereotypes, but of all the cities and
towns that I've visited, I think everyone's more similar than what they probably think.
And I visited Perth once and I thought it was lovely.
So I don't really care for any of these arbitrary borders, but I still like to give Andrew crap.
Yeah, I think that's fair.
Yeah.
My only issue with either side is that they're so far apart and that for me to get to both
is going to be a very big pain in the ass, but it will be worth it.
but it will be a pain in the ass.
(upbeat music)
- One Prime Plus, there's a new member.
Who is it, Jason? - Oneprimeplus.com
is how you get there.
And the new member is John Jay.
Thank you so much, John,
for your membership of oneprimeplus.com.
We love that you found it and have joined us
in this thing we call Hemispheric Views.
I do wanna give a reminder
that it is in fact open to the entire world.
So there is no queue.
You can all sign up at the same time.
It's totally fine.
You don't have to wait for anyone else.
For John specifically, if you give us an address,
if you would like some cool sticker merch, let us know.
We can send that to you for your membership.
And also there is bonus content going back probably
at least over a year now, I think,
of episodes, blog posts, we've got the newsletter
that's every month.
So there's been, have we had a year on the newsletter yet?
I can't recall.
- That would be very close if we haven't,
maybe one month off.
- It's gotta be pretty damn close.
So you got at least 10, 11 newsletters in there to check out,
which for the most part, I would say,
well, I would say in general,
the show overall is mostly evergreen,
but I think a lot of the blog post type stuff
tends to be evergreen. There's not really,
we don't focus heavily on the kind of here and now as much as a lot of places.
So most of that stuff is probably still pretty good for you.
And then we've got a bunch of episodes that you can check out.
That's some cutting room floor stuff,
some just very specific to one prime plus,
and then some just straight up bonus that no one else gets.
So one prime plus.com. Thank you, John. Um,
Everyone is free to join again.
And we really encourage everybody to go in the Discord
because that's kind of like the best place
to chat with everybody.
We've got a fun little community in there.
- And that's for everybody.
That's not just One Prime Plus.
- That is correct.
Yeah, the Discord is for everyone.
There is a specific One Prime Plus channel in there
that is locked to One Prime Plus
to talk about various things related to the program
or different events that we have from time to time.
We do live watches of movies.
we're doing a live watch of Severance right now,
episode by episode with commentary with the community.
And I'm sure we're gonna have a bunch of other
crazy things coming up for the remainder of the year.
So if you haven't heard the good word,
oneprimeplus.com is the place to be.
(upbeat music)
- I'm excited to know some follow up.
I can see a robot head, which denotes Jason.
follow up on iPad screen apps, in parentheses,
handwritten notes.
- That is correct.
So we talked about iPad screens the other,
actually, was that a OnePrime+?
That might've been, coincidentally, maybe it wasn't.
I don't recall now, but.
- I think it was a topic suggestion, that's right.
So yet another reason OnePrime+.
- There you go, yeah, you get to suggest topics as well.
So we talked about our iPad home screens
and just sort of how we had them laid out.
We talked about what apps were on there
and not so much app by app,
but just sort of our thinking around how we use the iPad,
I think was probably more closely
to what we were talking about
versus just going app by app
from top left to bottom right.
And one of the things we talked about a little bit
was handwritten notes on the iPad, iPad Pro specifically,
and how that is a useful tool,
but we've touched on good notes,
we touched on notability and how the consensus,
I believe, and I'm speaking a little bit for both of you,
was that they're both pretty good.
Neither one is like way out ahead of the other
in terms of what we prefer.
It's just sort of, this is the one I've been using,
so I'm gonna keep using it.
I came across another one,
and so I just wanted to bring it up for everybody
to try out if they're into handwritten notes,
called Pen Book.
And it's been quite good,
and I'm liking the way that it is laid out.
And that's really the big difference here.
In terms of handwritten notes, they all do handwritten notes.
Use the Apple Pencil and they write notes.
Nothing profound.
But, pen book I'm finding has a nice layout
in the way that you get new paper
and the quickness with which you can change paper layouts
and you can get new paper layouts if you wanna do,
I'm saying paper, but just, you know,
basically the background that you don't edit
you're writing on top of. If you want to do like an agenda or a dot grid or a line or whatever.
It's just, it's, it's another option I didn't know about. I just sort of stumbled upon it. So
pen book is an option if you want to do handwritten notes on the iPad. And that's the one I've been
using now over notability or good notes. - It's currently got 4.6 out of 5 on the
Australian app store. - There you go.
- 473 ratings. So I've never heard of it, but somebody has.
Yeah, I had not heard of it either. I believe I came across it completely accidentally looking
through the App Store for something else. And there you go, discoverability actually
worked for me. So yeah, pen book, check it out.
The thing that I love about hearing about Node apps from people is you have potentially
opened a Pandora's box of people entering some sort of existential note crisis and upending
their entire note filing and writing system. So I'm a little bit worried that we're going
other discord and people are going to be like, "Oh, I was using this and I'm using that and I
don't know what to do." So. - There's at least 14 people that thought they had the perfect solution
and now have just crushed their entire world from beneath them and just taken out the foundation
and now they have to start all over. - I just tried to load that on my Safari,
their website on Safari for iOS. And of course it didn't load because of that bug that we've
been discussing. I just went and flipped that toggle, flipped that toggle and then it loaded.
That's so weird because I don't understand. I don't have that issue, which is so strange.
I have everything the same as you and David was talking about that. I feel like you and I,
Andrew, would be different, just geographically separated. There could be weirdness or something.
But he's like right above me effectively, like he's one state up very close.
So I would think that would be the same, but I have not seen any of these issues you all
are talking about.
It's so weird.
So just to quickly summarize, the last few days, and the only variable I can put it down
to is since the latest iOS update.
15.5, right?
15.5.
I've been having safari, just having random problems loading some websites.
It would just, the little progress bar will commence
and then it would just hang there,
white page, nothing loading.
David did some great research
'cause I was complaining on Discord about it.
If you go into the iOS settings for Safari,
scroll down to the privacy and security section,
there is a hide IP address toggle.
Usually, and appropriately,
that would be hide from trackers.
If you turn that, go into that and say, turn it off,
it sounds scary,
and you're probably giving up some layer of privacy.
- For now, I'm sure this is temporary, right?
I mean, I imagine whatever this is will be resolved.
- Hopefully we'll flip the bit,
like yeah, we'll flip it back.
But then go back into Safari
and just see if your webpages load without any problems,
because we are finding,
David and I are finding that that seems to be the solution.
Well, I went through everything,
So I usually use NextDNS as a alternate DNS provider/ad blocker.
I turned that off, I went back to my ISP DNS, still having problems and it was just a, I
couldn't figure out what it might be.
And so David H came to the rescue with that solution.
You can also do it on the Mac in system preferences and then you go into networks.
is a toggle for limit IP address tracking under your internet settings.
It seems like basically the same sort of toggle and that only affects mail and Safari too.
So if you're having problems with those, that would be hopefully a temporary solution, but
it's just bizarre.
It's so weird.
And again, I would emphasize if nothing seems weird to you, don't do anything like you're
fine. But it seems like for whatever reason, there must be other variables
involved here that are causing, you know, X to conflict with Y to conflict with
Z or something weird is going on. Because like, I'm looking on every system in my
house and not seeing any of this, which is extra weird. You'd think it would be
at least one of them, but I don't know. I went immediately to ISP because I
I figured since I'm okay and you both were having issues,
maybe it was down at that level,
but it does seem like it's further upstream.
I don't know.
It's weird.
- I will say, I've just done another test on my Mac here.
I flipped that Safari bit off and loaded a website,
the one that was just causing me problems.
And then I just did the same thing, loaded it in Firefox,
and it was much quicker in Firefox.
So maybe Safari is not doing so well.
Maybe it's time for a browser switch up.
- That's the other interesting thing too,
is like these websites are not,
it's not like you're going to weird, questionable websites.
It was like some paint website,
like literally like a paint painting,
or I think maybe it was actually to buy paint.
Yours was like ESPN, like the most generic basic of sites.
So it wasn't like you were trying to go to like some weird esoteric...
Also on the dark web.
Yeah, it wasn't anything even remotely strange.
It was probably in the top 10 websites visited on the internet ever.
So maybe I'm going to have to switch my browser.
Maybe I'm going to have to go back to Firefox and Edge or...
I've tried.
I've tried.
It doesn't...
You can't.
You can't.
You can't switch.
Because of the iOS sync?
Is that the issue?
Or Apple Pay?
- Well, iOS sync is nice,
but most browsers have sync amongst themselves.
The biggest things are Apple Pay support.
You cannot do Apple Pay in any other browser.
It does not happen.
I know people talk about iMessage
being a lock-in or whatever.
No, no.
This would be an actual definition of lock-in.
iMessage, you can default back to SMS.
It's not great, but it works.
This is literally only in Safari.
The other one is when you still run across
that random bank website or something,
you need to do a two-factor based on SMS.
- I love that feature.
- And it auto-fills it in.
No one else is doing that.
Not gonna happen.
So those two things are so huge.
You would think like, oh, what's the big deal?
It's just Apple, tell you what, you go to buy something,
it's a pain in the ass to not be able to just do touch ID
and go on, so.
- That two-factor SMS code as well.
I think I've talked about that before,
I might have blogged about it.
I love that feature. - It's so good.
- 'Cause it comes up just often enough
that it's annoying when it happens.
- That's one of those features where you're like,
this is magic.
That is one of those magical features
where when it happens, you go,
Oh my gosh, I understand why this is so great
because this just happened.
I did nothing.
Could I have gone and copy and pasted?
I could have, but you know what?
I didn't.
I just clicked the thing and it was done.
So those two things.
- So Safari, it wins.
It won't load half your webpages,
but it will fill in your SMS code.
So therefore it's the best browser.
(laughs)
(upbeat music)
Now we've got another robot.
We've got trying a new keyboard
and then in parentheses and a new additional monitor thing.
I've, I've,
my office has been just bastardized and I don't know who to talk to about it.
I was hoping you all could be like,
I could lay on the couch and talk about it and you would console me and tell me
that it's going to be all right for like $200 an hour. Does that sound fair?
Absolutely.
I got a new keyboard, which also brings up another interesting thing.
We were just talking about how Apple Pay
and the SMS code thing for Safari,
no Touch ID on a different keyboard, sucks.
It sucks so hard.
So if we could get a little standardized Touch ID button
for quite literally don't care how much it costs,
I want one 'cause right now I've got a stupid
whole keyboard sitting over here
just to use the Touch ID button.
And it's ridiculous.
But the bigger thing is this other monstrosity next to me,
which is a monitor.
It's a 32 inch monitor.
- It's big.
It's really big.
- But it's not, it's tall.
I've got it vertical, off to the right.
- This is a larger display than my main one
used as a side panel.
- Same.
My main panel is a 24 inch iMac.
So it's even more comical in your office.
- It's hilarious.
So I have, let me paint a picture for you
so you can laugh at this.
- Please.
- 24 inch iMac.
Everything's sleek, nice.
Everybody loves it.
It's just like, ooh, this is what life could be.
Above it, 13 inch iPad.
Sure, why wouldn't you do that?
Then to the right, 32 inch vertical monitor.
just over there.
My poor standing desk is like the motors
are having difficulty going up and down at this point.
It's ridiculous.
But I kinda like it.
It's actually really good.
And let me tell you why.
I've said before, I think on record,
I'm not a two monitor person.
I'm not the kind of person that has two monitors next to me.
- No, you're a three monitor person.
- Right, yeah, see?
Not a two monitor, three monitor.
But like, you know the classic two monitors
next to each other normally
with the big giant bezel in the middle.
I can't, no, that's terrible.
I hate it.
I hate looking at bezel directly in the center of my view.
But there's so many things that I run day-to-day work-wise
that I want as quite literally a dashboard.
I want to have Slack up to be visible, glanceable.
Asana, I use Asana a ton for very--
the project management.
- Exactly.
I use that a ton and I always want that within view
so that I can quickly reference and see
what thing is where within a project.
And then calendar, I like to be able to glance as well
without bringing it up into my main view.
So now I've got this awkwardly weird,
stupid dashboard thing next to me
with these windows on it.
It works great.
I really like it.
It just looks stupid, but I think that's okay, right?
If it's functional and looks stupid, that's okay.
Is that correct?
Do I have that right?
- No.
- No?
- No, it's okay.
- Well, Andrew, you had a vertical monitor to the side.
What do you think of this?
- I love the idea of a vertical monitor.
I think they're really cool.
I do have a secondary monitor as well.
It's a Dell.
It's one that we bought for my wife and she rejected it.
So I was like, I can't have something go to waste.
So I've had it, I turn it on.
I don't have it on all the time.
I turn it on as required.
For a period of time, I had it in the portrait orientation,
but it's a 27 inch, I think.
And I found I was getting neck strain
looking up at the top of it.
'Cause it was taller than my iMac display.
So I've switched it back to portrait.
Now, and it's okay, I've tried the dashboard thing
and it just never sticks.
It just never kind of works,
but I do use it as just a random
when I need to move stuff over on the other screen.
I can't ever get a window layout
that's perfectly sticks in a position.
My windows go all over the place.
But the idea of a portrait 32 inch,
I don't know how you're seeing the top of that screen.
You need binoculars.
- It's actually working.
as much as it pains me to have this like giant ugly thing on my desk. I mean, it's not, to
be fair, it's not, the monitor's fine. The monitor's, it's just huge. But now I've got
my whole iMac freed up to just do my day to day stuff and be able to glance over. I'm
doing it right now. I've got you all on the iMac so I can look at you.
Oh, we're not on the iPad.
Show notes up at the top no this is this more intimate this is not a meeting this is an intimate situation.
He's he's locked onto our eyes he's not referring to something else.
I don't want you think I'm looking away I want you to be looking into my eyes deep deep into my eyes so I've got show notes I've got my notes and I've got you know audio hijack at the bottom it's great.
All of this, the iPad screen above, the big giant stupid thing to the right,
these were not new, these were things that just existed in the house already.
I thought you were going down the path of these are not three devices.
No, these are not. Are you getting it? It's an iPad above your monitor, it's an iMac,
and it's a 32-inch ugly thing next to it. These are all one thing called my desk.
Yeah. No, these are just all things I had in the house already.
So I, you know, I experiment. I try things.
So Playdate Corner.
Playdate Corner.
All right, so quickly, Playdate Corner, which is the yellow square emoji,
which good for good, you know, thinking ahead on their part
that there already was an emoji for the device.
Good call on that.
A couple of games that I wanted to mention for playdate enthusiasts.
Pickpack pup.
Fantastic game.
It comes with the device in one of the weeks.
Love it.
Flipper lifter.
Third party side load.
Fun game.
Is that pinball?
No, it's like this game where you're an elevator operator with the crank and
you're trying to get penguins to different levels of the hotel that they're trying
to get to.
Oh, of course.
Yeah, obviously. I mean, it's pretty self explanatory.
Flipper lifter. Come on. Um,
bubble collect another third party side load. I'm,
I'm mentioning these because I'm,
I'm so happy with how many third party side load games there are on.
I've been finding them all on itch.io.
I don't know if people are familiar with that.
It is a place to get all manners of content, but it's a,
It's a marketplace for people to sell their wares.
So Bubble Collect is another one.
And then Casual Burter is another one that I'm back onto now
after beating Pickpack Pup, which is also within the weekly releases.
To say that Playdate still two major thumbs up.
Love it. Can't say enough about it.
And what's it Pool Suite?
Oh, Pool Suite.
We touched on that when we were talking about the Playdate,
because there's the little dock that it's going to have at some point where you can have on your desk and it'll have the Pool Suite FM app for the playdate.
And it got me listening to Pool Suite and it plays quite literally 24/7 in my house now.
I can't stop.
It's so good.
Are you just wiping lotion all over yourself, you know, as the sun comes through the window?
I am just lubing up listening to Pool Suite FM. It's my favorite thing now. Do either of you
listen to that, I guess, app? Intermittently, yes. It's good.
Oh my gosh. It's just- Not as much as you do, clearly.
Oh, it's the best. It's so good. What is your favorite station? I have to ask.
I think I mentioned last time it was the Tokyo Disco one.
Same. Yes. It's the best. It's the best station. It's so good.
But it's kind of what I like about it is that it's clearly retro and nostalgic and cheesy,
which fits the app, but it's also kind of modern. So you listen to it, you go,
"Oh, this is kind of funky." So it's like old and new again. Sorry, old is new again, like the app.
I have never felt cool in my life except listening to Poolsuite FM.
So listeners, try Poolsuite FM and tell us if you also feel cool.
All right now.
Foot gaming corner.
I thought it would throw you off to put a foot next to a gaming controller in our notes.
It's really mundane white news as in mundane white man news, which is in no way, you know, important to anyone.
But yeah, I got a new Xbox.
A whole new console.
What like the like a proper Xbox?
Yeah, Series X.
You got a Series X?
Holy shit this guy. Yes. Did you see my discord commentary the other day trying to fuck?
He held that he held that over your head like I'm gonna drop this on you so hard
During the recording I didn't mean to be spiteful Natasha found that like a an exchange place where they refurbish them
It's actually I think it was bought and instantly handed back. So I went and snapped it up. Oh my gosh. This is amazing
I look can we can we mark a calendar?
Set fire John John get that on the calendar series X Martin tag it down thank you.
Holy hell.
Welcome to the next expected to inspire this much welcome to the next generation can you get one for me.
Well this is my first new console in about 16 years so I thought.
What is well okay so hoping playing forza no doubt I'm sure.
I've been trying some things it's been interesting to see a halo in such high resolution I'm sure.
Let's spend nice absolutely your 4k 60 I just thought look at this yeah that's right that's right.
But the funny thing is this is what I this is the huge kind of I suppose seismic shift in gaming
which I just completely skipped. So I think I mentioned before played the original Xbox,
played Xbox 360 locally at home for years. The internet never really kind of worked and I didn't
really care. I didn't need to get online to play my games. So I have this whole history of local
stuff but different live account made through the whole Xbox or sorry like Microsoft profile. So if
if you find me on like the system, it's like this piddly score as if like,
Martin is new to games, be gentle on him.
Yes.
Like, it's like I've never touched anything before, but I'm like, eh, whatever.
So yeah, it's been fun to experiment with it.
And it's a large black box object, which actually fits the name.
And I'm glad they put the green back in it.
Is it very noisy?
No, it's totally quiet, which is such, that's probably the biggest upgrade from the 360,
because the 360 sounds like an industrial cooling system for a warehouse or something.
Martin would hear the 360 and think he was at work at the blast furnaces because like that
shit was awful. It does approach that. Yes.
So what did you see your gamer tag is Feldmeister? Am I assuming that's correct?
I think that might have already been taken. Although I am Feldmeister and other things. I
think it's MJW Feld. You can find me there, but nothing much interesting. That's my initials.
Wow, look at that. So, wow, Xbox Series X, I love this. I love everything about that.
Because I would have guessed you would have been like, I'll just get a Series S, it's fine. But
you were like, no, I'm going for it. Well, I figured I've got the 4K TV.
Rationalizing it as well, trying to find one, not being able to find one and going,
oh, I'm sure the S will be fine. I'm sure it'll be fine.
I mean, no one really needs such a thing, but the way I rationalized it, because, you know, we all justify these things, is I hadn't had one that was new for years.
I got plenty of use out of that. This is not going to be old or superseded super quickly. Of course, they might do slim versions or, you know, make it smaller, but whatever.
I got such value out of the two previous ones that I got years ago that, yeah, why not?
Why not? And there's pretty fair backwards compatibility, which is good.
I do think they need to go further because there are games that I have on disk,
hence the disk drive interest with the Series X.
I don't think they go far enough.
And there's that little thing that makes me smirk on the Microsoft or Xbox website
that's our promise to you, keeping our promise to you about backward compatibility.
And as far as I'm concerned, the promise is not fulfilled because I have old stuff
that I can't play. And it's probably due to some bizarre licensing issue
or they can't be bothered. So impressed Microsoft, but it's not far enough.
Let's put it that way.
The PlayStation is the same way, but at least there's, and I don't know, I mean,
it doesn't make any better,
but there was the excuse of like from a PS3 standpoint,
it was like this weird architecture thing that they thought was going to be
great. Sure. Ended up not being great.
So I give them a little bit of a pass on that of like,
we're not going to re-architect all these games,
but like for the Xbox side, I'm kind of like, come on guys.
Like.
This is the company that has kept Internet Explorer limping along for so long to keep corporate people happy.
You can make a couple of original Xbox games more compatible or resurrect them.
I will continue to say, though, Xbox Game Pass is the best bang for any gaming dollar that exists in all of gaming.
Game.
That took me over the line.
Game Pass is just so good.
On the PlayStation side, it's a flippin' disaster.
They've had two different things, which I have both.
They're both meh.
Now they've put 'em into one,
which gives me like two mehs into a bigger meh, I guess.
I don't know.
But like Game Pass is just, it's such a good value
in terms of, you know, there's always this kind of like,
oh, I don't wanna subscribe to everything,
but Game Pass is really a good value, I think,
in terms of gaming, amount of gaming you get per dollar,
I don't think you can beat Game Pass.
- Yeah, and I was so impressed
with how it worked on the iPad,
I thought, well, this is cool,
but it's really still not the center of a gaming universe.
It's a cool thing to have and move around with.
And I thought, if I'm enjoying it this much
on this tiny little thing
that's just playing it through a browser,
what's it gonna be like
when there's actually the dedicated box
with the power and the vent for it?
And no, I haven't been disappointed.
It's been really good.
And isn't that wild that you started playing on the iPad?
You started playing Xbox games on the iPad,
then bought an Xbox series.
Like that's just such a weird, in a good way,
direction to go that that's even possible.
I think that says a lot about the way Xbox
thinks about this stuff.
And I think they're very smart, capable, and intelligent
about the way they've built this entire gaming
kind of environment compared to everyone else.
- Very clever.
And it's the sort of integration
and it just works experience
that Apple's generally been famous for.
But I think Microsoft's really done a good job
in this case with gaming.
And I'll be honest with you,
a lot of my nostalgia came back
just from actually watching "Halo" and "Paramount Plus."
It was like that final tick over.
I went, you know what, I loved this game.
I wanna play it through again
and do the ones that I never played
because they were on newer consoles
I didn't have access to so I just went you know what that's it all of these things slowly adding up over years and I just finally got pushed to do it.
I just can't believe you got a console I've been looking everywhere I haven't found one anywhere then I was I wrecked.
Resiled myself to getting the S and then I was like well I need two controllers you can't even buy a second controller.
I'm happy for you but I'm actually also really really pissed off.
Yeah I didn't I didn't mean for it to be like that I was just trying to be mysterious with a magic not to make you feel that it really hits him deep.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm so glad we can have gaming corner going forward now this is gonna be great.
Cool thumbs up next.
My kids have discovered NBA 2k, so I'm excited for them. They're playing 2k 20 on the Nintendo switch
EA have deact is that the one that's on Apple arcade -
Yeah, the new versions on Apple arcade, but it's no good without a controller. You need to play that game with controllers
Yeah, yeah fair enough. It's 2k 20 typical EA. They've just they've turned off the service for it
So you can't the only thing you can do is play
exhibition games basically because they want you to buy the new version and
Use yes, so you can't access servers for NBA 2k 20 on the switch anymore
Media corner I
I thought we would take a topic suggestion from one of our One Prime Plus subscribers, Laker.
Oneprimeplus.com.
Thank you, Laker, for your ongoing subscription and also for this suggestion. Laker asked us,
what are some of our favourite podcasts beyond our own universe, maybe out there in the tech
genre, maybe beyond? I'm not sure. We're going to find out from each other. Who wants to start
off Andrew, maybe you, do you have a podcast recommendation that is perhaps a
bit unexpected? Yeah I've got a number of, I've got a couple of them probably that
I'll go with. NBL Pocket Podcast? Of course NBL Pocket Podcast, number one
subscribe, enjoy it, it's fantastic. They have a Patreon too I hear. Yes, all these
Patreons, I never seem to get any of the money, they always go to the other guy so
I've done something horribly wrong in my management. Podcasts, apart from the
normal ones that everybody knows all the tech ones. So I don't want to avoid those. I'm a Patreon of
another podcast. It's the Unmade podcast. That's probably fairly well known as well, because it's
got Brady Haran hosts that and he does a bunch of YouTube stuff and podcasts and used to be
Hello Internet with CGP Grey. He, this podcast started off as coming up with ideas for podcasts
that they're not actually going to do. So each week they have to, he and his co-host come up
with an idea of a show for a podcast, an idea for a podcast. And they talk about it and say
why it would make a good podcast. But as with any good show, over time it has morphed and created
its own culture and norms and segments and all that kind of stuff.
So the actual idea of coming up with a podcast idea is only probably one-fifth of the entire
show these days.
But it's just, it's really good banter between the two of them.
They have lots of engagement, huge audience from what I can tell.
It's just a really fun, enjoyable listen.
And Brady being ex-Australian now in the UK, and he's very good at these sort of things,
high quality editing. And then his mate that he grew up with in South Australia, so is a South
Australian church minister. And it's just a different kind of vibe you get from the other
co-host. He's not a techie dude, but he's, you know, a family man who is a minister of a church
and just has a totally different take on life. But they had this common heritage being friends
as kids. And so it makes like a really lovely and wholesome show. But it's um, it's a lot of fun. So
the Unmade podcast. I love how you exiled Brady from Australia. I don't know if that was on
purpose or not. But ex Australian. Like, he's out of here. You're either here or not. You're out.
Hey, man. Somehow he got like a some order of Australia medal. And I want to know I've been,
I've been lusting after one of those my entire life and he just gets one. He's not even here.
But that was the order out of Australia medal.
Other one I pay for, and it's really for kids. I've got it for our kids. It's like a Mr.
Rogers equivalent podcast. Mindfulness for kids. It's called Like You. It's quite wonderful if
you've got kids and you're trying to just, just younger children. We listen to it at night time.
They love it. It just talks about, you know, how do you cope with your emotions? How do you
get through a day? What if you have a hard time? There's some songs and talking. It's really
lovely. And it's gotten to the point now where we've been listening to it for so long that now
I find it soothing and calming. It's just like, ah, it takes me to a nice little comfortable
place, even though it's pitched at kids, you know, six to eight year olds, but it's fantastic. And
And the guy does a lot of work.
It's really well produced.
He does his own songs.
Does, you know, got a script each week.
Puts a lot of hard work into it.
So I recommend, like you.
Mindfulness for kids.
- But that's a good point, isn't it?
'Cause we all were once kids.
And I think sometimes as adults, even,
there's pressure to always just be an adult.
You can be silly or take time out
or just explore something
and be a little bit more childlike.
Not childish, but childlike.
All right, Jason, you can go next.
alphabetical by first initial, you know, it's nice to have a process. Okay, so Andrew did two, so I'm
gonna do one, two, three, four, five, seven. I'm gonna do seven. Strap yourselves in everyone.
I'm gonna enjoy this edit. Here's the key, I browse your notes to see what the heck is in it.
And I gotta say, notes in almost every podcast, severely lacking in what could be in these notes.
notes. Very piss poor job of notes across the board.
Yeah, but to be fair, the tech genre is generally the best or most attentive with notes. It's
not just a thing for us, I think it's-
Sometimes but they are also the worst offenders of, "And that'll be in the notes." And then
it's nowhere in the notes ever.
I hate that. I hate that.
Never. It's not in the notes at all. Killing me. Anyway, so the ones that I actually picked
had nothing to do with,
I don't think I have a single tech related podcast on here,
which is probably pretty good for, well, okay. One is kind of sorta,
but anyway, number one, welcome to Night Vale,
which is a fictional story driven episode to episode.
Uh,
think of it like a TV show almost,
but in podcast format of an ever evolving world that you are immersed into through
storytelling. It's amazing.
Like a radio play, but for podcasts.
Exactly. That's exactly right. And they do live shows, which we've gone to many.
Valerie and I have gone to many of these live shows. They are phenomenal.
All of the voice actors in this show are just, they're so good.
You, you, you gain this kind of, you don't know them, but you just,
you connect with them so well. So Welcome to Night Vale is great.
I'm going to skip around on my list a little bit,
because Welcome to Night Vale has universe around it of other shows.
So I did want to touch on Within the Wires, which is another show,
which is based on taped conversations around different fictional
time periods and events.
Alice Isn't Dead is sort of a science
fictiony storytelling thing.
I'm specifically being vague because much of what they're about.
you want to learn as you're going through the experience.
So I don't really want to dive in too deep on what they are,
but they're all within this welcome to Night Vale family. Um,
the other one is the most, the most tech related,
most tech related is, uh, darknet diaries,
which is a really good, uh,
show about delving into different areas around kind of
hacking and that culture and stories about maybe it's,
One week is about some crazy malware thing that happened or some hacker that
did this wild thing when they were 13 that ended up, you know,
ruining the government of X, Y, Z country.
So there's just a lot of really cool stories around that. Um,
and I am a patron of that one because there's,
historically they've done patron specials as well. So that's a good one.
And I will touch on off the hook,
which is another one that's been going on forever.
Branches off of 2600, the magazine hacker culture,
American history tellers is another one. It's a little hit and miss.
It depends on what the topic is.
They'll do seasons based on different events throughout spoiler American
history. So if you don't care about American history,
probably not super relevant,
but they dive in and they do it through this kind of voice actor narrative thing
where they tell the story with people from the time.
So it's kind of as if you're immersed into that.
So if it were, let's say about the civil war,
there would be characters that were in the civil war being voice acted through
that narrative, which is nice.
And then the last one that I just want to add is ologies,
which is a show that every episode is about a different ology.
So it's like psychology is this episode and they bring in, uh,
the host, she brings on experts in that field to talk about that field. And they go through
the history of that field, where it's at today, where they think it's going,
you know, what sucks about being in that field, what's awesome about being in that field.
But the message is every episode is about a particular ology.
Yeah. There's a podcast that I've mentioned before, which isn't really my main one or
the focus. It's called The Cinematologist. So if anyone's ever into movies, Cinematologist,
really, really good. It's a show all about cinema, hopefully pretty self-explanatory, but they also
have a decent set of bonus content on their own Patreon. And they do a really nice newsletter as
well, which is very reflective or personal about things that they're experiencing written in the
first person. So I like that. I like it when, because they're actually academic writers,
but they kind of pour all of their personal experiences into this accompanying newsletter,
if you're into that kind of whole film exploration thing. But my actual thing, I thought I would
crowdsource this because a lot of the things I listened to are very tech white male and all that.
So I thought, who could I ask? And of course, there is a woman who lives in my house called
Natasha. She is my wife. And I thought, I'll ask her. She is. She is a woman. And she had a
suggestion. So I thought, I'm gonna offer that on the show. And she had a great suggestion,
which she has actually shown me. And I can attest to this. It's a great one. It's actually from the
ABC or the Australian Broadcasting Corporation hosted by Mark Finnell. But the show itself,
the podcast is called Stuff the British Stole. It's a fantastic show. It's historical. I hope
you get that vibe. And the whole idea is in each episode, they take a particular artifact or thing
from history, which was scooped up, more or less, and stolen by the British Empire or Commonwealth
and moved to a museum and minorities or the people who originally owned or the traditional
owners of this stuff are trying to reclaim or bring back to their native lands. And it's a
fascinating program just showing how people think that the British Empire or similar empires or
institutions are a thing of the past. Well, actually, they're not. The ramifications of
that stuff are ongoing. And a great example, without spoiling the entire story, was one of
the episodes was about a thing called the Benin Bronzes from the kingdom of Benin or Benin,
which is now modern day Nigeria. And the Brits moved in, scooped this stuff up, and now it lives
in the British Museum. And people are saying, well, can we have our stuff back? And they're
going, no, no, no, we are holding on to this because it requires historical maintenance and
promotion. And this is our stuff now. So that's a simplification. That's an oversimplified version.
but then there are other interesting arguments that come up about, well, in certain cases,
had it not been stolen, would the local owners have treated it with such reverence and sacred
respect and historical care, or would it have just been weathered somewhere on a temple?
So it's interesting. I don't want to say the British did the right thing, but it can be quite
complicated in some circumstances. So if you live in a place that is post-colonial or was under the
the rule of an empire or maybe you are based within said old imperial capital.
Listen to this show and see what you think.
Whenever I see a worm, I just start thinking, "They call me Dr. Worm.
Good morning, how are you?
I'm interested in things."
You know that song?
That really annoying song?
"I'm not a real doctor, but I am a real actual worm.
I am.
I like to play the drums."
Can I be honest with you?
I reckon, and I'm not saying this facetiously, one of my favorite things about the growth
in development of this podcast, like you said, Andrew, with the segments that have come out
of Unmade, is your propensity to start singing to explain things.
I know, and I'm not even a singer. I'm terrible at it. I don't like doing it.
No, don't put yourself down. You have your own kind of ethereal quality.
Never would have imagined myself fulfilling that role, but here we are.
