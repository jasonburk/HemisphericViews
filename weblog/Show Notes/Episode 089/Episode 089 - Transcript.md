[Music]
So what's up?
Yeah, we actually had a great morning.
We took Mac to the Discovery Space at the uni.
And just-
What is that? Is that like a science center?
There are elements of that.
It's like a- it's called Early Start.
So it's just devoted to kids' education.
but with this focus on like early learning,
it's really, really nice.
- Specifically for kids.
- Yeah, like you can take older kids there,
but you can take younger kids there
and they just have all these things to kind of explore.
Like there's a mock building site,
there's a pretend wooden ship with penguin figurines
around it like you're in Antarctica.
So it's really cool.
But I knew that we had this recording today
'cause we're recording earlier than usual
and we went, "Oh, he woke up late.
"How's this gonna work?
"I'm gonna have to tell Jason."
Whoops, I'm not gonna be on time,
but we absolutely tied him out.
He had the best time and here I am.
So how about you?
I can see you're rocking some longer facial hair than usual.
It's quite a cool Bushranger look.
- That's the second time I've heard that today.
I will be trimming that tomorrow and taking care of that.
Don't worry.
So don't be alarmed.
I was in the woods recently, so that's my excuse.
- All right, yeah, I saw some photos.
What was the story?
- I went to the woods and then just the beard
just like expanded just because I think
could sense the trees and the nature and it was just like here you go so
your testosterone just exploded you walked among trees and you were just
like instant man instant yeah that that's what brought me to work it took
for almost 41 years but here I am yeah I have arrived congratulations I wanted to
say though now that Mac is getting on in his his old age hmm I think you need to
go back to California now and go to the Exploratorium
because I think that would be just,
for me as a kid and as an adult alike,
like that place was just the best.
- Well, Natasha and I visited as adults.
Like, well, I mean, that's how we got there.
Yeah, you're talking about the places at San Francisco
with like on the water or whatever?
- Yep, totally.
- Loved it, absolutely loved it.
And I think I bought a couple of books there.
- It was so good.
- Yeah, there's a book I'm looking at right now
on my bookshelf called "Bird Love"
And I was like, "Oh, who's this awesome American photographer?
Oh, wait, it's an Australian photographer.
I'm buying an Australian book in the US."
- Perfect, so you flew to the US
to buy a book from an Australian photographer.
- And then put it in my luggage to return, yeah.
- And then brought it back, yeah.
So that's good.
It's good to get a book that is from right down the street
after you travel halfway around the world.
- But no, it's a good recommendation.
We should take him there if we get back in the future.
I absolutely loved it.
It was great.
Every time I've ever been there in my whole life, it's just been so cool.
So many cool, like it's very hands on and tactile, like everything you get to touch and mess with and understand how it's working instead of just like a normal museum where it's like, don't touch hands off, like stand 40 feet back.
This is just get in there and like touch it, ruin it, do whatever you want to do.
It's just really, it's a really cool place.
- Well, you've reminded me as a kid,
I used to go to the science centre quite a bit
and my grandfather used to take me as well,
few different family members,
but it was this really small kind of,
what would you call it?
I think it was something else.
I don't know if it was like a greenhouse
or some sort of hanger thing before,
but it was kind of like,
it was almost like a hemispheric shape.
It was like a dome, but long,
in a kind of long rectangular.
Is there a particular term for that?
I think I'm just making it up.
You can imagine like a dome from the front,
then it extends like a prism.
What's the technical mathematical term for that?
- A long sphere.
- Yeah, one of those.
But then it moved into this bigger thing
and they renamed it the science space,
but I loved that as a kid.
And they had, like you drop the balls down
and understand how physics worked,
things spinning around and they did the,
is it a spirograph?
Is that what it is?
When they have it kind of a pen on the string,
doing the loops and that's what they do on money and stuff.
- Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Or like the, did you ever do the plastic ones
where it's like the rings that you put like a ring
in a ring and then put the pen in it
and it does like all the crazy, yeah, totally.
- Loved that.
And they had the, and then I think when they upgraded
they have the planetarium there
and I'm a sucker for that stuff.
If I can look up and hear a very soothing voice
tell me about how small I am in the scheme of the universe,
that's great.
- Totally, yeah.
My two absolute favorite things
are probably the most simple.
And that's the first one is there's two like half domes
that you sit in across from each other,
way across from each other,
and basically barely speak.
And because of the way the parabolic cone thing happens,
you're just like, you're right next to each other.
That one's great.
And then the one where it's like a coil of copper
that's hot and one that's cold,
but you basically can't ever tell the difference
between what the hell is what.
I just like, it's so simple, but so,
just one of those like brain explode kind of things
when you first do it.
- I like when you touch both of them
and your brain's confused, is that what you mean?
Yeah. - Yeah, it's like,
which one's hot, which one's cold?
I literally, maybe it's left, maybe it's right.
I really don't know,
because they just, your body like can't understand.
It's so cool, I love that.
- That's great.
You're just bringing back all these childhood memories now
and now I wanna go back there.
- Yeah, absolutely, yeah.
There's just so many, like that place taught me so many,
there was so many things there that taught me
like explore further like okay, here's the thing presented to you, but like go
figure out why it made you want to know the why verse just here's a thing and
then you move on like other places where it's like here's a painting that's
great.
It's like, okay, cool.
That was a painting, but this was like, wait, why the hell is that the way it
is?
I want to know why that thing is so weird.
Help me understand that.
So that was, if anybody's in the Bay area in California, in the United States
ever go to the Exploratorium.
It's great.
not a sponsor, but it's great.
- Yeah, and if you're in Wollongong,
visit the Science Space at the UAW Innovation Campus
and their Early Start Discovery Space for Kids
at the main campus.
So also not a sponsor.
- I will go there as an adult
the next time I am in the GONG.
- But good point here, 'cause you made me think of it.
I was never a big fan of maths at high school
outside of the most practical things like numeracy,
geometry, and things like interest
or things that might have to do with finance.
You're like, okay, good, I've got my life skills, thank you.
I was never much of a surd or exponential fan or,
oh, you know, give me quadratics or something.
No, thank you.
But if they had taught mathematics with things like this,
just some, even just practical kind of scientific experiments
brought into the maths classroom,
I think I would have enjoyed maths a whole lot more
because you feel like a hypocrite going,
oh, maths is boring.
And then you go to the science space or Exploratorium,
which yes, it's science, but it's based on mathematics.
And you're like, oh, this is awesome.
I love it.
I want to do it in the classroom.
Yeah, it's not just pen and paper.
It's practical experience, which I think for me especially is like,
that's the way I want to learn is practical experience,
not just book and paper.
So yeah, get out there Exploratorium or just look,
do an internet search for like science museum in your area.
And I bet there's probably one like fairly close.
Well, I'm really keen to see what Mac does in future because
I've kind of been trying not so subtly
to get him into things like the planets and science.
So whenever it's like the aerial Apple TV screensavers
that come up or I put a globe in his room,
I'm always highlighting things like Earth, sun and moon.
And now the moment something comes up
and I don't happen to be in the room,
like Natasha's told me, he just goes, "Oh, dad."
Like, where's dad?
I need to tell him right now that the Earth is here.
- I need to inform him that this is Earth.
- It's like you're standing on it.
I don't know if he gets that quite yet.
He's a bit too young, but it's like,
- Well, in time, in time.
- Yeah. - Yeah, he'll get there.
(laughing)
- So we're about seven or eight minutes in.
Should we address the elephant in the room?
- Elephant in the room, yeah.
Generally, so if anyone is new here,
if this is your first episode, well, welcome.
But this is not usually how it goes.
Turns out there's actually usually three of us here.
We've got one. So last episode, if you were there,
you remember we did a vote at the end if we should continue the show.
I said yes. Martin said yes.
Andrew took a really long time to answer.
So we sort of just took it as a no and decided, well,
I guess it's just two people now. That's completely a lie. That is not the truth.
Andrew just had some other things he had to do.
So he will be here in spirit.
He will also have a segment,
but also probably most importantly,
because I don't want people to feel like Andrew's not here
or like feel uncomfortable,
I have also took it upon myself to bring 10 facts
about business and Australian basketball.
- Oh, wow.
- So that people feel comfortable that he's still here,
If that's okay.
So which should we do first?
Should we cut to his segment, which honestly, we don't know what he's going to say.
It's probably something really, really important and insightful from a business perspective.
I would imagine.
Do you want to do your facts first?
What do you reckon?
I figure I would just kind of sprinkle them throughout.
So it feels like there's just sort of always three people's perspectives here.
But we can cut to his segment now.
I think that would be fine.
And then we'll come back from that in a bit.
All right. Fingers crossed.
it is normal for our first time listeners.
>> We hope. Now I've just noticed that he's actually in
the waiting room for this call.
>> Is he?
>> I don't know if he's doing it live.
If he's doing a remote segment live,
I guess I'll let him in.
>> All right.
>> I'm not sure.
Here we go.
Or it's an imposter, we're not sure.
Let's see. Here we go. Admit.
Hello, caller?
>> Hello.
>> Caller?
>> We can see he's-
- You're on the air.
- Icon, his avatar.
- Color, that's not looking good.
Okay, well, because we thought he was gonna be here
after his segment live, but he's not,
I think I'll bring out my first business/Australian
basketball fact, if that's okay.
- Please, I'm dying to hear it.
- So we're gonna go with number one,
are netball and basketball the same thing?
The answer is no.
Really? Wow. I mean, they both have little nets. It's surprising.
Turns out they're not the same somehow. I did no further research, so I couldn't tell you why,
but the answer apparently is no.
See, I thought with the basketball business crossover, you were going to say that netball
is actually a reference to net versus gross. So it's really just a financial ball game.
Ooh, a financial ball game. That's exciting.
Sounds like Andrew's having fun.
Can I just cut in there? Can I just cut in there?
Are you there?
Yeah, yeah. I hear this has become a call-in show now based on the last episode where
you can, listeners can just feedback directly.
Yep.
Yep. I'm hoping to just quickly do that now.
Yeah, please do.
I'm in the middle of moving furniture. So I hope you don't mind,
but I just heard that basketball financial cross-reference and I just had to start.
Would you believe, you wouldn't believe this. This is uncanny. I'm literally carrying a
wicker basket at the moment. And you talk about basket ball. Well, I've got the basket.
I just need the ball. I'm no joke. In one hand, I have my wicker basket.
This is incredible. I'm talking about, you're talking about baskets, balls, finance. I heard
you say something about nets. Yes. That's all I got. That's all I got. Okay. Is this one of those
radio things where we have to come up with some excuse for the news is about to start and we have
to boot the caller off? Oh, right. Yeah, we're actually moving into the next, we have a big
big announcement we need to move into. So thank you, caller. We appreciate the input.
Please keep listening to hear more business and or Australian basketball facts.
Okay. And just before I go and get back to my moving shirt, can I just remind everybody
who is listening, Canyon.blog/save.
Ah, perfect.
Where you can get all of your wicker basket needs.
Yeah. Love personal plugs on the show.
Is there any other thing you'd like to plug that maybe people could give a small amount
of money to?
Yes, there is.
OnePrintPlus.com.
Ah, there it is.
Love it.
Thank you.
Thank you, loyal listener.
It's a pleasure.
I'm sorry, I can't talk to you longer, but the furniture awaits.
Good luck with the move.
Watch your back.
Au revoir.
I love when people call in when they're doing just normal day to day tasks.
That's great.
That he kept his his radio off in the background his internet radio or whatever streamers podcast. I don't know what we do
No feedback. Yeah, but now that we've heard that
Caller who sounded very much like Andrew should we now go to a weird right? It's very strange
You think they were related somehow maybe maybe those canyons are a bit strange basically all of Western Australia
You just don't know what's going on over there. Yeah, it sounded pretty like the way they were speaking
It sounded like they were wearing high-vis. So it was probably WA I would imagine. Yeah
All right, so let's hear from the real Andrew
Hello hemispherians
Hello, Jason. Hello Martin
This is Andrew coming to you from an unknown place
at an unknown time
But to be placed into a known episode of hemispheric views
So yes, sometimes we do this we have our little individual pieces Martin did his from New Zealand
I'm doing mine from somewhere not so glamorous
First of all, I want to follow up. There is always follow-up in podcasts. It seems and I have a piece today
But this follow-up is really for Jason. You may recall in an earlier episode
we talked about
wearing Ugg boots and
Jason was horrified that I wore Ugg boots without socks
This morning I tried Jason's method again. I had my socks on I had an hour or so to get ready for work
I didn't want to put my boots on yet. So I went with the Ugg boots
Over the socks it did not go well
I do not understand what Jason's on about
So what happened is that after about 15 minutes of Ugg boot sock wearing?
Just wandering around the house. Nothing exuberant. Just walking around the kitchen making breakfast getting myself ready that kind of thing
my socks had
Slipped off my feet and were bundling up in my boot
So they had slid off my foot
I ended up with a big socky bundle with my toes would be and
They're all twisted and gross and I just don't understand how you can wear socks with ugly boots
I don't know if Jason has some super tight fitting sports sock that he wears
Probably it's dedicated purely for Ugg boot use the way he goes
But for me the sock Ugg boot test is a massive failure
The other thing I want to talk about while I have you all to myself
is
Something that I might call an app hack app hack corner
Yes, App Hack.
There are so many apps to track TV watching and they're all good in their own way, but
they're all overkill.
And I thought to myself the other day when I wanted to start tracking my shows, there
must be an easier way of doing this.
I suddenly realized I am a premium subscriber to Anylist.
Anylist is my grocery list app of choice.
list app, recipe manager, that whole thing. Everybody talks about paprika. I don't know
why paprika has such a mind share win in the market. For me, I'm an any list customer,
have been for years. I love it. And I've used any list occasionally for other lists, not
just groceries. I've used it for pack lists. I've used it for presents for the kids that
the kids might not like. I've used it for presents that I might like. I've used it for
things that I need to buy at Bunnings. There are all sorts of things any list
can do and I suddenly realized the other day why couldn't any list be my TV show
tracker. So I set it up TV in progress and I've got to say reports so far are
pretty good. I just want to talk you through what I've done here because
others might be interested others might not. If you're not I'm sorry it's nerdy
Okay, what can I do? I just go on these tangents sometimes anyway each TV show that you're watching becomes an item in your list
right so at the moment for instance the two in my list because I've watched a few shows recently and
Culled my list by getting through the episodes, but the ones that I'm watching at the moment are platonic on Apple TV and the bear
Well, I'm not watching the bear yet because those in America have season two
Those of us in the southern hemisphere in Australia are still waiting for its release, but never mind. It's on my list ready to watch
so what I do is
The item on my list is the TV series
So platonic the next thing you can do you can set a specific store in any list
Now the store becomes my channel
so
The store for platonic is Apple TV Plus
for other shows that might be Netflix or Disney plus or
Stan that we have here in Australia
so the store is the service and
Finally, and this is the thing that I think is kind of cute
How do you track what episode you're up to?
Well any list allows you to set a quantity of items that you might want to buy
So all I need to do is each time I watch an episode is
Increment my item by one. I'm not checking it off the list. I'm just incrementing the item so I can see here
I've got platonic
Nine as you know, I want to buy nine of them, but I don't really want to buy nine. I just want to watch
episode nine
There's also a notes field and there you can put in perhaps the season if you wanted to I started off putting the season
And the episode number in that note until I realized the quantity hack so you can do that
So when you finish the series or you finish the show you've given up on it you you're bailing out whatever it might be
Then you can cross it off. You can check it as
Purchased in any list and basically it puts a line through it takes off your list
But it can maintain a history so you can go back and view all the shows that you have watched that are crossed off
your list
So there you go
Any list as a TV show episode watch manager service.
You're just not going to get these kind of tips from any other podcast.
So there you go.
My two contributions to this podcast from afar.
Ugg boot follow up.
Any list as a TV show manager.
Now, it's back to the show.
I don't know what we just heard, but it was pretty special.
It kind of sounded like the same person. I don't know.
I'm a little bit terrified. I'm going to get random call-ins now from people who sound like Andrew.
All of the Andrew Canyons of the world will call in. Um,
so thank you, Andrew, for your segment on boop.
It was very boop.
I know that first time listeners are going to be very,
very confused by what's happening. And I think it's great.
So confused. This is probably when people ask like,
what's the first episode I should listen to?
Probably not this one. I would think this could be very jarring. We also have to decide what on earth we're gonna do because
loyal listener David H suggested that given our odd numbering starting with pilot zero and our recent
87 a and 87 to leading to 88 this would make this episode in fact
Episode 91 if you were to count all the individual installments of the regular feed rather than 18
Yeah, so who knows right the time this goes out this could be 89 91 or a totally made-up number
Do it do we just skip to letters? Is this just like a
C D
Maybe well my my thought as a homage to you know
Apple history given that we generally kind of bond over that whole thing is there was no iPhone 9 was there it's true
So that would make this
Not 90 9 like you're kind of skipping 90 do we want to do that? I don't know
Do we do n ot 90 I kind of what episode is this now?
I was supposed to be 89 this is a denied confused technically. This is 89
We know what are we doing? But I mean there's technical and then there's reality so it's either 89
91
90 or
143 that's a nice number. Yeah, so we could just skip
The sooner we get to a hundred, the faster I will be redeemed that I started it with three digits being zero, zero, zero.
So that when we get to a hundred, if you look at all the episode numbers in a column, they all line up nicely because they're all still three digits.
That was the goal.
So what you're saying is we should skip to episode 1000.
No, no.
This won't go to a thousand.
No, no, this will regardless of how long this goes 999 will be the absolute last episode no matter what.
Or do we just claim some sort of Y2K-esque problem and at the moment that we think it's going to tick over to 1000 it actually resets to 0 so you never have to have 4 digits.
I wonder if the system would allow us to do 000 again.
Well, you just type it in like, you know where you select the title you just choose and this is for people listening who have
No idea what I'm talking about when we select the episode titles you can choose the type of drop-down
Kind of drop-down title format that you want and rather than choosing the numbered one
You just go my great title and then you just type in whatever you want. Oh, it's like when I started doing Mac OS 10 point
10 and so on whatever does it's not one. It's 10 we could start point systems
we could just say this is 88.1. Yeah. With every subsequent release, we go up by that decimal.
Just never go past 88. Why not? Anyway, listeners, you'll find out what the hell we decide.
I don't know what's going on. But I think that we should get to the news that everyone wants to hear
and that you have taken on as a responsibility, Jason, as a burden, yet again, on an annual basis,
you are responsible for the Arcadia June leaderboard. What can you tell us about 2023?
So this has been an interesting year. I will say there is a spreadsheet. So Andrew is
Singing to the rooftops probably right now as he probably is hearing this that there is a spreadsheet
But there is it's not sorry. It's not an Excel. It's in numbers because it looks better. It's way better. Yeah, so
Okay, Arcadia June. This is the third year that we've done this now
It's been a blast every year
Everybody gets together. They play the games. We got a couple extra games this year and then we do a
Round up of all the scores. We do a
Very sophisticated algorithm to figure out who is in first place second place third place, etc
So for this year
2023 Arcadia June we had
Extra games and we had I believe more players than before. So that's great. Love to see that
and
Unfortunately or fortunately, we've got kind of a problem. Yeah, we have a certain individual
That won the first year
Good for them. That's great. Congratulations to be a good win right out of the gate
Second year comes around. Oh
Interesting. They won. They won again the second year. Hmm. Okay. Well, you know, it's it's random
You know people are all trying it's it's difficult, but but they won again. So that's good for them
So the third year we're like, okay, this is the year somebody's gonna dethrone the the winner
Yeah, it didn't happen
Three years in a row
Eric is the winner again
Row of Arcadia June and not only that by like a wide wide margin
It's terrifying. He's winning every year. He's getting better every year, which is very
very concerning so
this year's Arcadia June 2023 winner is
surprise surprise
Eric again. Congratulations, Eric. Oh
Good job, Eric on winning
again for the third year
His family is probably getting annoyed that he has a whole separate room of his house now just for Arcadia June trophies
So sorry about that, but really that's on him for winning so much
So that's first place
second place
You know this person pretty well. I think I do. Yeah. Yeah, you know them pretty well
this would be
none other than
Tashkent
second place
Fantastic. Good job. Congratulations third place now
Third place Arcadia June 2023 Andrew will be excited about this is mate
Furstenberg
Congratulations and interestingly well done. They swapped since last year
So it's yeah, but there was a bit of a tussle and a little bit of a little bit of infighting there
Yeah, there was some some and I
Noticed at the end there Eric came back and really started posting some scores at the end because I think he was concerned. So
Yeah, that's top three and then top so if we just kind of go down the list, so we've got Eric
We've got Natasha. We got first number. We got Nick Patrick by Valerie Rob. Hey, Scotty J Alpine
Phil Stollery and
Laker are the the roundout of the the top
top players for Arcadia June this year and we usually do some kind of shout outs for like
exceptional stuff
So this year also, you know, like just put everything on repeat. It seems like
We've got a Bricko score. Mm-hmm again from Natasha, but I think last year she was like
80 some thousand or something like that. I think I've got it here
I'm Katie a June 2022 top Bricko score - can on sixty three thousand six hundred and sixty three thousand
Yeah, yeah, very good score. Yeah, obviously
So this year she was like, well, you know, that was all right, I guess
What about if this year I do I don't know
226,000 points she's for
2023 so
It was obvious early on that
No one even wanted to touch this game because she was the only one in the category for like weeks
until people finally started putting scores in but
It's pretty safe to say like don't even bother in this game because like she's got it. So just accept it
Acknowledge that she's the best and move on
the next one would be bubble mania is
actually
Valerie had the highest score this year of thirty six thousand nine eighty five for bubble mania and then the third
Special shout out is not about a specific game
It actually goes back to the person that got first place in that they got out of the 21
Individual games that are available. They got first place in
14 of them Wow two-thirds of the overall games were first place
by Eric, so I don't know if we need to ban him or
Give him a lifetime achievement award and just say he's not allowed to play anymore or what but he clearly came out
Gun in for first place and he got it. So congratulations everybody that played it was great
I'm super excited whenever we do this because it's fun to just
Play some games that are quick and have a little bit of competitiveness in a fun way
So thanks everybody for playing Arcadia June
There will be Arcadia June 2024
Obviously, we'll see if we decide to ban Eric or not.
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
We'll have to take kind of a judge's ruling on that.
But as of right now, he's the one to beat three years in a row.
So that's the goal is to beat Eric in 2024.
Yeah, he is undisputed champion and impressive scores from everyone else.
So thank you for taking part, just like Jason said.
And Jason, thank you for going to the effort again of compiling all of these scores to
make the leaderboard.
And listeners, if you want to see the full breakdown, all the different rankings, the
scores that Jason's talking about, visit the links and show notes for this episode.
And you will see in the list there a blog post that includes what we're talking about.
And if you have suggestions for next year, whether it's for toppling Eric, expanding
the competition, shaking it up a bit, whatever you like.
Otherwise, congratulations, Eric, winner of Arcadia June 2024.
Amazing.
Oh, okay. I think you've put this in here. Which one? The windows thing. I did not put
that in there. Oh, did Andrew do that? He may have. So we talked about windows last
time. Yeah, we did. And we were very accommodating to windows, I felt. Could be argued otherwise.
But we in the discord, I think we had some, some chit chat. I believe it was Andrew that
that posed this question as to what was kind of better
or what did, or maybe it was just in the show talk
because people were responding to our comments.
But we had some feedback about Windows in general
and some things that people felt were better
about Windows than Mac OS, which great.
- It is possible.
- It's not a competition, but here we go.
- All subjective.
- So Rob wrote in about Windows snapping,
which I thought was interesting.
I never even, that didn't even occur to me
because I don't ever do that personally.
So there you go, Windows Snapping built right in.
So if you're into that, great.
- I will say something on that.
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah, with Windows Snapping,
I feel it's one area where maybe the Mac does fall over
a bit as an option for interface arrangement or something.
I mean, generally I prefer the Mac like you do Jason
for just about everything user interface,
but there are so many different ways
of actually arranging Windows and navigating them,
but the snapping does feel like a bit of an obvious thing
that could be there if you want it.
I use Magnet and I think it's great, not all the time,
but I can tell you that for show notes,
particularly when I do stuff like really specific stories,
if anyone's listened to that, I arrange the transcript,
my IA writer window and my browser in these perfect thirds.
And it's this beautiful optimal experience
for lining everything up to make sure that I'm linking
what's in any given research episode.
So I think maybe this is an area
where Windows has an edge over Mac.
I don't really have any experience in using it.
So the snapping tool on Windows might actually be crap,
but I wouldn't mind if Mac included
something like Magnet or Apple actually just bought the app
and integrated it or something.
So opportunity for improvement as far as I'm concerned.
- And that was really specific stories at rsspod.net.
Is that the one you're referring to?
- That's the one, yes.
- That's the one.
I just wanted to make sure that we were clear on that. Thank you. I do think it's interesting that there's this like
Not necessarily what could be done with each operating system
But like what is built in is sort of the discussion like what is it out of the box verse like what?
Could you get for it? I think that's not it
that's like an interesting distinction because you could say like
You know take all the operating systems and allow like every third-party option available
And that's like a different discussion than like just out of the box. What do you get?
And I think that that is it's an important distinction because you've you assume
Most kind of people that are coming to a computer are not into like all this extra crap
They're just sort of like what does it do for me?
Yeah
So that is that is kind of powerful to have certain things available
Right out of the box verse having to go and find
Those things because the third-party ones
Maybe you know equal better or whatever, but you have to go know to find them
So yeah
It is sort of an interesting distinction and the magnet example has a really good
Little menu bar item that shows you all the shortcuts or little graphical
representations of where your windows will end up because the problem of
Introducing something like window snapping I think whether it's Windows or Mac
I think you actually do end up with some human user interface problems because like on the iPad
like I'm a fan of things like slide over split view stage manager and so on there, but
Increasingly those things are becoming kind of invisible or users have to stumble into them
So I can imagine that if Apple did bring in something and have it out of the box
It probably wouldn't be the perfect user interface experience because they would try to hide it or you'd have to hover or it's not obvious
so it could actually end up being
difficult to discover.
So I think that's another thing to balance,
discovery and usability.
- Gotcha, yeah, I could see that for sure.
Quickly, I just wanna throw in that capabilities,
capacity, constraints and culture
are the four Cs of business.
- Oh.
- Just to throw that in there real quick,
so everybody's aware.
The next Windows feedback we had was from Furstenberg.
- Firsty.
I don't use multi monitors so that would not be a thing I would notice.
Have you noticed anything with multi monitors on the Mac?
We're talking about like second and third displays.
I assume so.
I think, yeah, look, I'm not a huge fan personally of using multiple monitors.
I don't like things that are offset or diagonal.
That's just more of an ergonomic thing, you know, to be fussy.
I think the Mac handles it pretty well and has increasingly done a better job of it.
You know, particularly now with things like iPads with that universal control, I think
that's improved, but maybe there is something about Windows having an edge over it.
I'm not sure.
Maybe Macs are a little bit more difficult because of very specific Apple-blessed resolution
settings or something, but my personal experience is that it's been okay when I've had to use
it.
All right.
And then we've got Phil on Mastodon.
I don't know if you've heard of Mastodon.
It's a new up and comer.
manipulation I'm not quite sure we're talking about resizing and moving around. I'm wondering if that's related to like snapping or
I feel like Andrew's gonna be a little bit cross with us because he put this in here. We just got
Yeah
Yeah, he read everything about this and we have no idea. So I'm gonna assume he will have follow-up on this
It'll be far for the follow-up follow-up follow-up and then David H came in with right-click
Features, so I think what he likes is probably right-click saved a briefcase is what I'm assuming is probably what he's talking about
Oh, yeah, you gotta take your briefcase. Seriously. It's gotta be right like where else you gonna put it briefcase
Has to be yeah one thing I will say about window manipulation
I think with window manipulation
I
Again, I'm so used to using the Mac that you kind of have to step back and go
How much of it am I just used to and do I find easy because I've kind of grown or shifted with the system where a
Novice or someone coming in might actually find it difficult one thing. I want to know your thought on this
Increasingly with certain apps we're seeing
Reduced or less obvious
Toolbars or app Chrome. What do you think of that?
Is that I don't know if this is what Phil on Mastodon is talking about
But if we're talking about dragging windows around or knowing what's a handle versus a button or a grabable area
Do you see a regression in that area on the Mac at least in terms of what's obvious? I think
for the most part people have kept the
top bar
Fairly sacred in terms of you've got your three dots in the left and just a very clear bar
But I do think there has been this sort of move toward
removal of the the bar I guess in this like like how do we hide it or make it be more invisible or
or just delete it entirely.
And I do think that's sort of weird in a sense,
or we move the like three dots and everything
like as far to the top as possible.
So there's like two pixels between that and the top.
And I think it ruins consistency
and makes it confusing from a user perspective
of like Windows should be Windows
and then everything should be inside of that
versus you get to really manipulate the outside edges.
And so I think there has been a slide toward removal
of that sort of outer Chrome area.
And I don't think it's the best
because I do think that that leads to
why is this different than the other one?
They should all work the same.
And some windows, like it's hard to know,
where do I grab it?
Like how do I even move the window at all?
I think the worst offender for this
that I can think of is, funny enough, join our Discord.
The Discord app is sort of one of the worst offenders
of this because you can only grab the top in certain areas.
- It's horrible.
- Because other areas are menus or like buttons
or things that if those are covered by something,
like you have to move the other thing
before you can move the Discord window.
So there's only like maybe 30% in the middle
you can really grab reliably.
That's the example that comes to mind where I'm just like,
just let me grab the damn window and move it
and not have to like figure out where is grabbable.
- See, I totally agree with everything that you said.
I think some of this is Apple's fault
and some of it's not Apple's fault.
I think where you kind of see that it's Apple's fault
is in that kind of attempt to make things consistent
between the iPad and the Mac, for example.
And quite often they say, no, the systems will not merge.
They are their own distinct things
with their own distinct uses.
But then kind of full screen iPad app thinking
bleeds into a multi-window system like the Mac
and then elements are removed that really need to be there.
But then the third party kind of app fault, like you said,
the discords and slacks of the world
not really being good platform citizens.
But then you look at other app developers
And I actually think I brought this up
in that new Windows Corner channel
that I think Andrew put in the Discord.
Made me feel slightly sick for a second,
but I'll move on from that.
You know, you see the likes of Pixelmator Pro.
Again, none of these are sponsors.
We don't have them.
You've got Pixelmator Pro, Audio Hijack,
Ivory for Mastodon, MarsEdit, all these great apps.
And you can tell that the people who make them
get the spirit or the psyche of what the Mac user interface
was and what it's supposed to be. And they're delightful and they follow all the rules and
you never feel confused navigating those interfaces. So I don't know if we've kind of gone off on a
tangent here, but I think, Andrew, thank you for putting this in because it's prompted like,
what actually is working and maybe what's better or broken.
I would just reply to that, that basketball quickly took off in Australia in 1897,
just six years after it was invented in the United States by a guy named James.
And his surname was Basketball, right?
I think it must have been. I didn't really read too much further into it.
I kind of stopped after it said James.
In 1931, the Victoria Basketball Association spearheaded the growing expansion of the sport
of basketball in the country of Australia. So there's that.
So what you're saying is that Victoria is superior to Western Australia?
That's what I'm hearing. Yeah, that's the word on the basketball street. Yep.
Perfect. He's gonna love this episode. He might actually not come back. This may actually be,
in fact, the last time you ever hear from him. We'll see.
Do you reckon Andrew likes to collaborate courtside? Is that how he thinks?
I think so. I think courtside collaboration, because it's also sort of the CCE,
and then like canyon courtside collaboration is sort of his jam.
To achieve like a three-point pivot?
Three-point pivot. Yeah, absolutely. I could see that.
With a synergistic swoosh.
Ooh, look at that.
Thank you.
Love this. This is good.
The moment I get some validation just yeah, maybe we don't need him back. No, we need him back
I think we need him back. Yeah, the people the people want what the people want
He's also the elder of the podcast. You know, I mean, he is the elder
Yeah, he's got like a big cane and like in like a big hat with like white flowing hair
Is that him? Wait, am I thinking of someone else? I think you're
Gandalf dressed up as the Monopoly guy. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah
I kind of think of him as the Gandalf wearing the Monopoly outfit of the show.
Are we talking Gandalf the grey or Gandalf the white?
Like where in his kind of Dragon Ball Z or Pokemon Evolution phase are we going?
That's a good question.
He sort of encompasses like all simultaneously.
Like he has that kind of power.
Okay, I don't know if this makes any sense to you or if like,
because the age difference isn't that huge, but sometimes you miss these things.
Like, did you ever remember like the Animorphs?
Yes. Do you remember like the book covers that went along with like the TV series what the book
covers for anamorphs were like? I think so, yeah. And you'd see like this preteen or tweenie or
yeah I don't know but they're teenagers whatever they'd be like morphing into a frog or a goat or
a moose or a hawk or something. So Andrew is basically like a basketball Gandalf Monopoly guy
anamorph and we're seeing all 10 stages of his metamorphosis into that character. I think that's
- That's absolutely right.
Yeah, it's one of those like those lenticular pictures
where you're sort of just moving your head back and forth
and he's all things depending on the angle you're at.
Yeah. - Awesome.
- I love that. - And if you actually
hold it under a certain light,
there's like a numerical value aligning with a spreadsheet
that you can take to create a formula
to find the perfect basketball strategy for any given day
in one of his commentating sessions.
- I think that's, yeah.
It's, yeah.
I love that what I just said was such bullshit
that you didn't know how to address that.
(both laughing)
- Oh, this is great.
To round out the business facts,
one in 10 Europeans are conceived in an Ikea bed.
- Really?
You didn't just make that up?
- No, it's a business fact.
- When you say conceived in an Ikea bed,
are we saying people went to Ikea,
they were happy with the bed,
bought it, the bed frame was delivered,
and they assembled a flat pack at home
and then conceived the child,
or are they actually so desperate,
unable to get out of the store
and they're stranded within the maze that is IKEA
that they actually have to use the IKEA bed
to conceive the child and hope that they get out
after they've had their meatball meal?
- I read it as the latter,
where you're in an IKEA and you're so lost,
you're in there for enough time,
you know, nine months plus to where you're like,
"Well, we're here, I guess we live here now."
and now we have a child in an Ikea.
But fortunately, there's a children's bedroom
right over there that's all set up, so it's all good.
- Absolutely, and you head over to Coffica,
and if that's how you pronounce it, you get your pastries.
- Yeah, you get your pastries, you got your meatballs,
you got your Swedish pancakes.
- Nordic pear water.
- Pear water, yeah, it's got everything you need.
What else do you need?
You go downstairs if you wanna have some outdoor living.
You go upstairs if you wanna have more
of your like traditional housing, it works out.
- As long as they're cleaning the sheets.
- And they got those fake computers
that we have already talked about.
So you're set with that.
- So business, pleasure, sustenance, it's all in Ikea.
- Covered, brought to you by Ikea or Ikea.
- Ikea.
- There you go.
- All right, count us down.
- In three, two, one, stop.
