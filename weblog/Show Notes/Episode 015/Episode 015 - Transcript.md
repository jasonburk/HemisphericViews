Now I was just saying to Jason, Andrew, that I've hit a new level of comfort with both of you.
I'm wearing a singlet.
So I'm sorry about that.
And you've got your PJ shirt on, is that right?
I do. It's my Grinch pyjamas.
Oh, perfect.
I think you mean it's the you pyjamas.
Yeah, pretty much.
Is that the one that we saw on micro.blog with your breakfast preparation?
Yeah, it probably was good memory. I don't forget it was the picture left an impression on me
You were you were very boldly buttering right or something. That's right. Yes. I was yeah, I
Recall it clearly now. It's embarrassing because my wife started a new family tradition
And so she buys Christmas pajamas each year now, but she buys four sets of them
So we have me her and two kids all dressed in the same pajamas. That's charming surely
That's one way of putting it.
It's like an ad for Peter Alexander pajamas or something.
That's what these are.
Do they come in a four pack?
Or is that something you have to orchestrate yourself through the self-checkout process?
Yeah, you gotta do that yourself.
It's not like a bulk buy situation where you buy a family movie ticket.
That's a missed opportunity.
There should just be a bucket that comes with all the sizes you need and you're ready to
go. A pajama bucket. Yeah. That's a pajama bucket. That's an untapped business opportunity.
Oh Jason, your drink, just that you've reminded me, I've taken a leaf out of your book and I've
come prepared with a multi beverage experience. Oh good. We've got the Milo, which I'm drinking
first, which may be risky for a podcast considering that milk may not be optimum for the throat.
Is it cold? Wait, what is that? It's cold. Yeah. Milo. Are you familiar with Milo? Nestle Milo?
No, no, what is that? Do tell. It's a gritty, malty chalk powder which should mix into milk
but doesn't properly because apparently the inventor was told by his children that it's
nice when it's coarse. You get this little grainy slick on top of the milk which is just perfect.
What do you reckon Andrew? Do you like it that way or do you mix it in with hot milk?
No, I like mix it with cold milk and then you whip it up so it goes it gets milky like the malty
The chocolate malt sort of mixes in with the milk, but then yeah, it's still like a sludge that forms on the top of the milk.
And then you just spoon that off and eat it.
Exactly.
And then you drink the chocolate flavored milk after that.
We're on opposite sides of the continent, but we're aligned.
Wow.
In the most perfect sense.
Okay.
That's, I mean, if the way you like it is the way it was not intended, that's all the better.
It's so delicious.
I don't think I've ever met a person who doesn't like Milo.
Yeah, it's not like veggie bite. It's a chocolatey thing. You're gonna like it.
Yeah.
So no thin layers here. We want thick, just sludge.
Yeah, you can't overload Milo into milk. It doesn't matter how much. You will just take it.
Milo is one of those things you can eat it straight out of the jar. Or tin. I should call it a tin.
My Milo to milk ratio as a teenager was criminal.
Keeping it speedy, number two I have the Cottie's Lime Cooler Cordial in pure green.
I didn't realize doing a podcast with a seven-year-old.
This is why I brought it up.
We had German visitors from when I went on exchange and they saw me drinking this and said,
"Martin, why are you drinking palm olive?"
And I said, "It's not palm olive. It's an Australian staple."
Followed by just fizzy water, because I feel that's a podcast staple.
So I just want to say thank you, Jason, for inspiring me.
Is that the green thing?
Was the liquid green or was the cup green? I couldn't...
Both and I did that deliberately just to...
To really hype up the green. Yeah that's... that is... wow that's radioactive looking. I love it.
Anyway you're right Andrew. I turn eight next week so thanks for having me on.
I'm just worried about the combination of Milo milk and cordial. It's like wow.
It's an experiment. I'm gonna go to cordial now.
Oh Jesus.
Oh god I made that a bit strong.
[laughs]
[music]
Well, we've got origin stories there and I think I've distracted enough, so Jason, you
entered this. Do you want to kick it off? Explain what this is all about?
I would love to explain what it's about. I don't even really fully know, to be perfectly
honest. It kind of was just something where I was thinking, "Where did we get to where
we're at now. Almost like a superhero but obviously less super, probably less hero,
and more focused more around nothing that's us but more about the things that
we've used. So that seems pretty straightforward. I don't know if anybody
didn't get that. You shouldn't talk yourself down. Come on, you're super.
Then it snowballed and then Andrew sends this beautiful like graphic of his life
in technology and I feel horrible because I haven't even written anything
down in terms of text I was gonna kind of just wing it so then I had to break
out Graffle last night and start building something that looked somewhat
respectable and I came up with something and then I think Martin you followed
suit but yours was even prettier than mine also what with the handwriting was
that actually handwriting yes that's Apple pencil yeah man that's beautiful
Beautiful handwriting. It looked like a font. Thank you very much. Natasha tells
me I have doctor's handwriting so you two have really given me a boost. Thank
you. Wow. No, not at all. You need to go back to med school because it looked
great. Thank you very much. Well I suppose we'll be including these in the show
notes. Maybe no one cares and if not then that's why we have chapters. You just
skip right past this part. Well this is fascinating. I love knowing people's
history in technology, like where they came from. It's kind of the origin of
this podcast itself in a way, because when Martin and I had our chat over on
Lounge Ruminator, we ended up talking about old computers and it was
fun. That was a blast. I'm more interested in your histories than mine. I know mine.
Right. Well Andrew, since you added yours first, do you want to run us through
your thought process? Because what I find really interesting about each of these
graphics is that not only does it say something about our histories or what
we've liked or used but it also shows the way that we think a little bit how
different we are because all three are presented quite differently. Yes. Which I
feel is quite deliberate. Yeah I think just look looking at the graphic alone
I think says almost more than what's in the graphic. If only I could have made
this into a spreadsheet. I'm sure you can. Yes I'll kick off with mine. This is
actually a bit of a confession this is not a new document it's one that I had
built a while ago I don't even know why I do it I think I did it just to play
with OmniGraffle and I needed some purpose something to make with it and so
I came up with this concept but it served me well essentially it's a
timeline of my computer and console ownership dating back to the first one
in 1984 showing my age so I was like seven years old then right through it it
goes to 2014 so it needs a bit of an update but I think I've captured
everything certainly everything I could remember so who knows if there's a
little bit of extra stuff thrown in there but these are the main ones that
certainly stick in my mind and I think it all starts back with the Atari 2600
that was the games machine I remember playing Superman to the point where I
could clock that I remember playing Keystone Cops I remember playing Pitfall
They were all awesome games and it set me up for sort of technology in my life
forevermore. I'll draw out just a few highlights perhaps. The Dick Smith VZ200
awesome computer. Well actually it was absolutely rubbish but I saved up for it
for a long time and I was so looking forward to it. It had those chiclet
rubberized keys. I think it was a rebranded TRS-80 so it was an Australian
one but it's basically a trash 80 if four kilobytes of memory I think it had
you know you couldn't do a lot with it but it was like the gateway to computers
evermore and then I got into the computer Commodore's and the Amiga's and
that was like I loved all that stuff was the Dick Smith which I was gonna bring
that up keep going so I was gonna ask if that was a kind of rebrand slash clone
Of another one. It sounds like it. It definitely is you said you saved was that that was yours then you'd like
That was for your own purpose or was that like a like a home thing that that was mine
I was pretty much the only one in the family that had any interest whatsoever
The family played the Atari but then I was the only one that actually wanted a computer
I think my brother might have tried to do some
Statistics on it or something because he was in high school or something like that at the time
So I think he might have used a little bit but mainly it was mine. My sister's like whatever nerd
Also just to jump in Jason Dick Smith. I'm not sure if you're where is actually a person. He's an accomplished Australian entrepreneur
It's not innuendo or a joke. I figured that I assumed it was like some kind of department store
Like because there'd be like a like a Sears whatever here
So I figured Dick Smith was like a some kind of store off to see dick. That's right
He's great at ripping off other ideas and making them Australian, like sort of putting an Australian sort of twang to it
So basically Dick Smith stores were a ripoff of... were they a ripoff of Tandy?
Which was a ripoff of Radio Shack in America. I think so. Yeah, I think that's kind of how it goes
But yeah, he's ripped off Vegemite. There's some like Dick Smith Aussie-mite. Speaking of Vegemite
There's a fun Vegemite fact on the Hemispheric Views Microdot blog account if you haven't seen it already
Someone was doing some vegemite research yesterday
Up to the listeners to guess yeah, so yeah jumping ahead
I had my Commodore Amiga my Amiga face or I loved it that wasn't I played games
But I that's where I really got into the whole idea of workbench which and its operating system
I read an article just the other night actually I should put it in the show notes about how beautiful the
Operating system of the Amiga was and how it still it had like scripting language it had
Tasking it had like a Unix style file structure. You could use the terminal and a GUI at the same time
It was way ahead of its time and I loved it
It was really cool
But it just didn't really progress anywhere and I held on as long as I could which looks like about
1997 and I got a junkie
Chunky IBM PC thing made by the company Packard Bell Jason. Do you know Packard Bell? Oh, yeah, it was pretty bad
That's how I learned to hack registries and all that in Windows. Oh, yeah, and then on to the custom-built PCs
And then finally we get to the interesting time where it was like
07 ish and I got my first Apple MacBook. This was the 17-inch
Like the first one they made that was an Intel chip. Yeah, and
So that was what pushed me over the edge
I've been following Apple for a long time, but never wanting to commit the dollars, you know
walk into like the Apple reseller shop and look at them and drool over them and say they're cool
but never actually buy one. Finally, when they went to Intel, I was like that I'm gonna do it.
That computer, I loved it, but it was so flawed. It got so hot. It would roast your legs.
It was the computer that I loved to have, but I hated to have at the same time. And I hated to
carry it because it was so big. Yeah and it sort of hadn't really got the
unibody down yet it was still a multi construction so you'd pick it up if you
held it sort of in a corner if the whole thing would creak. Yeah could you feel
the flex? Yeah yeah yeah and it was it was heavy and it was hot and I had that
giant screen but man it was just like this is the future it was so cool and it
was like I am never not gonna have Apple again as long as I can help it it was so
much better than all those PCs that had come before. So 2007 was the was the
tipping point it looks like around there 2006-2007? Yeah that's about when they did
that transition over to Intel and I was like yep I'm in. Was that your first
transition from desktop to laptop also? It was yeah yep so I remember taking the
lugging this 17-inch into my work and sort of like setting it up next to my PC
in the office. With the power, with the giant power brick, because the battery lasted no
time at all being a 17 inch laptop. Yeah, but it was just so cool to have. And I don't
really know what I did. I think I might have used a bit of Omni Outliner and stuff. That
was kind of all I used it for, but it's just the concept of having it there. It was a lot
of fun. And then moved on through the laptop range. So I had a 15 inch MacBook Pro, and
And then the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display, which still lasted and lasted and
lasted and literally got put to bed.
My wife's version of that got put to bed this afternoon.
Oh, and why is that?
We got two new babies in the family today.
Very exciting.
Congratulations.
And we're talking technical babies, aren't we?
We are.
We are.
What if somebody's phone just crashed right there and they're like, "Oh my God!"
Yes, we're the proud parents of two MacBook Air M1s, both with 16 gigabyte of RAM, space
gray and they are beautiful.
Can you guys still hear me even though you're both so much faster than me now on your M1s
and I'm back here in the slow lane with my Intel chip?
Am I still coming through okay?
We are getting warnings about you constantly but we didn't want to say anything.
I thought so.
saying someone here is inferior. I knew it. I knew it. If it makes you feel better. I
am still podcasting tonight from this broken down piece of junk Intel iMac that I've got
here in front of me. So yeah, we've got the M1 just behind me over there. Of which the
iMac was perfectly awesome like 13 seconds prior to opening the box of the new Mac. This
thing sucks! This is the worst computer I've ever used. I got the whiff of that, that fragrance
of Apple factory chemicals and it was like, "Oh, the one that doesn't smell like my candle."
So I don't know if that's a bit of a run down of my ownership. I've got consoles in there. I've
got some iPads and iPods and all that sort of stuff. I haven't actually got my... What was the
iPod? The clicker wheel. I just realized that's not... I think I decided that wasn't a computer
Nora game console. It was the first one that was the first one I got. I held off a long time but I
got the iPod with video. That's when the screen went wider. Yeah yeah and it got a bit thinner
I think and it was just awesome. I found it in the attic the other week and I held it and it
still feels perfect. Like just you can't beat that design. Amazing. So I'll put this diagram
in the show notes. Happy to have feedback from anybody. It does need updating. Maybe that's
something I need to get onto. I might need to re-license OmniGraffle to do it.
Very exciting. That should be your first M1 task.
That's a good idea.
Might be M1 ready. I'm not sure though.
Fingers crossed with the Omni group.
And Andrew's done a lovely job with it, as we can see. No one is misunderstanding
the chronology and tidiness of this diagram, so I congratulate you.
Thank you. Very type A personality diagram.
Well, I think the whole, I think the sentence you said last, where you said,
where's the iPod?
And then you went into almost a self argument with yourself right there about
whether it was a, a games console or a computer.
No, it's not really either. Yeah. You know what? You're off the list.
And I could just see that happening in real time again.
Like it did however many years ago you made this.
Does a felt tabletop and game center count? I don't know.
It went there there at some point there was like in his actual mind mapping,
Like that was an endpoint somewhere.
I could see it happening.
It was just like mind node was coming out of his head.
I just was watching it happen in real time.
Oh, I've lost it.
It's frightening how close to the truth you are.
I'm that transparent.
We're all over you.
You can see it.
But speaking of OmniGraffle, it looks like Jason's a bit of a user as well.
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.
I'm guessing this was an OmniGraffle job.
Oh, a hundred percent.
So we're opening up Jason's diagram now.
Yes.
Mine is the lovely slash ugly green square with a circle in the
middle that looks like a bullseye.
I don't know why it looks like that.
I went a little bit of a different route and I kind of broke everything
into like four sections of my life.
Based on time.
So I have what I call the game console era, 82 to 1990, which simply just
means I was a kid and all I had were game consoles.
So there you go.
Very big Nintendo, uh, person.
So NES, super NES game boy towards the end of the, uh, of the eighties into the
nineties, we did have an IBM computer at home that my dad, I believe had for work.
The debatable how much work was really done on it.
And it was probably more just, I want to play with a computer.
because they're kind of new thing and hey, it's a business expense.
So I think that's kind of how that ended up at our house, because I don't frankly
remember there being much more than flight simulator going on on that
computer, uh, and, and solitaire.
So call that bookkeeping if you want.
Did he not play leisure suit Larry?
Or was that pre?
I don't, I don't think, I think, um, I think flight simulator was like the most
games centric that that anyone really got.
Right.
And then I played like, you know, learning games, Carmen, San Diego,
stuff like that.
Uh, but I do remember spending many, many hours on flight simulator,
just trying to a figure out how to get the stupid plane to take off.
And then B once that happened, how do you actually land?
Both of which were horrendously difficult in a game that just seemed
like it really shouldn't be that hard.
It's like they took the actual control system from a plane and then put graphics on it from like 1990.
They're like, "Go! You got this!" Like, "I've never flown a plane." "That's fine."
"You've got a QWERTY keyboard."
Yeah, go for it. It's page up, page down, obviously.
Can I just ask, what's that game console with the sort of the purple
flushings on it? I don't know my consoles that well from that era.
That's the Super NES in the US version.
Ah, okay.
Ours was grey and purple. There was two different... same with the NES. In Japan it was like the kind of goldy red color.
We just had different colored versions because... I don't know.
So nothing else was different other than your interesting PowerPoint?
No.
It would have been NTSC. We would have had the PAL version.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah. That confused me to no end as a kid on iMovie. I was like, "It's PAL? I think?"
Yep. Yep. Yep. And when you would find movies and they were in pal and you're like, wait,
how does that mean? I don't understand.
It means it was better quality. I can, I can vouch for that. Okay. Had more scan lines.
Back to beta max, um, into the nineties, uh, that is when computers happened. So that's
my personal computer era. That's what I'm calling that. And that was, let's see, 1996
the very first computer that I got that was actually mine and that was the
Compaq Presario 4784. It obviously left quite a mark that I still remember the
model number of this, looking back now, horrifically ugly and weirdly designed
computer. It had on the top it had a built-in system for storing five CDs
just you know if your five favorite CD-ROMs got them right there it had more
plastic molding around it than anyone ever needs and then it had these what I
can only describe as atrocious speakers that clipped on the side but as soon as
you took them off again the clips broke so you could never get them back on so
very well designed my packet bill had ear speakers as well that was totally
just a thing. I guess it just, for some reason they thought, well, we don't want
to put anything on the desk because we've already taken up nine tenths of
your desk with this monitor that is so big. But I will say one thing about this,
this was back when we had dial-up internet. These computers sucked. I had a
webcam. I don't know what even resolution it was. It was huge. But I do remember
doing video calling with it over dial up with a webcam across.
It was basically from one side of the country to the other.
And it pretty much worked.
How did you do that?
I have no idea.
I don't recall what app we would have used or what, sorry, program we would have
used, um, if that was something that was maybe part of the, cause we had the same
computers, we had the same model and everything.
So it might've been like a, some gimmicky compact thing to show how
advanced their computers were.
I don't know.
I remember it wasn't super great.
It didn't always work, but the fact that we were doing video calling back in.
Had to be 97 maybe was looking back now.
It's like, how the hell did we do that?
Obviously now we're walking around and we've got, you know, 4k
FaceTime in your pocket, but that was something that was like,
just blew me away back then.
Quick question, sorry, I want to know, were you one of those kids who grew up in the US
with one of those inbuilt home intercoms like in Ferris Bueller?
I did have one of those, yes.
There you go, all right.
I used to lust after that.
Because I'm a kid born in the 90s, right, in Australia, seeing this thing from the 80s going,
"That's a thing? Oh, amazing."
And it's this fantasy that I learned my fellow co-host has grown up with.
It was such a thing too, like so a lot of houses had it, well not a lot, but houses did have that
then and I don't think it was more about I think people wanting to have it than wanting to actually
use it. I think that's really what it came down to because it was kind of, I guess you could call
somebody on that but you could easily just say "hey down the hall" like it's not, I don't know,
It was always kind of a thing you knew was there but no one really ever used it except
when you're kids you use it as like for pranks and stuff.
Did you also have a laundry chute and a garbage compactor thing in the sink?
Yes.
You had both of those?
This is like every family American film I've ever seen.
You had a laundry chute?
Yeah.
Was there someone at the other end waiting?
No.
Did you ever dive into it?
No, but I always did think it seemed pretty horribly dangerous to just have like a giant
hole going down through your house that you don't really know what's in there and you're
just kind of throwing things down it.
And you had a garbage dispenser thing in your sink.
Yeah.
You could just throw any random, just any random crap, just throw it down the sink and
it'll be fine.
Yeah.
Wow, you really were living much older dreams.
Well, all of this has happened before and it's happening again with the HomePod intercom.
So yeah, absolutely.
And much better video calling now as per this, not to say that Skype is anything worth talking
about, but I took you away from your diagram.
I'm sorry.
That was just pretty important stuff we needed to cover there.
No, that's I think it was my fault.
No, it's all good.
Yeah.
So back to the quadrant top right for those playing at home, probably the most pivotal
formative years for me.
Again, first personal PC that was mine,
first mobile phone in I think 1999, maybe 2000,
it was right on the edge there.
The Nokia 282, the Palm,
anything that was a small computer I wanted,
I would do anything to have.
Didn't really need them,
it was just the fact that you could have a computer
that you could bring around with you,
'cause everyone's impressed by that.
Look at my computer in my pocket.
Cool.
And then PCs in general, much like your diagram, Andrew,
where it was just like a long string of custom built,
build your own, put a bunch of shit together, computers.
Because the fun was taking it apart
and putting it back together almost more
than using it for anything.
And even once you got it together physically,
it was still about taking apart and putting together
software components more so than actually using them. It was just kind of, it was more
about tinkering than anything else. So that was definitely that whole time. And then that
all went away. So speaking iPods into the portables era, iPod third gen was my first
iPod. I remember it was very, very costly. I think it was around $400 if not more, but
It came in a giant box.
It had firewire, it had all kinds of accessories in the box,
all the little stupid spacers
so you could put it in various docks
'cause they had to have the correct spacer
and all that stuff.
- I still have the box of those, yep.
- Yeah, I figured with an iPod Hi-Fi necessary.
But yeah, the iPod third gen,
that was my first introduction to Apple design.
And that was very, very pivotal for me.
And I remember everybody looking at me like,
you know you can get an MP,
'cause MP3 players were still, they were new,
but it was long enough into it by that point
where you go down and get, you know,
off-brand MP3 player for close to no money.
- You get a creative Rio or a Microsoft Zoom in brown.
- Which is probably what I had, honestly.
I think I had some of those creative Rio whatevers
with the weird design that looked like the 90s still.
And it was like, you spent 400 and what dollars on a iPod.
And it was still kind of like from Apple who,
at that point, if you were doing Apple stuff,
people looked at you even more sideways, like,
the hell, what are you using that, you know,
that toy computer for?
But yeah, iPod third gen, huge.
The trio line of phones,
because it melded basically my Palm 7
my Nokia phone together, which was just amazing.
I don't forget Blackberry.
I, I had, I had a Blackberry at work for a while and I felt like, I felt like a
stockbroker.
Yeah.
If you had a Blackberry, whoo.
Yeah.
I was a big Blackberry person.
I remember setting up and like paying for a Blackberry, what was it called?
Blackberry enterprise server or something.
Yeah.
Because you had to have it cause they were for businesses.
They weren't for like people to have.
But we know why Andrew liked it because he's the briefcase guy.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
He had the briefcase with a little pocket where you could put your phone in there
because you never carried your phone.
It was always in your briefcase.
As long as you can see the flashing red light when you knew something had
happened.
It's like, Oh, Oh, I've got to check my mail.
Oh, don't get me started on the notification light.
Oh my gosh.
Okay.
So quick side tangent here.
There was a several year period there prior to the iPhone and then after the
iPhone of I just I could call it nothing but an obsession to find the phone with
the perfect little status notification lights and that was part of the reason I
used Android for a while because I absolutely loved the little stupid light
looking back I think it's just like a stupid like social media kind of thing
right where like you're looking to get that like kick of whatever so anything
would make the little light blink was just pure adrenaline for my, for my
body.
And then when the iPhone came out and it didn't have the little notification
lights that all the other ones had, I was like, Oh God, what do I do?
Like I have to get this phone, but it doesn't have a notification light.
And then I remember when you'd go through jail, break everything.
And there'd be like little stupid hacks to make like a light, but the whole
screen had to come on, obviously, because it was an LCD.
So it'd be like a black screen with like a green.
It was terrible.
It was really bad there for a while.
So that's iPhone.
And then first laptop I believe was the, well, first Mac laptop.
I had a couple of PC laptops that were just utter trash, but a laptop
was like super expensive back then.
So it was like any piece of crap that was technically not plugged into the wall.
Love it.
Uh, first Mac laptop, PowerBook G4, 12 inch, still the best computer ever made.
It was so good.
I wanted one of those so much as well.
That was so cool.
It just was, it felt so ahead of its time and, oh man, I
hacked the hell out of that thing.
I remember like we, you could take the lid off the front lid off and like put
in a piece of colored gel, like a, uh, like that plastic kind of see-through
stuff, front of the Apple logo.
Yeah, exactly.
And then like you could have your logo be different colors.
And then, okay, moving into the modern era.
Mac desktop.
So the Mac pro 2009 Mac pro.
I still have it in the garage and actually ran it probably up
until about three years ago.
Wow.
That thing, it still works today.
You could use it perfectly fine.
And there's, there's actually a pretty good market for aftermarket.
Pieces to kind of make it modern again.
So you can have like handoff and all that stuff, but I don't want
to deal with that crap anymore.
And of course Apple Watch, iPad, huge kind of transforming from mobile to like truly
mobile and then the move into not just Nintendo anymore but everything.
Just give me all the consoles.
And that's where we're at today.
Questions, comments, concerns?
Well this isn't a question that we asked Andrew but I think we can turn to him in a moment
after you.
I know when we were going through your desk you picked out the palm on your shelf as the
thing that you would save from a fire. Out of this set of quadrants here, what would
you say is the ultimate formative device? Like the one that had the biggest impression
on you? Not necessarily the one that you would save from a fire, but the one that led you
or influenced you the most. Wow. I'm gonna cheat. I'm gonna pick two.
They are not the rules laid down.
So, whatever.
Hey, I signed nothing.
Okay.
Okay.
Game Boy had to be.
I love games.
I still do to this day.
And I think the mobile thing, because that was a theme throughout my whole life.
I always wanted tech to be smaller and more pocketable and more portable.
And like the Game Boy, there's, I mean, I don't know if there's a really a better representation
of pocketability from the past.
And then I would say the iPod, not because of what it does or what it is, but what it
represents in a turning point in my view on design and usability as a consumer.
And I think that's led a lot for the rest of my life as I have consumed many things,
but also designed and created many things.
I think that was really the turning point for me that when I realized things can be
Delightful and great and really nice and well designed
Instead of just here's a thing that we made you figure out how to fit yourself into that
Products could be turned on their head and designed to fit what you needed
I'm fine with your cheating because that was a good answer. Yes, Andrew. What about you because we didn't ask you
Yeah, but it's a very easy answer for me to give it's the Commodore Omega 500 that thing was
My youth in so many ways that was like the hub of my entire life. It brings back memories of
Sleepovers all night gaming nights with my friends, which was so much fun
Yeah, it was sitting around with joysticks in hand playing games all night through so it's a social element
Then it was the the area that I learned sort of both hardware and software
Upgrades to the memory a slot in new memory chip memory cards and that sort of thing
But I even remember once putting in a new a new CPU or something
I can't remember quite what it was
but it was one of the chips and it was like a socketed chip and so you had to take it all apart and
Unseat the old one and reseat the new one and that was kind of like my first experience of hardware
Fiddling and so that was really interesting to do and then the amount of hours I put in
Into learning how the operating system worked. So I just knew the thing
Backwards and forwards inside now, you know, this is the thing I look back now
I'm like, where did I spend all that time?
but it was just learning the computer inside and out and just wanting to be able to
Find new things find new ways of doing stuff and to this day. I still read the Amiga forum on reddit
I still go in there and have a look and see what people are doing with it
I like that. It's the Amiga forum, but it's now on reddit like it used to be like a
BBS looking thing way back now now it's on reddit
As long as it lives, right?
Another great answer.
I love the idea of that flowing through to sum up your efficiency, your devotion to productivity.
I love that.
That's really, really good.
I'd never thought about that actually until just now as I was talking.
I was like, "That really is it."
Martin, do you want to tell us about your lifelong move into font creation?
Yeah, font creation.
Look, I'm very flattered.
You can come up with a name for it if you like.
We'll do something about that.
Natasha was making fun of it.
Could you call it anything other than felt?
Felt grotesque.
We'll take that.
I think that works.
But you can read it.
There are no problems.
Beautiful.
It's beautiful.
I love it.
Nothing from me.
Very nice.
Well, listeners, if you open up this apparently fine piece of typographic work, beautiful.
I'm very happy.
So I took a bit of a different approach and focused on six things that I consider to be
very formative. I cut out things that personally I find very important or arguably tie with certain
things but I had to make harsh decisions. So really my computing life started when I was
five years old with the 1997 power Macintosh 6500. You are such a baby, such a baby. It never just
blows me away every time you're so young. Well look I mean if you need justification or any
sort of explanation for why the Mac is burnt into me, there was no PC period before this. I grew up
with PCs at school, I used PCs a lot alongside Macs at home, but the presence of the Mac at home
meant that there was no chance that I would ever look at that for more than three seconds.
So that computer was actually suggested to the family by my aunt, who was serious, and still is
serious Apple devotee, you know, given Apple Newton's at university through her educational
job and stuff so she was like "you must buy this" and convinced the family in the year
that the company was apparently about to go bankrupt. So it shows how much research my
family was doing at the time. But yeah, having that experience with the more classic Mac OS
and a lot of the beeps and bloops and the chime and the big extended keyboard,
I loved that thing. So even though it was arguably their worst period of design or success,
That carryover from the legacy of the earlier Mac made a huge impression on me.
So that's why that one ranks as the first.
Look at that tower.
Oh my gosh.
That is just nothing good looking about that.
Not at all.
Not at all.
But it was, uh, it was very dear to me.
It's the most PC looking Mac there could ever be.
I said it looks like a marshmallow in a way.
Yeah, it's almost like that Mola Mac.
What? I can't remember the name of that.
You know what I'm talking about.
Yeah.
It's like a gigantic deformed tooth.
You could probably do a whole semester's design deconstruction course just on the atrocities
that have happened with this design. Yeah you're right there's nothing super special about the
look of this machine but I did love you know I remember using stuff like QuickTime VR
and playing Myst and that sort of stuff as a kid and I loved it. So when people say look at this
360 video or photo thing that you can have on Facebook I'm thinking I was playing with these
things when I was five or six in QuickTime and they you know their eyes glaze over and I go
don't worry just use your Facebook thing. But yeah shifting to the next device I put the Gameboy
Color down. Now I'm pretty sure it was called Neotones Ice. I think it was like a Japanese
and Australian exclusive particular version of translucent plastic influenced probably by the
iMacs of the time. Everything went translucent with colored plastic. But the reason I've put
this down is that although I'm not a huge gamer this was really the first personal device that I
had. Nothing like an organizer or a computer really but something that you could sit down
with in an individual fashion and play through a game. From there the only sort of set of
Microsoft products to ever enter the house were Xbox branded. There was a 360 after this but
I don't really rank that. This first Xbox that got me into the whole thing like parties for
multiplayer with friends, Halo and so on. And it isn't pictured in this particular device diagram
but I had the, I think they called it the Duke controller. Do you know what I'm talking about
when I use that word? It was like the massive Xbox controller, 150% the size of this one. It was like
gigantic for children's hands and I held on to that thing until the cable frayed and then went
and got a replacement one on eBay because it was like a dinner plate in your hands. More like a
bread and butter plate actually. But anyway, that was formative in the sense that it got me gaming
with friends and opened up different discussions and ways of thinking about computers. But I
actually attached it to the 4k OLED in the lounge room fairly recently and my goodness it takes up
a very small amount of that screen. It's sort of like the equivalent of looking at what must be an
original Macintosh display relative to the size. It's like oh yeah I can see the heads up there,
that's good. I remember mine was plugged into a Sony Trinitron. It was like my, you know,
I'm moving out of home and I'm like a big person now.
And I had an Xbox and a Sony Trinitron flat screen.
And I was like, look at me go.
Hello ladies.
- Now the Power Mac G4, that was another family computer,
but funnily enough, it was like a donation
from that same aunt.
We didn't buy it.
And even though we shifted to the Intel iMac,
not long after that,
this was the computer where I first used Mac OS 10
on a regular basis.
and all of the jaggedness of the classic Mac OS
had been pushed aside for Aqua,
and I went, "Oh my goodness."
And it was my introduction to the iLife suite
and all of these glossy new things.
So that was really my training to enter the modern era,
if you want to put it that way.
And I loved the curve of that machine.
I just thought it was really cool.
- Is that the color you guys had?
- Yes, I found the same picture.
But yeah, in that same year, I also got the iPod mini,
which similar to the Game Boy point was really embarking on personally carrying your own
music. It had always been family music before then. And it's, you know, getting into the
whole, you know, managing your own metadata and library. It's so much more personal. So
that one sticks with me. And I still think that is the nicest thing ever to hold in your
hand as a computer or some sort of device. I bet both of you guys were huge ID3 tag nerds.
Yeah, things have to be correct.
But look, something that bothers me to this day, with the whole Apple Music/Spotify era we're in now,
is that they don't - and this is troublesome, from Apple, I have to say - they don't respect title case properly.
They will actually capitalize prepositions and various things, which I don't quite like.
Nothing makes Martin angrier than an incorrectly titled preposition.
No, he hates going through my show notes and correcting all of my awful mistakes.
Sorry to be a bastard. Not just a bastard, an anal bastard! Oh god. That's the best kind.
Would you prefer that I don't do it anymore? No, no, do it. Make it good. Very good. Anyway,
that brings me to the last one, and that was my first personal computer, the unibody MacBook
13 inch. Not the pro, the one that came with fewer ports and it was really that first of
of the unibody construction.
And that computer I still have in the other room.
It's still running.
I just did a replacement battery, some RAM upgrades.
It's a beautiful machine,
although it's obviously thicker by today's standards.
But you know, I used that for my final high school year.
I did my undergraduate degree and like honours thesis stuff
on it, it went through a lot of work
and I loved that machine.
So that was the workhorse ultimately.
And that's the summary.
Love it.
- Asking the question to you now,
which of those items, if it's, I assume it will be one of those,
which is the one that's most important to you, you know,
you had to rescue it from a fire.
- The one that I would rescue from the fire
would probably be, it would be almost a tie
between the iPod mini and the MacBook 13-inch,
but maybe the iPod just as a design piece.
Although I would say the one that was the most influential,
despite its relative ugliness,
would be the Power Macintosh from '97.
Everything follows that.
- I think you should choose the iPod.
easier to get out of a burning house with the dipod rather than that power
Mac yeah I'd probably die taking it out that's right and whatever heavy metals
or things were in it that will catch fire and poison me as I try to escape
what if I introduced a new topic area known as unannounced trivia corner are
you ready that was an explosion are you ready here we go first question this is
Oh man.
I'm not, I didn't tell you about this.
This is a new thing we're doing.
We're doing trivia between both of you for points.
Points!
Oh God.
So you better, you better do well.
We get a buzzer.
First question.
They're all multiple choice.
First of all, let me lay the ground rules.
Multiple choice.
You each will answer.
No commentary because you could give it away to the other person.
All right.
So here we go.
First question.
How many pins does a VGA cable have?
A, 11, B, 13, C, 15, or D, 16.
- Okay, I've locked in my answer.
- Okay, go ahead.
- 15, C, 15.
- Okay, Martin?
- Well, I'm just gonna be different
and the number 13 sounds stupid, so I'll choose that one.
- Okay.
The best part is I'm not gonna tell you
who got it right and who got it wrong.
(laughing)
So you're not gonna know.
Okay, next question.
- Stupid analog cables.
- There are three questions today.
So question number two, which of the following was a common dial up modem speed?
14.4, 28.8, 33.6, or D, all of the above? Martin, you go first this time. You go first this time.
Okay. I'm a sucker for all of the above, so I'll go for that one.
Okay. Andrew?
It's absolutely all of the above, and I think I'm dialing with all of them.
Okay. Are you using any of them right now? That's the real question.
Question number three. Jason's using them for this video.
Cool. Question number three of unannounced trivia corner, similar to the first question
and related to our previous discussion. How many pins did the iPod dock connector have?
A 15, B 28, C 30, D 60. Both seem pretty confident. No self-respecting Apple person
I shouldn't get this wrong.
- Andrew?
- C30.
- Okay.
- Same, same here.
- All right, and that has been unannounced trivia corner.
Thank you for playing.
- Do you know who won?
- Oh, this is ongoing.
You don't know when it started.
You don't know when the game is gonna end.
You just don't know.
You don't even know your current score.
How awesome is that?
- Right now I need Vincent's button
'cause I wanna push Vincent's button
and have you fall through the floor.
- I feel like some basil pesto spaghetti myself actually.
(laughing)
- So he sent in another photo of the drawer, okay?
- I know.
- Really?
- Like you just, how much do you need to rub this in?
It's like those, you know what I thought of instantly, you know those gigantic mural ad
things that Apple puts in its Apple stores where they arrange all of the products in
like a diagonal grid formation?
100% that's what it reminded me of, in a drawer.
Vincent's the kind of guy that would go to McDonald's, order a Big Mac, and it would
come out and it would look like the Big Mac in the ads, not like the sad Big Mac you actually
get given.
Yeah.
He just lives in this world of perfection.
I don't know how he does it.
Everything's propped up by toothpicks.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
That drawer was insane.
And we know that the button now helds headphones.
It's a headphone hook.
Well, it's double purpose.
I still think it's a button.
It seems a little dangerous to have headphones on there.
Cause what if you go to push the emergency drop through the floor
button and the headphones stop it.
Now you just, now you're in this weird, awkward situation where the person
clearly knows you were trying to drop them down a hole, but it didn't work.
Do you just kind of like play it off like, "Oh, I was just kidding. I don't know."
That's the situation I've never considered, frankly.
You got, you got to, you know, three steps, three steps ahead.
You got to be thinking about these things.
Well, look, I look forward to the next unannounced trivia corner,
whenever that may be, if indeed it ever happens again, or we find out our scores.
You'll never know.
I do know I'm going to go Googling VGA cables soon.
Well, maybe I could just go to my office and look at the monitors that they give us.
The answers are out there.
[SIGH]
