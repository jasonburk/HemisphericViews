- [Episode 60 of Lounge Ruminator](https://loungeruminator.net/2021/02/06/60-contemplating-telepresence-with-jason-burk/)

**Build Macros. Get Gold. Don't Die.**

Macro Dungeon is a twist on the classic dungeon crawler. Up to four players take turns drawing cards and making movements through one of four caves, in an attempt to outpace their competitors on the way to the treasure room. Players can advance in boring one-increment moves or use strategy to build macro moves, which can contain up to five moves and allow you to jump ahead of the competition. Get _Macro Dungeon_ today and start building macros to make your way to victory! Oh, and watch out for those dragons!
