[Music]
So here we are, episode 20 of Hemispheric Views.
What an exciting time to be alive.
So I think we should start the show off with a bit of a time check
Because we're recording at a very slightly different time
For me, it's quarter past eight in the evening pretty much perfect time to be recording a podcast
I think I think we call that the golden hour
Finally being in WA pays off. What's the time over there Jason?
It's more perfect. It's
415 a.m. Good morning. The the best hour for doing anything
You watch the sunrise as you
Podcast away. I feel great. I feel alert. I feel ready
I feel episode 20 and Martin. What time is it there?
Well, look I've been upgraded to a more human hour
It's now quarter past 11 in the evening. So it's still the same day as both of you
Which is unheard of you're gonna get our best performance today. We're all in the same
Time zone sort of same day. We're all in sync. I'm not in the future anymore. It's kind of depressing
And moving away from the future into the past but into the present because that's what follow-up is Andrew you have a special follow-up item
For us I do you may recall us talking about
Assets my techno technology assets that I've maintained over time
One of those assets the long-lived Apple cinema display has finally
Left my ownership. I was able to sell it got 200 bucks for my cinema display
Which I thought was pretty good because I paid
$1,299 for it on the 15th of January
2011 and
People will know that I know that stuff because I maintain it an asset lifespan spreadsheet
So that was all good and I worked out that what it cost me
About two dollars forty seven per week. I think was the number and then when I sold it, I suddenly thought hang on
I got 200 bucks in my pocket
How do I reflect that in the spreadsheet?
So I had to I had to re-engineer it. I had to go back go back look at it and think how am I gonna
Do this I've created a new column. I
Now have a resale value column
Which allows me to put the $200 income back into it and now reflect the fact that if you think about it originally cost me
$1,299
200 back at the end of it my cost per week now less resale has come down to two dollars and nine cents
How good is that? This is like a whole new world
It's actually inspired me because now I'm looking at all my other assets and thinking what else can I dispose of and reduce?
that total cost per week. See when you mentioned this I thought this is
fantastic and I had to send you a message of congratulations which you
seemed very happy to receive it's a big moment for you and your family but I'm
also a little bit concerned about what happens with this column because you say
that you're going to have to you know look at other things that you want to
put in this resale column but what happens if you don't what happens if
If it's mostly blank, is that okay with you?
Well, yeah, I mean I have to I have to think of the heritage value as well
So some of these things need to go in the you know
The shelf of memories and they have what I did do though
Just to soften the blow a little bit as I've started to fill it out
I went down and I realized I had an iPhone 8 plus listed there, which was ridiculous. That was so expensive
I had it for a short period of time and it was like
$13.45 a week. That's ridiculous, right?
And then I thought no I traded that in so I got I did the trade-in thing on a new iPhone or new
Something or other but I think I've got 350 bucks for it
So I quickly plugged that in and which has taken it down to a much more reasonable $8.79 per week
Sure, I'm not gonna fill all the columns, but I am
Looking for things to get rid of so if if anybody wants to maybe buy
Samsung TV
It's a bit old bought in
February 2017 for 498 bucks happy to get rid of it. It's not very good. Are you turning hemispheric views into gumtree?
Well, I should I successfully sold the cinema display via gumtree so didn't get scammed
The guy came to my house
I told Jason this actually on the chat that he sort of said are you gonna do a back alley?
Transaction I was like no just told the guy where I live and he can pop over
And he came in came into my lounge room and I turned the monitor on and showed him it was in perfect condition
He was like, yeah, it looks good. We did the transaction
We did PayPal cash transaction thing me up and away he went happy as Larry
Did you feel a moment of sadness because you do have a nostalgia shelf?
I know Jason has one but you've got a place where you put these things and the cinema display is a nice-looking product
Did you have any problem?
Parting with that only a small amount of sadness. I think
Yeah, when I turned it on and looked at it for that last time I was a hottie such a beautiful display, but it's not retina
And I think it's soft in the blow, but I'm talking I'm using an iMac
So it's I've still got a big screen if I didn't have a big Apple screen
It would probably be a little bit more difficult, but now this is it was okay. It was time to go
It's it's it's serving a longer life now. It's helping another person in the world. Well speaking of Samsung stuff
I've got a Samsung display here if you want to buy that
How much is it costing you per week? I don't know. You know, I don't track these things. I'm sure it would make a very happy
Happy person in Western Australia to use it
What do you reckon they wanted this display for I just I'm having a hard time wondering
It has so many limitations in today's world where it's like mini display port first of all
So that limits you to very old
Computers to connect it to and the resolution like you said, it's not retina. It was like 2560 by 1440 or something
Yeah, yeah, I just 200 bucks just I was shocked. I thought you'd be lucky to get you know
Here's 30 bucks and a candy bar at best
I'm pumped. I'm pumped. I reckon I reckon I won the lotto on this one. It was an older gentleman
He said he just bought it a secondhand
MacBook or something and he was fine with it
But he just needed a bigger screen to work with and so he was you know, obviously limited budget
He's got a secondhand computer
And you know, he's found a second hand monitor to go with it and he was he was happy
He was stoked with the price. He thought was great
Well, congratulations Andrew and talking about income. I
See, there's an update about coffee. You better this Andrew what's happening? Just a little update on the coffee
Donation we had yet another huge donation. I would expect it and maybe this is a sad reflection on me
I don't know how you guys are if somebody says buy me a coffee. I'll buy him a coffee, right?
I'm one coffee. Maybe if the chat goes a little longer. I'll buy him - it's implied. It's buy me a coffee
It's not buy me 50 coffees. I mean it could be don't don't not do that. But well
Well, there's a certain gentleman Eric out there who decided one coffee wasn't enough
He's bought us 10 coffees get out of here Eric. Who are you? I know right? I know
It's incredible. So Eric who I have actually seen on um, I haven't seen personally
I've seen a picture of him on micro blog where all the nicest people hang out
I saw him so I've seen a photo of him. So I know he's a real person
Apparently he enjoys having our company on runs, but he runs in like the snow
So he's tolerating as well needles. I see needles are hitting his face. I'm impressed. So we should be buying him coffee
I think I know he's generously not followed the instruction to buy a singular beverage and he's listening to us
I can't believe it. It's amazing. So thank you Eric. That's that's fantastic. We're gonna invest that
We're actually gonna be buying some GameStop shares with that
I thought we were gonna start our own podcast hosting company called fireside
So Eric your money is being well invested we appreciate it and it's very kind of you. Thank you
Well, if he's listened to any part of the beginning of this with your spreadsheet, he knows that it's being well accounted for
Speaking of investments and ways we're spending money and plans for the future. I think we might have another big announcement
stickers tour
I was hoping there'd be music there. Yes stickers the long long anticipated
addition to the hemispheric views of family
You can now get awesome cool stickers to stick on all of your stuff
hemispheric views comm slash stickers
Currently we have the show artwork on there. You can get that but if you go to that website, which you should be at right

So hemispheric view is broadening the e-commerce and blogging ecosystem like we're 10 years ago. Thank you listeners
It's amazing. I know one person who'll be stoked about the sticker store. You guys know who I'm talking about
Absolutely, I think I can guess and if he hasn't purchased one by now, I'm very upset
We're not outing him. That's the deal. I think yeah, we'll see you. We'll see if he can that would be too much pressure
We'll see if he can self-identify
now keeping the
We've got a lot of very commercy things here you taking over this CFO Andrew. This is unbelievable
We also have this is the best episode yet. I'm loving it. This is just turning into one big spreadsheet of financial report
Anyway, we have another announcement. Wait a second. Wait a second. Do you do you hear that? What's that?
an announced trivia corner
Coming in early! What? Yeah! Who's ready? I haven't been studying. It's earlier, you
should be on your game, ready to go. Question number one. Hey let me take a
sip of water, hold on. Oh, oh hold on we've got water sipping happening. Is that still

You guys do tend to agree. I don't know. Maybe I need to change the setup of this.
It's just the hemispheric view. Sorry. Keep going.
What was the original name of the company that we know today as Pepsi?
A. Pepsi Cola. B. Brad's Drink. C. Cola Beverage. D. Pepsin.
Do you want to go first this time, Andrew? Yeah, I'll go that first.
Was it Pepsi Cola Company? Pepsi Cola?
You're going with that one? Pepsi Cola.
Okay, yeah, right. What was D again? I've already forgotten.
D was pepsin. It's so horrible. I'm choosing that.
It's hard to get past Brad's drink, isn't it? Yeah, my memory was overwritten at that point.
Thank you for playing unannounced trivia corner.
Well, that was very on brand, Jason. Thank you. Because you seem to be the master of game
creation. You announced this in a number of ways, but you mentioned it on the separate podcast
that we did together when you joined the virtual lounge but i think you need to spend some more
time describing this you have created and launched your own board game yes another thing for people
to purchase this is just like so much money exchanging hands here poor eric he's already
given us coffee money and now he's got all this stuff that he's he's obligated to purchase as well
yes uh i did it's been a long road a i think some people may or may not know about it if you are
happened to be on the lovely micro blog.
You may have heard about this over, over time.
The process was interesting and convoluted and is still causing me
somewhat of a, um, uh, heartache just because making things and selling
things that are physical is really hard.
And I think this is just a really good reminder of that, no matter what, when
you're trying to make a thing to put into someone's hands, everything can go
wrong. I think anybody that's ever tried to do a Kickstarter or anything like
that or not tried to do one but tried to buy something on one knows that it's
gonna be late. It's probably not gonna be exactly what you thought it was gonna
be and it's just damn hard. But the game is done. I'm very happy with it. The name
of the game, I guess I should probably tell you that, is Macro Dungeon and it's
It's kind of a twist on a classic dungeon crawler kind of thing.
So you got up to four players taking turns drawing cards and making movements through
these various cave paths that are kind of one by one squares.
And the goal is for you to basically get to the treasure in the center before everyone
else.
The twist, the macro part, is that generally you can kind of go one move at a time with
a card.
say northeast, southwest, or wild, and you can decide to go in that direction if you
get the correct card.
The key is you can have these little macro brackets where you can then say, put one of
those down, put in up to five cards, put another macro bracket, and now for your single turn
you're moving five different spaces instead of one.
So that's where the strategy comes in, is you're trying to build a hand that can basically
get you ahead quicker.
it out it's MacroDungeon.com the name of the company that is making it which is
also what I made up is Coffee Pot Games. CoffeePot.games is where you can find
that game as well as there's already another one in the works so yeah check
it out please feedback is always welcome it's my first board game but I think
it's I think it's pretty dang good for a first go and it's kind of that print on
demand situation so as they get ordered they get made which is part of the part
of the problem with making physical goods is having someone to manufacture
it and ship it because you don't want to have your garage at home full of 60,000
board games that you then have to ship out because that's not very good and
you've got a lot of stuff sitting on the books as Andrew would say so yes I would
appreciate it if anyone would check it out if you're into board games or know
somebody that is. I'm also working on trying to get it on to Tabletopia if
you've heard of that where you can do board games basically virtually and you
can play with friends that way. Yeah so again anybody listening to this in the
southern hemisphere shipping is probably pretty brutal because again logistics
but that being said trying to get it out to more locations if I can and yeah
check it out thank you. So I have a very quick question because I think it's
fascinating when you first told us this I thought who on earth thinks to make a
board game and I'm not mocking you I just think it's amazing because you just
see big company names on established board game boxes in toy shops and stuff
it's just blew my mind a bit so what actually prompted you to do this how did
it come about this was actually my second game the first game was a little
I would say overly ambitious in terms of what was needed from an artwork perspective. So
as I got down that path, that one got set aside as this idea came into my head. And it really was
just, I wanted to do something that was not digital. I wanted to create something kind of
physical that wasn't a computer related thing because everything in my life is always computer.
So yeah, I just wanted to do something analog. I like board games
So the ideas just kind of came to me and I went with it and fortunately in today's world where you can pretty much
Get anything done on the internet. There are places where you can have people print
Physical board games now, which is kind of crazy. That's amazing. You don't have to go and try to pitch your game to
Hasbro or whatever and and you know, hope that it works out you can just do it. I think that's really awesome
Awesome.
Okay, so I thought, so with Safari, right, I've been, I've tried all the different ad
blockers and, because I'm ad block mania, but I've given up on them all because I've
gone to NextDNS as a server.
So I know there's, but I've still got one going, Hush, which I found out about from
Gruber because I think it does JavaScript blocking, so all the cookie pop-ups and things
like that.
I don't know how well it's actually working.
I did have one blocker and wiper both running.
I think they probably actually did a better job,
but they just seemed so full on.
And I think that's probably my biggest complaint
with extensions in general,
is that they're just so like intense
because they're really focusing in on that edge case nerd
and the edge case nerds want everything.
And it's just like far out.
And so harsh was just like one,
but one thing, load it and you're done.
And that's all I want from an extension.
I don't want to think about really mucking around
with them too much.
So, and then I use 1Password 'cause I kind of have to.
And what's the other one I use?
Oh yeah, that's right, StopTheMadness.
Talked about weird blockers, but that one,
I think it does good stuff.
- Does that just turn off the internet?
Does that just block the internet totally?
(both laughing)
- It sort of does some weird, it stops like click checking
and all those sorts of things
and like weird scroll patterns where if you know,
or if you can't drag and drop an image out
of a webpage and that kind of stuff,
I think it fixes a lot of that.
But it seems to make browsing better,
even though I couldn't really tell you
exactly what it does, so I run with that.
And then Markdown Linker,
which if you want to grab a Markdown link for a URL,
a URL is really good.
But that's about it for me.
And then I have a few on Firefox that I use specifically
like for YNAB and Readwise.
Just wondering, do you guys get into extensions at all?
And do you like the way they work?
Cause in Safari, again, Firefox is just gross.
Chrome's gross the way you got to find them in the year.
It's weird web page for configuring them and everything.
It's just bad UI.
It just seems like there's bad UI across the whole sphere of extensions.
I don't like the way anyone does it.
To be perfectly honest, I use Safari.
I don't use the other browsers.
I have Firefox.
I use it on occasion for a couple of things.
I think that model is terrible where it's just like random websites.
You're installing who the hell knows what, you know, you could be on.
Their Firefox browser, uh, extension gallery, maybe you're on some, you
know, John's website and he you're installing again, I don't know what
you don't, and then you have to go like, look in and dig and see what it's actually
doing.
So in that respect, I think the Safari model is good in the sense that you can be as sure as you can be that what you're installing into your browsers is safe.
You know, I think with the stuff we're doing in browsers nowadays, the focus on security and privacy of what these extensions are doing is of the utmost importance.
And, you know, you, you install an extension and it says, we can view all of your browsing
history and this and that and the other thing.
And we're just like, okay, yeah, go do whatever you want.
And steal my keystrokes.
You know, I don't think the Safari model really is great either.
I always find it confusing because you go to install it like in Safari.
If you go to Safari and then Safari extensions, you would think that opens
up where you do your extensions, but it doesn't, it then goes to the app store.
And you're like, wait, what?
Why am I going to the app store?
And then it's more confusing because if the app associated with the
extension is a paid app, like I've just opened it and there's something
called mate universal tab translator.
It's like, oh, that's cool.
I'd like to have an extension.
And it says $30 and you're like, wait, what extensions are $30?
No, not really.
the app, whatever it's called, Mate, is $30 and it has an extension.
It's like, Oh,
46.99 in Australia.
Well, I'm getting a deal.
So I'm going to buy that right now.
Cause it's on sale clearly.
So yeah, it's just kind of confusing how it works.
And I can't tell you that I have a better solution, but I can say that as, as much
as there tends to be some reluctance to everything being in the app store, I do
feel better about installing an extension through the App Store than I would off of,
you know, Joanne's super cool extensions.net because I don't know what that's doing. And
it may do what I want, but it may be doing a lot of other crap that I don't know about.
So I don't know. I think it's okay. Just on your $30 thing. Sorry. I just had to ask Andrew
this because that was really fast. Did you convert that on a website, Andrew, or was
that just in your head as CFO? No I've been doing this. Because I didn't see any
eye flickering or scrolling in your glasses. No I've been doing the same thing I followed the
links to the extensions page and of course because Apple uses its pricing
indexes or tiers, tiers they call them isn't it? So the Australian tier is
always like way more than the US version. I just wanted to know if you've gone
financially supernatural for a moment. Continue Jason, sorry.
Yeah, so Safari extensions, they're fine. I'm not a huge extension person myself either.
One password, of course, just because, you know, that's one password. That's how you use it.
I have the Ecosia thing installed because I've been using that as my default browser for,
I don't know since I guess since it became available as a default on the browser
Which actually we can talk about this another time, but I found it to be quite good
I have a confession to make I
Because I remember talking about a cozy on this very same show
Mm-hmm a long time ago getting excited about my trees
I'm sorry, man. The results suck. I
I think it's a Bing thing.
I've saved 307 trees, so.
Wow, you're doing it for the team then because I couldn't keep it up.
It was just the results weren't good enough.
Slight side tangent, what are you finding has better results then?
Are you just using Google?
I duck duck go.
Sometimes I Google.
I find the Ecosia 1f better than duck duck go.
Actually if I search from within the browser, it's duck duck go.
if I search by launch bar, I'm so programmed to just type command space,
goo, and then whatever I'm doing.
So I'm doing Google searches there and I've tried to retrain my fingers.
Gross.
I haven't succeeded.
I never think to go command space DDG.
No wonder you have so many ad blockers using Google.
No, no, man.
Sorry.
So I've got the Ecosia.
Uh, I have hush because I'm sick of seeing people tell me that they're
that cookies exist in the world.
Known that since 1992.
Great.
Don't need to see it every time.
By the way, in browsers, that should just be an option at this point to say,
except all stupid cook, like whatever we get it.
We don't need 50 stupid windows coming up over every webpage saying we collect
cookie.
Yeah.
That's how the internet works.
We get it.
Isn't that kind of the implication if you don't tick block all cookies?
Yeah, you would think that's it anyway.
Markdown linker.
Like you said, to grab markdown links works pretty good.
Tamper monkey I use because I have the, the user script that I made for
that's a grease monkey thing.
Basically.
Yeah.
Oh, great.
Like grease.
Yeah, exactly.
For, for running user scripts.
So I have that for the micro dot blog one that I maintain.
And then.
I think that's it.
I think that's the only ones that really isn't a lot going on
from an extension standpoint.
I think I guess I'm most annoyed that 95% of extensions are made because the original products are made badly
You know like we shouldn't need almost all of these stupid things
But every almost every extension seems to be a hack to fix the end product being made incorrectly or poorly
Hmm. What about you Martin? You sound like you're sort of a you're a nudist when it comes to extensions typical ones
like you said, hush, you know, one blocker stop the madness. The one that I really love
has such a niche specific purpose, but I suppose that's the point of all of these. It's fixerific,
which is the extension that Twitterific allows you to put into Safari. So if you do happen
to use twitter.com just within the web browser, it will eliminate the who to follow and trend
sections of the website. Very clever. See a hack to fix a product that is made. Exactly.
That's right. And look, I mean, I prefer using Twitterific or, you know,
just an app in general to the Twitter website, but quite often, you know,
I have to go in there because there's a group messaging situation or something
about the API that's different or whatever you can name it. But I will say,
I reckon extensions could be a lot more exciting.
And I remember I used to be a lot more excited by dashboard widgets when they
were a thing.
It sounds like you guys have much the same and I'm glad to hear,
it's interesting to hear that you guys are all using Hush.
That's one that I'm intrigued by because I shouldn't be surprised, should I?
That you nerds are using it too.
It's like we all read the same website or something.
Yeah, I know.
Crazy, huh?
One other thing I just thought of the problem with extensions is that I don't
like using stuff that I can't use everywhere.
And now if I get my Safari browser on the Mac, all tricked out with all these
crazy extensions and everything.
And then as soon as I pick up my phone, none of that exists.
And that's just super annoying to me.
It is annoying.
We need to have, if you're going to have extensions, especially with them being so
locked down through the app store and everything, they should be on iOS as well.
So iOS 15 feature request.
I would, I would hope so.
I don't know.
Yeah.
At this point, I just, I, in my life, I don't like when things are different
when I switch between devices and that's the biggest problem I'm having.
today with transitioning between the Mac and iOS.
It's just, I can make one so much different than the other
and then I kind of feel lost.
And I think that's mostly why I've been having this weird
like transition back into just using stock apps
for a lot of stuff because I know it's gonna be exactly
the same no matter what device I pick up.
And it's not, oh wait on this one,
it doesn't have the same custom theming
like it does on the Mac.
So I have to be in this other color scheme.
Ah, I just, I want it all the same.
I think I'm just past the past the age of dealing with all that, like all the
custom home screens people make that looks so awesome.
I think they're cool.
I can't be bothered.
I just can't, I don't want to remake an app that is a shortcut to open the
app that I'm trying to open just to like, no, I it's cool for screenshots, but it
seems like a total pain in the ass for real life.
Just I just noticed um, I think I could see behind you. There's some kids on your lawn
You might just want to tell them to get off. So that's hilarious because I actually
Home, and this is so good. So not too long ago a few weeks ago. There were actually kids out in front of my house
using our front yard like it was a playground and
Without even skipping a beat. I just screamed. Hey kids get off my lawn and then I really had to pause
And realize like I wasn't yelling at them. They couldn't hear me. I was in the house
I was it was for a comedic effect for my wife who was in the house
But it was just like wow that just came out
I've officially crossed a rocking chair with a rifle not no. No, I wasn't
Because that's like the classic image of yeah, the United States. Are you sure?
No, no, not here
but I did actually say something to the effect of get off my lawn and then I I
Thought it was hilarious in my cans my precious antique cans
This would be really quick really quick I just I had to tell people about this
We just watched this thing are either of you familiar with a thing called master class
Never used it, but yes, I've heard of it. Yeah, I got it after using it. I wouldn't probably recommend
Paying for it. So that's a big endorsement right there
But I literally I think I got it for like a year for like a dollar or something somehow
I don't remember what happened. But anyway, there was a thing on there that we watched recently and it was
called
The guy's name is Ron Finley and it's Ron Finley teaches gardening
Bear with me. Oh, yeah, the the tech his tagline
So he is he's a community activist and a self-proclaimed
gangster gardener
right and
He shows you how to do gardening for kind of you know, if you know nothing about anything he walks through but
The way he does it is he's first of all, he's hilarious
he's he's a no BS kind of guy and
I think I'll put a link to the
little kind of preview of it and even that doesn't do it justice because he if you're into people that like to
Use exotic language. Let's say
He does that throughout the whole thing and it's just the fact that he's sitting there talking about potting a little plant
But the way in which he he produces this information and it gives it to you. It's just it's it's amazing
So I'll put a link in that but if you have masterclass
I would say give it a watch if you even want to know anything about gardening because it's just it's hilarious
Just watching him explain this stuff. Did you say you got that masterclass for a dollar or something?
It was a yeah, I got it. I think it was a dollar or two dollars for a year
Okay, I'm just looking at this now
I've never come across this site before but it's telling me here that masterclass is Australian
$3.33 per month. Yeah, it's
Super expensive. It's super expensive and I I've watched a couple of them. This is the only one we watched all the way through
It's okay. I don't know. I'm probably maybe not even the right market for this kind of thing, but
It felt like a lot of
Things where you could just go and search it and find it online and see how to do it and not watch
I remember seeing an ad for it featuring Han Simmer and I kind of thought to myself how many people are out there
Aiming to become world famous film composers. It just seems a bit
It has a feeling of
We're gonna turn you into you know, the most famous person in this category
even though
And I found that to be first of all just super intimidating that it's like oh you're gonna learn
acting from you know, whoever's the the biggest name most accomplished actor ever it's like
Okay. I mean it's kind of cool on the one hand that there I think they're trying to make it accessible
but it just feels a little I don't know so anyways not not a
Not a promotion for masterclass by any stretch, but this dude is just awesome. You should check him out
I want to know he's bankrolling this plate this site that I'm just clicking through
They've got Gary Kasparov teaching chess
Okay. Now I've recently subscribed to a chess.com membership because my brother's gotten me addicted
I'm crap at chess. So I might need that one Mac OS 10 chess wasn't enough for you. No, I wasn't no no
Don't like that one. I've got Steph Curry teaching basketball
Like really I should well in my younger days. I would have enjoyed watching that you're into basketball on Joanne
Oh, totally. You should listen to NBL pocket podcast if you get the chance. It's great podcast
Yeah, wow, there's big names. No wonder it's $23 and 33 cents a month
Yeah, they got to pay all these people for the six hour videos that they make
But who is it? It must be a VC funded thing. Well, I
Got a question to ask you school lunches, okay
Obviously very different in the US from Australia
I know that but I feel like it could even be very different depending on the times that we grew up and
Where we lived even within Australia Andrew. Mm-hmm
I'm fascinated by this because my school lunch experience throughout school was probably more
Controversial than it needed to be and I want to know if you're kind of similar
Should I kick this off just before you start when you say school lunches?
Are you referring to lunches that are procured at the school or lunches that you bring?
To the school yourself or both
Both. All right, I'm gonna kick it off
Where do I even start? Okay, I'm just gonna tell you that I would say Vegemite is involved
I'm just gonna throw that out there
Fascinating you bring that up. Actually, that's a good point to start. I never took Vegemite sandwiches to school
Are you even Australian?
Do you know why?
Because the moment that you place any kind of sandwich within glad wrap and leave it in a bag for a few hours
The soggy factor explodes and what was once a delicious sandwich or Vegemite on toast has just lost all substance
Couldn't do it. So to this day I am disgusted by
Used glad wrap. It's one of my pet hates
I kind of pictured Martin as the one that has a locker that he opens and it has a nice jar of Vegemite in there
Somehow he's rigged up that there's a toaster in his locker with a bag of you know bread that he can make his fresh toast
Right there that just seems like fresh you
That yes, if I could have done that I would have you completely right, but there was no avenue or possibility to shove a toaster
Into a locker so not happening
Can just clarify as well. You mentioned glad wrap just for our American listeners. I think you're referring to
Saren wrap isn't that what they call that stuff? Is that what you call it?
Saran wrap. Yes
Yeah, yeah, I'm gas. It's not it's not a
a wartime agent it's just used to wrap sandwiches.
Well ours is called Glad Wrap.
Or Kling.
Is Kling just the more generic term?
Kling would just be generic.
Glad would just be the brand like a Kling situation.
Glad's the brand.
Well Glad is not promoting or sponsoring anything here don't worry about that.
And it kind of clicked at a young age that soggy sandwiches were not the thing.
I don't want this.
So as a youngster in primary school, I discovered that they sold tomato and cheese jaffles or
toasted sandwiches at the canteen.
And I thought, fantastic, I can have a hot toasted sandwich at the canteen.
Now I had about two or three of these a week at the cost of 90 Australian cents.
We're talking almost no money here.
And it was beautiful.
It was toasty.
It was delicious.
Parents actually approached my mother asking how she could possibly afford this, having
noticed through their voluntary canteen duties that I was ordering multiple sandwiches per
week.
Wow.
Food police.
Exactly.
And I thought, what kind of ridiculous situation is this that other parents are monitoring
another primary school child's lunches and the super expensive $2.70 sandwich combo at
school?
I don't know how this is a thing.
So later to remedy that, I often actually took cheese and crackers to school for lunch,
which made me even stranger.
So now they're just complaining like I don't think they're feeding him well.
It's like God, they've just sent him with a cheese board.
Was it a snack or was it separate cheese and crackers?
No, these were actually I took them wrapped in separate cheese and we're talking like
Jets or Ritz or stuff.
I did have something more substantial, but I just loved cheese on the biscuit.
Okay.
Did either of you have anything as eventful as this?
The sandwich you just mentioned you referred to it as a tomato and
cheese jaffle
Jaffle, okay, because previously on a different episode there was a
Something like a jaffer
Jaffa
Jaffa, that's a that's a lolly a lolly chocolate also an alien and stargazer sg-1
Okay, and now we have a jaffle. Could you maybe just tease that out? What is that?
Theoretically if someone didn't know what you were saying right now.
This is where my knowledge of culinary history may fall over so Andrew please jump in and
save me if I make a mistake.
But my understanding is that the jaffle comes from the jaffle maker and we're not just talking
about a flat iron sort of press like a sandwich press.
We're talking about a very specific one where you actually have grooves in the metal plate
that make like an auto cut large triangle sandwich.
Am I on the right track here?
And yeah, it seals the edges as well.
So you don't have to feel the edge around the outsides.
That's right.
So your cheese doesn't ooze out the risk there though, is that if you have something
like tomato, you're about to hit a pocket of hot lava in that thing.
Yeah.
So you need to puncture the bread or open a slight gap and avoid a steam
burn to enjoy your jaffle.
That's right.
Okay, cool.
That sounds great.
But always triangular.
What's the bread consistency on that?
Is that like a, like a, like a regular sandwich bread or is that more of like a
Crusty bread. What's the bread situation there? You would normally use white sliced loaf or wholemeal. Am I right?
Yeah, you want just a standard one to one thing cuz just yeah wonder what yeah
Okay, that crimps real nice on the edges
If you go out to a deli or some sort of fine European bakery and come home with this punnett a castle loaf and try
And shove that to be triangulated in a jaffa maker. That's not gonna work
Okay. Okay. I was a
Because I'm a bit older than you so I was a kid from in living in the 80s
so the great thing about living in the 80s was that nobody had allergies or
They just didn't give it didn't give a shit if somebody had allergies. They had they just ignored him entirely
Yeah, like no way Billy. We don't want to hear about it
Only the strongest shall survive. So I used to live on peanut butter and jam sandwiches. That was like my go-to
Nowadays at school kids aren't allowed to eat peanut butter
They can't take it. You can't take it peanut butter sandwich into the school because of peanut allergies
I'm saying hey just feed your kids peanut butter really young in life and they'll be fine
All right. How's that for a controversial take that sounds like a medical opinion to me then that's what we do here
So, yep, so I don't know how I'd survive in school these days and I feel sorry for my own kids
But nevertheless peanut butter and jam sandwiches was the thing if I was lucky enough to have money
for the canteen and that's
Like can't that's I don't know Jason. Do you know what a canteen is? That's kind of like the little shop that's run by
Yeah volunteers and mothers
Also known as tuck shop. Yep that I don't know and I used to get a my go-to
Was a crumbed sausage
Now I don't even think it really hard to find these days, but basically imagine like just like
processed meat
Processed ground meat and then it's covered in almost like a bread crummy sort of substance
Wow, that sounds like a miss like someone made a mistake and just went with it. Yeah, so it's a shitty snag
Yes, holy shit
Yeah, what a shitty snag?
nitty
Snag yeah, shnitty schnitzel snag sausage
So good. So yeah crumb sausage and you would get that and you wouldn't be deep-fried
I don't think I think it would be usually like baked put in a pie warmer or something for like a few hours
Were you eating American food lovingly sauteed?
This sounds like an American thing a processed meat dipped in a bunch of bread deep-fried shoved onto a stick
Served with it at four gallons of coca-cola
Well, then the problem was they would make you really thirsty. So you'd have to have a drink along with it
I think I think my drink I I if I had enough money
I might get a chalk milk or perhaps an orange see like which is basically a sweetened orange juice kind of option
Important question which chocolate milk was available
Well being WA it was
Masters was the
That's like WA milk. It's a very prestigious
Western Australian milk. Yeah, like a golf championship or something
They don't export it out to you lot. That was what I usually went with some kids would drink spearmint milk
I was never one to milk. Oh
Gross
Yeah, I thought that say
Spearmint that is horrific. No, it's a milkshake that brushes your teeth. Come on. Oh
It really is disgusting, but it's a delicacy in parts of Western Australia
And that comes pre-made in fact the company the company stopped making it for a while and there was such an outrage
Because it's a health hazard that they they were forced to bring it back because of the community action Wow
I'm glad to see that the biggest problems you have in Western Australia is that
Spearmint milk went away. Yeah
I will just say Mark, I agree with you. Sometimes if I got a sandwich from home that wasn't
peanut butter and jam, and it might be like cheese and tomato, there was nothing worse
than being excited about a cheese and tomato sandwich, but then it had been sitting around
for too long and your bread has just gone to mush and you'd take that bite.
And fold it on itself. Yeah, and you'd just be like, gag reflex
straight away. Horrible. Okay, another important question. Did
Did you ever have Devon and tomato sauce sandwiches?
Oh, you mean like polony?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Plenty of sauce.
That's a staple when I was there.
The primary school is a primary school lunch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I had nightmares as like a primary school kid that an entire platter of that was served
to me like among the glad wrap.
I'm not kidding.
Do you know what we're talking about, Jason?
Is that like baloney?
It was polony with a P. It's below the processed meat that he mentioned in the Schnitty Snack.
Oh, OK.
Got it.
Did you ever actually have like deli meat on sandwiches or was it always?
non meat sandwiches
Well in the 80s it it was all processed
Nowadays nowadays kids I hear kids like I've got kids my own now little primary school kids are rocking up with sushi
geez
Thanks to the real CN bar
So what what about you Jason? What's the what's the American did you I hang on before you answer?
You've watched enough American television. I'm sure you already know
If you got a tray and you're sliding the tray along and you're getting a jelly cup a little carton of milk
You're getting either a pizza macaroni cheese or maybe a burger and then you go and sitting down at a table
Maybe you sit with the cool kids. Maybe you sit with the nerds either way. There's probably gonna be a fight
Probably a food fight and you're all wearing different clothes for some reason
Yeah, um, wow, this is this caught me a little off-guard it I don't remember a lot of
The past like more than three years ago, but okay
So time frame wise younger school. I think it was very much pretty standard, you know, maybe a sandwich
Generally a meat-based sandwich ham turkey something like that
The regular accessories some kind of a beverage. I don't think I was never really a soda
Kid, I'm not a soda. I don't drink soda at all now
so I never it was always more of a juice or like a Gatorade some kind of a
Generic sports drink. Would you bring it to school in a little brown paper bag?
No, yes, usually brown paper bag and then have initially switched to or eventually switched to more of a reusable
Situation that had a little bit of insulation and one of those little cold ice like reusable ice thingies that you can refreeze
Was it termed a lunch box? I never really used a lunch box
Never had the box. Really? But a bag. What?
So you turned up with a disposable paper bag every day
For a while. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Wow, and then went to like an insulated bag thing
Yep, it was really like the pretty bunch. Yeah, did you ever made?
It was so wasteful how much crap we threw away in like the late 80s early 90s
So much there was the bag and then there was everything in the bag was in another bag
Right like a little zip bag or something like that and there was just so much waste
Did you put your lunch orders in on the morning of the school day through the family intercom?
No, no, usually the help just had it handled Wow
I'm kidding. There was no help
Before before I become that guy my mom just was yeah, here's your here's your lunch go ahead
That was about it later when school lunches were a thing
I would say it was probably,
I'm not fully remembering this,
but I would say it was probably 70/30
on bringing to purchasing at school.
I always remember lunches at school being super expensive
and not a good value at all for what you got.
It was always kind of the same crap
and I don't know why they charged what they charged.
It seemed like it should have been pennies,
but it was a hell of a lot.
So I think I generally would always bring food with me.
And then yeah, you go sit in a big open area.
I think I never really liked lunch at school.
It was like, why can't we just leave?
We should just leave.
As soon as it was possible for us to figure out how we could just leave campus without
anyone finding out, it was like, let's just get the hell out of here and go somewhere
else.
Well, I had that experience when I was on German exchange in high school.
On a particular day, everyone was just allowed to go and leave for some reason.
We went up and got these awesome German versions of Doner kebabs and I just went what is this place?
This is unbelievable way better than the pizza rounders that everyone was scoffing back at home. You know about pizza rounders you two
It's not like a bagel bite. I suppose it was just like filth put in made up pastry and sealed
Everyone else loved them. I thought they were disgusting delicious
Yeah, it was like I could spend X dollars on a crap thing at school
Or we could leave get the hell away from school for a while and go get something that was actually good
Did you have a thing that what was it sloppy something? What are they called?
I just sloppy Joe's right because in Australia
That's what you call a jumper or to you a sweater and I never understood why that
Huh, you know, you call a sweater a sloppy Joe. I've heard people caught here. I'm gonna look this up now. Oh
I'm with you now. Yeah jump. No, I'm not. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yep. I'm with you now jumper is a sloppy Joe. No
That's a food here. I love sloppy Joes. That's why that's my American heritage just sweater or the food the food
I'd love a sloppy
Yeah, if you type in sloppy Joe Australia you get things like sloppy Joe and pullovers men's women's kids bonds
That's sort of stuff. How did we diverge so much culturally that Americans are eating sloppy Joes and we're wearing them
Those two things just did not get the memo at some point. It went in completely opposite directions
Sloppy Joe like who poor Joe who was Joe that was wearing a sweater that he thought was nice
And then now he became sloppy Joe behind his back
And I just remember sloppy Joe's from Billy Madison that's like the thing that's stuck in my head
It's hard to beat a good sloppy Joe
Always if we would get that mum mum would that would sometimes be like Friday night dinner
At home and be like mom's making sloppy joes. Yes. Yeah awesome
And that's me an Australian kid with this weird slightly American heritage. So do you call them sweatpants or tracky decks?
They're tracking down. Thank you. I've been I've been I've been indoctrinated into the Australian ways by now
Yeah, yeah, Tracky Decks still say some words a bit weird though, but yeah, they're tracking decks
You've expanded your vernacular today Jason. You're right. Yeah
No, I'm I've just a lot to take in it at 5 a.m. You wear, you know, like probably a singlet tracky decks and pair of thongs
No, no
A wife beater
No, I would wear
Sandals, it would be the feet. What was the other one? You said there that was a
Singlet I said singlet but I could have gone with wife beater
Yeah, probably not that
As people still say that that's still seems horrific birth apparently
A
Tank top right is now what a singlet is is yeah
Yeah, no arms, right? Yeah
Well, I don't know. There's I'm that's a slight difference because there's the no arms
But then there's like the thin no arms, you know what I mean?
Like the single part on the shoulders is like the thin
Versus just seeing leaves being gone. Okay
Yes, single is probably thin.
Oh my gosh.
And then whatever the other one was is definitely not that.
It's probably sweatpants, I guess would be.
And under all that you'd have a pair of jocks.
Underwear?
Budgies, muddles, whatever.
That would be a fun game that you could say words and then I have to guess what they are.
We should do that sometime.
I mean, we do that pretty much every episode, I guess.
That's kind of what the show is, so.
That's why it's Hemispheric Views.
You guys bantering and I just looking blankly at the screen like "what the hell does that
mean?"
And now it's even more confusing because the Sloppy Joe is closed, so now I can't even
hone in on the category, because now the categories have gone against each other, so.
You're right, you're right, we do have our banter, but I feel like, Andrew, do you function
as kind of the intermediary or the translator in this situation?
I do feel a bit that way, yeah.
I sort of feel like I've got a foot in both camps or at least a pinky toe in Jason's camp
But what I'm hoping is that Jason what Jason's picking up from the two of us
I hope he's taking it out into the wider world. I want you to be talking to Valerie
I want you to be going outside so you know telling the kids to get off the front yard
You know that kind of thing. I use all your words all the time. I was gonna say your homework tomorrow is
Valerie tomorrow I'm heading to the server for a Chiquita
Oh
All I heard was I'm heading to the server for a Chiquita that sounded a bit more Mexican when you said
What is it would you say Chiquita or Chiquito
Chiquito like a Chiquito Andrew translate interpret. Come on. This is your job. Okay
Tomorrow Ivo that's tomorrow afternoon. Hey Andrew translate Chiquito
I'm going to the servo, which is the service station that also is like a little deli
mini supermarket
convenience store
Chiquito now that is a
Chocolate bar. Oh, I could be into that. But if I was going to the servo, I'd rather pick up a Chico roll
Oh the Chico roll
That might be better getting from that from the chippy. Yeah, you don't know how long the Chico rolls been sitting there at the server
Yeah, could be a problem.
Do you have 7-elevens there?
