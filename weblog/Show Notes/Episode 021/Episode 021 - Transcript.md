Speaking of sound, I hope, I am so hoping that I sound better than ever before.
Because I've done another upgrade.
Wait, is this not the sound panels though?
This is like beyond that even?
This is the sound panels.
Oh, okay.
No, no, no, it is the sound panels.
So I think this is a first for the podcast.
I think I might have talked about it on Discord.
this is the first real proper recording I've done with the sound panels in place.
And so I'm hoping that I just sound warm and rich, zero reverberation, fingers crossed.
To me you sound great.
Well it was a lot of fun, but do you know, have you guys ever installed these wall panels?
They're 600 mil square
Sorry 600 millimeters 60 centimeters
12 24 inches. Yep a lot of pressure to get them in the right spot and
You know so that because I've got two different colors alternating colors sort of an orange and a gray
And I've done checkerboard style on two opposite walls
But the pressure to get them all lined up was intense. Oh, yeah when they're that big every single millimeter
They're off. It just makes your skin crawl. Yeah, that was a family consultation. Yeah, I
Started off doing it myself and then I said Hannah. I need some help, please
And so we're in here with our measuring tapes and spirit levels. There you go
You know getting making sure it was all right
But then you once you commit you commit because it's got sticky back.
It's like 3M sticky back.
So you're sticking it on the wall.
So once you start sticking, you can't take it off and reposition.
You can.
Was it more nerve wracking or less nerve wracking than applying like an iPad screen protector?
It's a good comparison.
Less nerve wracking than an iPad screen protector.
Really?
Yeah.
You're right.
Those things freak me out because if you get a bubble.
Oh yeah, there's no risk of bubbles in the wall.
No, no.
I was the guy people came to when I used to work at the Apple reseller in Wollongong years
ago.
Someone would say, "I want a screen protector for my iPad or my iPhone or something," and
the staff member would look at them and then just turn to me and say, "Martin?"
And I'm like, "Okay."
And then they would come and they would stand over you like an audience member.
And I recall a number of times saying, "I respect that you want to watch this, but it's
much better if you stand aside.
They're like, "Oh, no worries."
Then they'd toddle off.
Do you have rules of engagement with your phones?
Like a certain method where it lives in a certain pocket at a certain position, that
kind of thing?
You know when you see those old iPhone ads where it's like it comes up and it's got the
jingle and they're demonstrating how to use it?
I feel like that's how I look like when I'm using it.
I don't just pull it out of my pocket, it's considered I am now putting my hand in pocket,
grasping the phone, pulling out.
So I've never broken one.
I think I've had one scratch on, like you said Jason, the 11 Pro, and I'm just a bit
obsessive about it.
It doesn't ruin my day, I don't overthink it, but it's like I've taken on habitually
Apple advertisement grabbing of said handset.
Mine is right pocket, which I think probably just whatever if you're right-handed or left-handed
I would imagine dictates what pocket it goes in.
Although I'm curious if you're right-handed or left-handed, does that go for phone too?
Are you both right-handed?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's the right pocket.
Yeah, so right pocket.
Mine goes in my left pocket.
Interesting.
Do you use it with your left hand or do you do like a pick out and then hand swap?
No, it's a left-handed sort of thing.
Wow.
Well that, I think...
Just consider you are reaching across your own torso to remove a gun from a holster or something.
No, no, so it's left pocket, it's in the left pocket.
Okay.
And pull it out with the left hand.
And you're just kinda, you're just left-handed?
Just using my left hand, yeah.
Wow.
Where are your keys?
Right pocket.
Good, okay, so they're not jingling together.
Oh no, no, no.
Are you a one one thumb typer or a two thumb type two thumb?
So then I'll I'll put it pretty I'll sort of have it in the middle if I'm doing that
thing
So you pull your phone out with your left hand you open up your browser you go to hemispheric views calm and see what's new
And like you're just scrolling with your left thumb and then yep
If you're gonna get like really into that web page, you're like wow
Really want to look at all this stuff. Do you ever do like find yourself doing a hand swap?
Cuz like the right dominant hand is just more precise at scrolling
No, I don't think so. I think my right my left hand is better. I also throw a freeze
I throw a frisbee left-handed as well. Maybe that's got something to do with it. So you're left-handed
You just haven't really come to terms with that
But I write and play basketball with my right hand. So
They're the two dominant other features of my life. Do you tweet about basketball with one hand?
Because I saw a few tweets before that's that that's - that's - finger
I'm smashing those out in timeouts. I'm working fast on those or a little break to play
You got to type fast with those guys sometimes even dictate
And what are they doing over there in Western Australia? I got it. Yeah, you guys do in both hands. That's that's great
I'm gonna I'm having a crisis of confidence now because I'm wondering if I'm leading you all astray
I'm gonna start self-analyzing you should I would but it's definitely left pocket
Okay, so left pocket it's it's screen in I think that seems to make the most sense to me because if you pull out your
Phone you're looking at the back
Although you wouldn't really know it because both sides feel the same now
So it wouldn't be the first time I pulled my phone out of my pocket and somehow I put it in backwards and I'm looking
at the back very confused
And then you're like damn it and you're freaking out that you may have done something to your screen the entire time
it's been the wrong way in exactly and
and then I guess just top down so when you pull it out it's the correct way.
I guess there's not really a whole lot of ways to do that.
But isn't it interesting with the phones, so everyone, well everyone, most people prefer the way that it's gone back to the flat sandwich kind of design.
But everyone hates universally the Apple TV Siri remote which is designed with the same idea in mind.
Have either of you pulled your phone out the wrong way or off a table the wrong way?
Yes. Yes. I have. Yeah. It's happened to me. And I suppose so. I don't know. I don't really care.
Well, it's not the end of the world. It's just I've listened to a bunch of podcasts over the years and
people bring up the Siri remote. No, but if you get the Siri remote the wrong way around,
it's bloody annoying. Yeah. And you start swishing around on the bottom of it.
I find them every once in a while I'll pick up the Siri remote the wrong way but for the most part I find the two distinctive edges to be enough to cue me which way it's supposed to go like the the matte kind of uh the matte side which is the trackpad side and then the shiny uh shiny glass side but I'm too scared to touch any of it so I never get to feel that because I don't know if I touch the wrong side I'm gonna stop my video or
Is it on TV with white gloves on? Yes, and if you exit out that prime video app
Do you know how long it takes for that thing to load again?
It's bad news. The prime video app is the one that always just sits there and is like hey, I'm still here. I'm like
Okay
See you're still there
Even with your superfast internet you have to wait 30 seconds for it to validate or whatever it does. Yeah, right
They're not they're not the best written apps for sure
I better start building up my tolerance for this trip to Australia because this is just
going to be wild.
I guess my vocabulary I should be working on more than anything.
It sounds like.
You picked up on the hard yakka the other day, didn't you?
On micro.blog.
Yeah, that was a heck of a sentence, I've got to say.
Did that make sense to you?
I mean, I wish I had it in front of me so I could analyze it again.
Think it mostly made sense
because there was a
There was a person you were referring to as the the person who was working on something
That would be the tradie the tradie which sounds like a trades person. So I picked up on that. Got it tradie
Well done training is paying off. He's he's learning isn't he Martin?
I forget what else there was in there. There was another word
Okay, so there was I've got it here I could tell you it's give the tradie
Who's been doing hard yakka?
in your yard all day I
Should have said a bit. I should have said a bevy but I said a beer
At the end of it
Funny, I actually say bevy
But I don't know why not for any reason that's related to anything with you guys, but that's interesting. Yeah. Yeah
Yaka? Yaka. Yep. Just sounds like shitty work, like something you don't want to do. Well done.
Like digging a hole. That's when you smash down a VB. Those ads are full of hard yakka.
But not the boots hard yakka, just the general colloquial term hard yakka.
I'm really impressed, Jason. You have come so far, like in just a short period of time.
Keep this up and you'll be an honorary citizen. This is really good work.
I'm trying. Yeah, I'm working on it. It's like learning a new language, except it's the same
one. It's like a variant, I guess. Yeah. You'll be ready for when you arrive and you can stand
across circular key with your shrimp on the barbie. Prawn. That's prawn. We say prawn here.
Okay. I apologize.
It's gonna be great. You'll be welcome. You won't want to leave
This is hemispheric views episode 21
we're
we're doing something a little different because
We don't have an agenda. And so what you're hearing is whatever pops up into our mind. It's like a
new age
podcasting experiment
One might say so I have three dots in my note
For for today, so that's a topic. That's a start
I did cheat. I actually thought of a couple of things
That I wanted to mention I couldn't help. I couldn't have a blank sheet of paper. I just couldn't do it
Let's burn through them all right now so you have nothing left.
What are they Andrew?
Go.
Go.
Number one.
Point one.
Point one.
Okay, point one.
Point one.
The most important point is gentlemen, we have more coffees coming
through.
Yes.
No, people are listening and giving money.
They are.
They are more coffee.
More coffee bought for us.
So kind.
I want to say a big thank you to John Payne.
John Payne again.
These people are not satisfied with buying as a single coffee.
They we are buying getting coffee bought for us in bulk.
John Payne gave us $30.
$30.
10 10 coffees.
You would think that I was being nefarious in some way and made the page only allow the number 10 in there.
I joked about that.
I didn't actually do it though.
It still defaults to one.
So this is something that is being done on purpose.
It's amazing.
So thank you, John.
Um, I hope now after spending, spending $30, 10 coffees on us,
after hearing our last well-produced, you know, itemized, well-planned out
podcast, you're not getting this one, which is just like random guff and
thinking, what have I invested my money in?
I'm wondering why I joined the call.
I made a giant mistake.
Thanks Martin.
This was your idea.
What am I doing?
Oh yeah.
Martin said, "Hey, I've got an idea. We always seem to have really good chat after the show.
Why don't we just make that the whole show?" Yeah, it was my fault. I accept that.
Sorry, Mr. CFO. And now we've actually been staring at each other for three hours just
waiting to think of something to say. So, and look, we've fallen back to my agenda items.
We actually have no rapport whatsoever.
Well, point two.
All right, okay, chop chop.
I saw a really cool video just a couple of hours ago.
Probably everybody on the internet has or will have seen this over the next few days,
but it was the Mars Perseverance landing.
Yes.
I'll put the link in the show notes, but it is super cool and almost amazing that it seems
kind of like, "Hey, good job!" Like... - That blows my mind. We watched it live. - You have to stop
and think you are putting something man-made on another planet! - Well not even that, but like
landing it, getting it there is one thing. You could just shoot something and like hit the planet,
I guess. Not that that's even easy, but to get the level of precision and automation required
to get something from here to there that you can't interact with while it's doing this.
It just has to work is monumental. And yes, to your point, it was kind of,
it was a tweet in today's world. And that was it. Like it was, it was as if doing the moon landing
today would have been, you know, NASA saying man on moon period, spaceman emoji, exclamation point.
And then that was it and it was like yep man on the okay cool
It is insane
how amazing this achievement is and how
seemingly
Lost in the new I don't even know if it was even
In the news really. I mean, yes, there's a lot of other stuff going on in the world right now, but
It seems like we could kind of take a minute to just say
Well done. Holy shit. That is amazing
Maybe you two can clear something up for me here because it is amazing. I was watching and thought
this is unbelievable but for every tweet that contained a video or something there seemed to
be 500 people underneath it saying "fake fake fake fake fake fake" or "this audio is fake".
Was any part of it fake or were there different versions flying around? Because I had trouble
keeping track. I don't know if you've noticed the United States for the last five years.
but I wasn't sure I didn't want to jump to conclusions there are how to see how
can I how can I phrase this there are a lot of people in the world I guess would
be the best way to say that I was gonna go with unenlightened but yeah okay we
can run with yeah I mean unenlightened that just that's just who they are they
They just want everything to be ruined.
And they all came out of the woodwork over the last five years and gotten powered.
And now it's just everything.
I saw something even yesterday that people are now apparently snow is a conspiracy theory
that snow is not real or something.
And I'm just like, what in the actual is happening in this world?
I don't understand.
You know, having a little healthy skepticism, sure, but like, give me a break.
Who are you?
Are they claiming that like at Australian ski resorts when you have an off year they
get the big snow guns out and pretend that it's fresh powder?
Is that what they're claiming?
No, this is even worse than that.
That at least you're like, yeah, people make snow because they don't have enough snow.
It makes sense.
Sure.
This is just like another level of what the hell is what is happening.
But to your point, yes, that's just a thing now that I guess we have to deal with and
is never going to go away.
Well, this is part of what made the Mars landing so much so fun or so relieving, I guess, in
that these projects don't just happen overnight.
This has been going on for years.
And I sort of thought they've been working on these good, smart, intelligent people have
been working on this throughout this entire Trump era politics.
smart people getting on with doing smart things and it kind of gives you some
hope for the world. It's like yes as much as we hear about all the fruit loops
there are some good people who are really clever and yeah still doing great
things for humanity. And through COVID too right? Like we were talking last time
about jobs that required being in the same place. I can't think I mean this is
one of them where you need to have all these people in a room writing crap on a
board and challenging each other or else this is not gonna work and they did all
that through I'm sure it delayed the hell out of it I would imagine well I
know it did because you could see in the background everything said Mars 2020 on
all the you know signage and everything which I also was wondering if I'm sure
it wasn't an oversight. Obviously people saw every day that the wall said 2020 and we're
well into 2021. But at some point that had to have been a conscious decision to say,
for whatever reason, no, we're leaving it as that, as a kind of reminder that some stuff
happened and we still got there. I'm assuming, I don't know that, but in my head I have to
imagine that there was a little bit of that going on.
Or they exhausted their budget and couldn't spend anything on any more signs
That's the second part which is like no one could even go down to Staples and get a new sign for eight bucks
But I like to think it's the positive one. I
Do hope I do hope the the perseverance rover didn't take along with a little vial of
Coronavirus just
Did really cross cross pollinate
Planets and did you see the little helicopter to the little drone thing? How cool is that? That's even better
It's like we've had rovers before now. There's a little tiny helicopter machine flying around. That's just nuts
It is bonkers. Is that manufactured by DJI? Is there a bit of a American Chinese?
Corporation going on there. I don't I mean does anyone else make drones?
I think DJI is the only one that makes them now, right?
So it has to be but imagine how much that drone costs
So you have like a like a normal drone from DJI that's like, I don't know three four five hundred dollars
The I would love to see the the final bill for how much this one little
Helicopter costs from R&D to design to materials. I would bet that's probably like a billion dollar
Little drone that they have there
Probably has worse quality cameras than the one on the DJI. I
Have a question about ties actually Andrew you strike me as a person I don't mean this in any way as offensive
It's actually impressive you strike me as someone who enjoys or is more tolerant of wearing a tie
Oh, he loves a tie. He loves a tie
There's no way anybody that's got a left phone pocket is a Thai guy
You're a tiger I used to be it. I'm not these days because nobody wears ties anymore unless you go to court
And I try and stay out of court as much as possible
but no I was I was a big Thai guy like I remember when I was in high school, and it was a
private school so it was wear a uniform and part of the uniform was a tie and
I took pleasure in ensuring that my tie was exactly right and I would keep it exactly right throughout the entire day
Even if I was playing sport at lunchtime, I would at the end of that sport session fix
up the tie.
There was always pride in making sure it was just at the right point of the length, so
it would just hit the belt buckle, just be within that belt buckle range.
And then I went to work after uni, and then I went to work proper, and I got to wear a
tie every day, and I thought it was sensational.
Loved it.
Wow.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and assume that since you're a left phone person, you
would be the person that would have the jacket pocket, you'd keep your phone in there instead
of a normal pocket like a normal person.
You'd be the suit guy where you'd have to open the suit, get it out of the thing.
If I'm wearing a suit, yeah, there's still a lot of times I will put it in that breast
pocket.
Where were the business cards?
Where did they go?
They go in the breast pocket too, or perhaps in the business shirt, chest breast pocket.
Power move.
on if you think your jacket's gonna be coming off but you still need ready
access to the cards because you never want to get caught without a card.
Right now suit pants, suit pants are quite soft and they can show you know items like
keys and stuff pretty easily through them. Where did the wallet go? Was the
wallet in a front pocket or were you sitting on it and throwing off your spine?
No the wallet would either go in my breast pocket as well which would maybe
be a reconfiguration of the phone situation.
You never want stuff were you carrying in the breast pockets? Well, I know this is the problem, right?
So this is where you have to switch to a briefcase slash bag. Oh
You had little gold code things
He totally did I did at one point in my life. I do not lie. I do not kid
What was the code? What was your what was your three-digit code?
Can't remember
Zero zero zero
No, I do know what it was. It was the um
It was the phone number of the pizza delivery shop that I used to work for Wow, okay
That were you making pizzas delivering them? What was I was in it? I was everything in the pizza delivery world
I could do it. I could do it all I
Would I would make I would wash dishes. I would deliver
I was this like a chain kind of pizza place or was this a mom-and-pop kind of
Lone wolf pizza place. No, it was a chain. It was it was a good Australian chain that then got bought out by a giant
ginormous chain of can we can we cause some Australian controversy and say what this wonderful pizza chain was
Sure, I don't think there's any I think I'm
outside of any
Yeah
Restraint of trade
Restrictions on this. I think I can I think I can name them. They started off as Silvio's
Pizza and then they transition they were sold out and they became dominoes. Oh
Yeah
Yeah, I think I've heard that name
Yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't they were high quality when I was involved since I've left
I've just seen them just go downhill just the quality control isn't there anymore
Given that original high quality were you wearing a tie there - no I was wearing it
I was wearing a polo that had a couple of reflective bits on it
For safety when you were delivering at night. Were you on a bicycle or a motorbike or in a car?
Oh, please be a motorbike. No, no, I can't ride a motorbike. I was in a I was in a
Generally my own car which started off as a Holden Gemini
And then moved on to a Nissan Bluebird the affirmation one. We know what happened with the Bluebird. Yes. Yes
The door of the Bluebird. This is while it still had four working doors
Most of the work was done in the Holden Gemini.
That reminds me of over here. We had the Lone Star Steakhouse for a short period of time.
And they built them everywhere. The peanuts. They built them everywhere.
And they built them, like you say, in a very distinctive style.
You used to go in there and you could sit there before your meal or around the bar area.
It was a family-friendly sort of restaurant. They still run. You can take your kids there.
Oh, you'd eat peanuts and throw them on the floor.
I'm on the floor, but then that became a work health and safety hazard. You couldn't do it anymore
That's it. That doesn't seem no more peanuts. I doesn't seem unsafe
Well, Natasha and I hadn't seen one for years and we went to Adelaide in South Australia and saw Lone Star and went
Oh my goodness
They still exist and we went in there and said we know it's way too late for lunch and way too early for dinner
But do you have the peanuts and they said?
Yes
Do you want some and we said yeah, we just want to have some peanuts
They said well the policy is you have to buy a drink and we said okay
We'll have a drink and then they gave us a bucket of peanuts and we just sat there having afternoon tea
Deshelling things it's great. We thought they were gone. I hope you didn't throw them on the floor though
No, sure. I'm way too compliant as we've discovered. Yes, they just walk up and there's just a little thing of shells around his chair
They're like, what do you what do you oh, you can't do this anymore?
Oh, so no you can't but you and the family go Andrew to Lone Star
Yeah, no, it's not there anymore
It's long. I thought you said there was one. No, they're the building because they had that um that distinctive building design
So I look at it now and I still see it as a Lone Star even though it's some other random restaurant
But it's very that very distinctive building because you know what I miss I miss sizzler you you actually
Wait eat. Where else do you get cheese toast at home?
I've never heard anyone say the sentence "I miss Sizzler". I didn't say it was good. I just said it was memorable
But I remember the last time we went there before it closed in South Sydney
We're on our way to the Opera House for a concert. So get that contrast right?
We're off to the Sydney Opera House for a concert. We stopped by Sizzler for some cheese toast. It was a very memorable evening
five years ago
Were you wearing a tie? We were very well dressed. I wasn't but Andrew would have been had he been there
What a black tie for that sort of event. I don't think there's a worse piece of clothing than a tie
I'll just say that now. I think it's it's useless
fairly obvious anyone that remotely knows anything about me knows that I'm very and and
tie and tie tie I
Hate ties, whatever you want to call it
I'm so old get this right. I was at the local IGA grocery store the other day
I've lived in this region this area for about 12 years now
So I've been here a long time and I remember the bad old days of that IGA grocery store. It was terrible
New people bought it over the last few years. They've really invested in it. They've it's great now really good stuff. You can actually buy and
Eat the fruit and veg that they sell which is a huge step up from what it used to be
Wow, that sounds like a pretty pretty low bar for a grocery store. It was terrible, but
consume and
I'm anyway. I am so old that I saw the gentleman owner
Loading some fruit and I stopped with my little basket of goods as excuse me
Just want to say thank you for making this a really great idea
I said I've lived here a long time used to be terrible now. It's wonderful. Thank you for all the effort that you put in and
So that confirmed that I'm an old man because I'm just going up and like randomly talking to
store owners
Out of the blue, but you should have seen the look of the look of happiness that came over his eyes
He was like, ah for once I don't have set. Yeah, it's like you're not Karen and you're not complaining. It's like
You want to speak to the manager just because you want to say something nice
Andrew as different as we are I fear that we've we're essentially the same person. I
I will take any excuse to talk to someone in a server situation.
I didn't used to be this way. This is a new thing for me and I'm really enjoying the experience.
Oh, you've grown into the role.
Oh, I used to be a complete, I was so shy and um, um, what's the, what's the word they use
for when people don't want to talk and they stick to themselves?
Me.
What reserved or somewhat introverted?
Introvert, thank you. That's the word I was stuck with. Yes. I was a massive introvert really shy introverts. I would never spoken out of turn
But now I'm all about the random chats. Do you find yourself?
Fighting your own will to speak like you want to speak, but you can now I shouldn't I do now
Yeah, I don't know what's happened to me. Yeah, welcome to my world. Although somehow I got there from birth
poor Natasha, oh
Oh yeah, but she sucked into it now. To give you an idea of what I was raised around, my
grandfather, who I've mentioned before, I remember shopping with him at a grocery shop,
as is the Kenyan tradition, and we went through, and he would do this stuff all the time,
we went through the checkout and the young woman behind the counter had a name badge on,
as is generally the custom, and he turned to her after she had finished packing the bags,
the grocery bags. And he said, just something your name tag there love. It's is that Mario Marie,
because Mario is becoming an increasingly common pronunciation. And she looked at him and
it's Marie. Oh, thank you. Have a good day. And we totaled off. That was my
let's engage about the pronunciation of this person's name. And I used to actually
greet people at the checkouts by their name, just to see that moment of shock when they went,
how do you know me?" and then they'd look down at their badge. Clearly you two didn't have this
experience growing up. Wow there's a lot going on there. I think both of these stories fully explain
the two people you are today for sure.
Just the other day somebody, we had some food delivered and I, they, now because of all this,
you know, everything. They just kind of stick it on the porch and run away because, you know,
don't get near me. Totally understandable. But I knew they were coming and I heard them and I,
you know, they set it down. I let them kind of walk away a bit. I opened the door and said,
you know, thanks. Have a good night. And you could just tell that the lady was very
caught off guard. She was just kind of like, first of all, what did he say? Is he screaming?
It felt like you could just you expect that she's expecting someone to open the door and start screaming about their order or something
It was just like no just
Saying thank you
She was very
Took a while and then was like. Oh, yeah you uh, you you too. We
And then click left
I think I think in america they generally say yeah, thanks. Can I have that compliment in the form of a tip, please?
That already happened. So we're we were good on that that that was a pre which is weird too when
you do food ordering because you tip before anything even happens they don't even know
they're getting the order yet but here we are. I actually had a delivery experience today. I
thought of you Jason because it was a package delivery from Star Trek who I think is owned
by Australia Post actually. They're a logistics company and they delivered something at the
door today.
He's not speaking about the TV show so we don't need any emails about Star Trek vs.
Star Trek.
Yes, completely.
Just clearing that up now. Go ahead.
Good point. And the guy rang the doorbell and the door was open, just the screen door
was closed. So I was just inside, I popped out and said, "Hey, how you going? Thanks
for that." And he said, "Yep, no worries. I'm just, just leave you here. I've just
got to take a photo of it." He's like, "It's funny, you know, this one, I don't
need you to sign for it, but yesterday I delivered that one and you needed to sign for that one.
It's like, you just never know what you're going to get." And I was like, "Oh, cheers.
No worries, mate. Have a good day." He's like, "Yep, will do." And he toddled off
And it was like, and I thought that is a typical Australian delivery exchange.
To me, that didn't seem anything out of the ordinary.
It was totally normal.
And I just thought, how would that go in Jason's world?
Would that be totally unusual?
Because all I ever see of deliveries in America is what I see on Reddit, which is essentially
camera footage from people's doors as delivery guys basically throw a fastball pitch of the
package at the door. Whereas this guy was... and it's not unusual. This is what you would
expect in a show. That guy comes in, places it carefully down, does what he has to do on his
little iPhone computer thingy-me-bob, and you have a little pleasant exchange.
Yeah, usually here they'll get a good piece of probably half-inch rope. They'll like douse it
in kerosene, take your package, wrap it around probably like a brick, maybe a cinder block
if they're feeling real good that day, get a good tight knot on it, then light said rope
on fire from the kerosene and then huck it at your front door and if it doesn't quite
hit hard enough they'll go pick it up again, take a few steps back, get a good wind up
and then huck it again and then they'll take a photo and then leave.
That's pretty much it.
And you open the door and compliment them.
You say thank you.
And give them money.
Yeah, and then they give you the finger and drive off in their diesel truck.
I told you two guys before that our postman or delivery guy dances at the front door to
our doorbell.
So clearly we are worlds apart.
This is very strange.
We usually have pretty good luck.
It depends, you'll kind of usually get the same person.
I don't know if that's the same there,
but usually there's like, you know,
that's the FedEx lady or that's the UPS guy or whatever.
And at our last house where we used to live,
our UPS guy was the best.
He was just the nicest guy, chat with him, you know,
totally fine.
And then my first experience when we moved here,
we were getting a bunch of crap delivered
'cause we just moved in.
So there's always like, oh, we don't have this,
quick get a delivery, but it's usually big things,
like a big bed thing or a big furniture item or something.
And I guess FedEx is generally how these places
ship stuff that's huge.
And this lady could not hate us anymore.
She would show up and just be already pissed off,
usually not wearing, speaking of uniforms,
didn't even have her FedEx clothes on.
And she was just very upset.
And every time it'd be some huge ass thing.
And I'd be like, Oh God, yeah, thank you.
You know, trying to smooth it over a little bit and just say, you know, it's fine.
And at one point you, she just got in the truck and looked down at me.
Like, are you going to get this out of the truck?
And I was like, I do.
I mean, do you need a hand?
I I'm I can help you.
Cause she's grumbling, kicking stuff out of the way.
like, "I can't believe they're making me deliver all this stuff by myself and everything."
And I'm like, "I'm not FedEx, first of all. I didn't assign you to take all this crap,
but I don't think technically I'm even legally allowed to help you, probably?
There's some kind of workplace safety thing that I would have to imagine,
says a customer cannot get into the FedEx truck and lift a heavy box."
I mean, maybe I should have. Maybe be, you know, extra retired now.
But she was very mad and every time,
at one point she was like,
"You guys sure order a lot of big stuff."
- She had a go at you.
- I was like, "I'm sorry I bought things
"that made you do your work.
"What do you want me to say to that?
"Like sorry I consumed a good
"that provided business to FedEx?
"If I had my choice, I would have picked UPS
"'cause you guys are always late."
But, you know, she was very mad and there was no smoothing her over.
They also wear uniforms.
She knows that they're employees.
She did not.
Most of the time she never, she was just in like regular clothes.
It was very weird.
The whole thing was very strange.
Maybe she never actually worked there and she just had like one of those,
like had like another personality and she would wake up one day, just hop in
the closest FedEx truck and go deliver stuff.
I don't know.
Could be.
Jason do you at the Apple stores that you visited across the United States have you ever
Come across people in random fits of applause
We haven't seen that in Australia
Like clapping Apple store employees, I mean on like iPhone day
Yeah, that's all happening all the time for sure on like a normal day. Oh, so store openings
Yes, and and product release days. Yes
Other than that, no, how do you feel about the clapping culture? I'm glad I don't have to do it. I
Mean I I don't I don't think I have a strong opinion one way or the other I think they're having fun
So as long as I had my pre-order in on time, I'm clapping too
It sort of reminds me going back to the Lone Star Steakhouse when every 45 minutes or whatever. They would do that dance
Love the dance yeah, I think a birthday dance. I don't think the staff love the dance. No it wasn't even a birthday dance
It was just like the clock strikes the hour and so here we go
We got to do some boot scooting the music would get louder
The staff would all line up they do a boot scoot
And then it would be you know one minute past the hour and suddenly music get down and everybody back to normal
Like it never happened. It was hourly cotton-eyed Joe. That's what it was like
And I feel that's what like the Apple store is like when they do the clapping. It's like nobody really wants it
we're just doing it because we kind of have to and it's
cheesy as all get out and
Can it please be one minute past the hour so we can stop I wonder how many people were hired
At that place, but they just never mentioned that part, right?
Like you're going through the thing and you're like, okay. Yep. I got to do the I'm the the drink person or whatever
Like, "Yep, I think everything looks good here. He signed on the line. Your first day is Monday. Okay, cool. Cool. Yep. All right, come in."
And then they're like, "All right, you're ready for the dance, right? We're gonna do the dance now."
And they're just like frozen with fear, like, "What are you talking about dance?"
And then it happens and they go, "Wow, glad we got that out of the way. Oh, by the way, that'll be eight times during your shift."
Like, oh shit.
What have I signed up for? I did not know that this was gonna be a thing.
I'm personally more confused by Australians who willingly work at Outback Steakhouse.
Oh, that's a good question. So those clearly they must exist there, I would imagine, right?
They keep coming and then going out of business around these parts.
I find it a bizarre business proposition that Australians would even buy. I don't understand.
It's so strange that I don't know the backstory of Outback Steakhouse,
So I don't even know if, if it started there or if it was just like a stupid
thing that happened in maybe the U S and somebody just co-opted out back as a
catchy thing, but yeah, that does seem really bizarre that those would even a
exist in Australia because who living in Australia is going to eat there.
I would think probably not very many people.
So then you're banking on people visiting and tourists to eat there, but.
who the hell wants to eat there anyway? I've just offended all six of our Outback Steakhouse
listeners. But that does seem very weird. It feels like it's akin to us having like a,
I don't know, you know, shitty American food restaurant here. And it's like, oh, I'm going
to go down to the crappy American food restaurant. It's like, what's the name of the restaurant? No,
No, that's the name of it. That's what it's called. Oh, okay
And that is very weird. Yeah Outback Steakhouse. Mm-hmm, but they do have the the that onion thing
The Bloomin onion no one has ever said that seriously in this country
no, and I don't remember if it's that one or the other one because there's there's the Bloomin onion and then there's the
What's the other one called there's another restaurant that has an onion that's similar to the Bloomin onion
But they call it something else someone might call it a bloody onion, but no one's gonna buy that
that. That's just the Bloomin' Onion with hot sauce on it. So you guys are not big
Outback Steakhouse fans clearly? I just don't understand why people would go to
eat somewhere that looks vaguely like a stereotypical Outback poster somewhere
in a regional coastal city or capital city that doesn't even look like that
and then order something called Alice Springs chicken. I just don't know. It
doesn't make any sense. Did you try throwing peanuts on the floor? Maybe that
would heighten the experience. It certainly trip someone over that could
improve it I don't know. Wait outback no outback outback is fine
what's down under nobody says that right? No okay never. Couldn't remember if it was
outback or down under. Don't come here and say hey I'm down under. I don't I
don't understand what I'm down under what am I under? I don't. Yourself where
you were. I guess so. You're under yourself. So yeah, that's why we don't say it, because
we didn't come up with it. At least as far as I know. Like, we're down under ourselves?
That's a bit weird. Yeah, no. Okay. So no on that and no on Outback Steakhouse. That's
right. But the word Outback is fine. It's not something that I personally use a lot,
but it is a thing. You can say "in the Outback." Just no one eats onions out there. You'd more
likely just say, "I'm going bush." Yeah, go on bush. You can say that. I like that. Go
of the country. No, I like going bush. That's better. You don't have to settle with one.
There are options. Well, speaking of things you can buy, I believe Hemisphere Reviews has a store.
Yes, we have ties. We have suits and uniforms. And we so no, we don't. We actually have three
things. We have stickers. We still have stickers available. Supply is dwindling,
but they're still available. An excellent artwork one which you may have seen online,
people posting photos of that. We have the circular sticker still available. I'm turning
sideways to check my stock because I have stock within view. We also might have t-shirts soon,
potentially, which are the two street signs that you may have seen on hemisphericviews.com.
And then we also have full
Four foot by six foot flags of the felled foot available for a pre-order
Don't make promises you can't keep or the foot will come down. Oh, I'll keep that promise somebody wants to order that I
Will make it happen
Tell you what my sister loved that
Apparently everyone related to it who she knows
But look for listeners who are kindly buying stuff whether it's a genuine sticker a lovely shirt or a
Make-believe or perhaps very soon to be realized flag of me oppressing everyone I care about
Where are you gonna put it? You're gonna put it in the public discord at hemispheric V on Twitter micro blog
Don't forget to show it off. That's important. That's a condition right? Am I enforcing that as the felt? I think so
Yeah, you must do this. Yeah at the very least you should walk into any store slash establishment bother someone
That's working there to show them and have a conversation about it. I wanted I want a t-shirt and a flag. I
Just want the flag so I can burn it but you know, I want the t-shirt to keep and wear
