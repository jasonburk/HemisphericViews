Normally when we swap our hemispheric views each episode, we follow some sort of agenda. Well, this time, we thought that we'd try something different: _WE THREW THE AGENDA OUT THE WINDOW._ Do we actually know how to talk to each other? You'll find out! As a result, Andrew fondly recalls how he used to wear ties, Jason marvels at the Mars mission and Martin shares memories of throwing peanuts on the floor.
