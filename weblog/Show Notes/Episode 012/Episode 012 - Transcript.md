From Gabriel, we have another one. I think he sent one photo.
Yes, thank you Gabriel for sending it. Let's have a look.
I think he was the first one to send it and he was a little bit begrudgingly sending it, but I have to say...
Because he heard us speak about the other ones.
Yeah, I mean that's a fair point. After hearing that I'd be like, "Nope, not sending that in."
I want to, sorry, I have to jump in and address the elephant in the room in this photo, since
Andrew has been so vocal recently about certain types of accessory.
How are you feeling about the backpack in the foreground?
Well I'm glad you brought that up because unlike certain Scrooges on the podcast, I
love a backpack and I have been in a lifelong search for the perfect backpack.
That's why I hate them!
And.
Because so have I!
And this one is the perfect backpack.
It is sitting next to me right now on the wall next to my desk.
So already huge points for having the best backpack ever.
What is it?
It's the Peak Design Everyday Backpack.
This is the, I believe this is version one.
There's a version two now.
I also have the version one, but it is the best backpack ever made, full stop.
I'm a little concerned, you know, we're speaking about ergonomics and such.
I'm a little concerned that all of his plugs are down on the floor.
Is that an Apple watch charger or no, is that just an extension cord?
The thing with the white disc?
That is an Apple watch charger on the side there with then the monitors
plugged in down there as well.
I just feel like they got, we got to get him a power strip to put up above
because you can't be climbing around on the floor to plug stuff in.
Is that a Dalek on the floor?
What is that?
That's exactly my question.
So that brings me to my next point that I believe it is.
And I'm a little concerned that a, they have little tiny ones now.
And B it's just under his desk as if that's fine.
That's what we do here.
So I think you might want to take care of that because that seems dangerous.
You may be exterminated.
He's actually not in that photo.
So maybe he has been exterminated.
Or his chair has, because he doesn't have a chair either.
So I'm like, they're making him crawl around on the ground to plug stuff in.
They don't give him a chair.
What's going on here?
He has to keep his Apple watch on the floor next to a Dalek.
Yeah.
In a minute.
Just that's, that's workplace safety.
That's, that's a lot of issues right there.
So get that taken care of.
Uh, at least he's near an exit.
That's all right.
Yeah, no, that's a good point.
And I'm curious if he has any type of plan, because I would, of a means of getting that
desk, the desk walls, pushed down as fast as possible so you can go walls shoot away
from you and then you can just rock it right out the door.
Once we've pushed all of the walls aside, what happens to all of these figurines?
I have to say it is meticulously arranged and he even appears to have done a bit of
a curve that follows the layout of the monitors.
see how the figurines wrap around in front of the dual monitor setup. And zooming in here,
what do we actually have here? Can you identify any of the figurines?
So we've got several amiibo, Nintendo amiibo there underneath the screen. And I'm looking
and it looks to be Bowser. And I think that's Mega Man under there as well. And the guy from
Wow. Oh, I'm dying. Uh, Breath of the Wild. Then there's a bunch of funcos on the other side of
the iPad that he snuck in there because he's obviously forced to use this HP,
which everyone knows stands for high productivity.
Is that like a disc album thing next to it for all of the
DVDs that one would put into one's iPad? What is that?
No, I do believe that is a Nintendo switch inside a carrying case.
Oh, he's gaming at work.
Yes.
I love it.
It's just out there for the world to see not hiding anything.
Perfect.
You must love that Andrew.
It's like a Nintendo briefcase.
Yeah, you could open that just beautifully.
Wouldn't you see the screen probably has a little kick probably has a
kickstand on it.
So you can play, play your Nintendo games, just drinking that cup of coffee.
Now I'm zooming in.
Yeah.
In fact, funny, you bring up the cup of coffee.
I'm zooming in on this now.
Now I'm comparing that to the height of what appears to be an 11 inch iPad pro.
Is this a jumbo American coffee, Jason?
How big is this?
What's going on?
It is not.
No, no.
So that's a Dutch brothers coffee.
First of all.
So like another thousand points for that.
He gets, he gets so many points.
He's got the backpack points combined with the coffee points.
It it's off the charts.
I have to say in terms of points, I think he's up to like 35,000 points now.
Um, that's yeah.
So I think it's just a weird perspective here that coffee looks
gigantic, but it really isn't.
I think if I had to guess I would say that is no more than 14 ounces I would assume.
I have absolutely zero idea how much that is.
That's true.
How many milliliters is an ounce?
Oh my gosh.
I don't understand.
So we've got this HP laptop.
Okay.
Then we've got the iPad pro, which I'm assuming is not work provided.
Then I believe there's a Microsoft surface just in a box up on the shelf.
I don't, I'm curious what's going on there.
Cause it's clearly not iPad packaging mostly because the box is eight inches thick, but
yeah.
Why, why is that there?
And why use the HP?
It's funny you say that because the first thing I thought when I saw that was an accessory
for the iPad but it doesn't appear you're right it looks more like the kickstand rather than a stand
for the iPad. And it's got the white box that once you know kind of looks like an apple box
so i'm pretty sure it's a Surface but not entirely sure.
And is that an x-wing that's colored black and orange on that shelf? Because i don't recall
that from any of the movies do you think that's uh like a conscious color decision that he has
made from scratch or is that a model that one would buy? I think and I really
don't want to be judged on Star Wars knowledge but I believe that was from
one of the recent trilogy. I don't I'm not I don't think it's canon I'm saying
it's not canon sorry. It's not Kenyan that's for sure.
Ah, damn it! I wanted to do that!
[Music]
And then finally I see that he is browsing micro.blog on his HP
and I was just happy that it wasn't blocked by IT.
I think that's an Easter egg he's thrown us there.
I think so too.
The taskbar is worrying me but he saved it with micro.blog.
I think it's nice.
Martin, do you have any other points on Gabriel's desk?
Look, I'm impressed again.
I think we have another example of an ultra-wide composition, which, like Craig's, has been
taken indoors with what I assume is a fluorescent light above his head.
So the fact that I was able to zoom in without the super ML of Pixelmator Pro and make out
different details, well done, Gabriel, on such fine composition.
I feel very ignorant not knowing who half of these figurines are, but yeah, look, post-it
notes, I'm not a big fan personally.
I've never understood them.
I don't like writing on them.
I think they're very uncomfortable.
I don't know where to put them.
I see people putting them on their computers and then I wonder if they are aware of word
processes and text editing applications.
So Gabriel, I'm a little bit concerned.
Just open up your computer, whether it's the Windows HP laptop or the iPad, explore the
note-taking apps and see what you can do with that post-it note.
Maybe I'm being rough, but I just want to make sure that you're aware of those note
features.
Anything else for this particular desk situation?
Yeah, I've got a couple of questions.
Again we've got the angles, the seating angles.
How are people living this way?
We had Craig sitting at a weird angle.
We got Gabs.
not only sort of at a weird angle but his face is like smushed against the
screen. He would breathe and fog up the glass on that monitor. He's so close.
But you extend your arms fully to reach your computer don't you Andrew as we
discovered so of course this looks strange to you. I do like to recline but yeah a
little bit worried about that and I'll just put where I used to work we had
similar sort of you know you have an L-shaped desk they provided us with
these sort of metal things that would slide on to the desk. So they have a metal almost
like a square right and you would slide it on over the desk and then put it to the corner
where the two things make and almost form like another plane so a triangular plane.
Does that make any sense? I'm describing that really poorly but basically you could convert
That L shape to a credit.
It sounds like it sounds like you're building a desk from scratch if I'll be honest.
I think I think what you're thinking of is a workplace where they make you build furniture.
Basically it made that corner usable because you could like come up into it as like another.
Right angle describing that classic joke about the job interview at Ikea where you walk in and there's a flat pack on the floor is that where you work.
So it's like 14 ounces is is more like 40 milliliters is really what we're talking about here you put the ounces into the corner of the desk turns it into milliliters and then you've got usable space.
All that's been all week trying to figure out how to explain this thing and I still can't do it
It's hopeless
but anyway this thing you could create another angle and basically have your
Monitor at tucked into that corner and use it efficiently. Okay, that sounds good space
What else did I have oh, yes, is it basically sort of the iPad thing? It must be really frustrating. No, you've got more power and
Style in that iPad screen than both of those big monitors
Just just probably more pixels wouldn't it and then it looks like he's got a lot of his toys in that cabinet that appears to.
Stop your stowaway cabinet and I'm just wondering if when night comes to see close it lock it and take the key home.
Keep those toys who cares about the Microsoft surface I mean nobody want that but the toys.
Nobody's toys and what's in that little chest of drawers under the table I mean I wonder if Gabriel's one of those guys who likes to print everything do you reckon there are stacks of paper in there.
Who knows could be a good could be a very good printing guy you know print all double sided maybe not just do single sided use up the whole name just go for it you know.
Live dangerously, live indulgently.
It's not your ink, it's not your paper.
Four pages of just copyright notices at the bottom, email footers.
And you just know that at work there's going to be some sort of, you know,
black ink only policy, but due to the nature of the layers of Windows preferences,
he forgot to click grayscale in the correct properties pane,
and all the colors being used, and Gabriel's the most unpopular guy in the office.
So he's probably hiding all of his color printing in those drawers.
I'm just now realizing that it appears to be dark outside as well. So are they keeping you there
very late at night or is it very early in the morning? In which case I say, I'm sorry.
Or did they paint the windows black? Who knows?
Oh, maybe.
He works in a casino.
Keep them guessing. If they don't know it's daylight, they don't want to leave.
Thank you, Gabriel, for your submission.
Yeah, I'm sure he'll be submitting more stuff for us to look at in the future.
Maybe a nice home desk photo.
