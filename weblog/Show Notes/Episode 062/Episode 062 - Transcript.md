Hello and welcome hemispherians. This is Martin speaking and Martin alone just for the moment at least don't worry
This has happened before I'm just here to make a quick announcement
Then Andrew and Jason will be back on the show
I haven't eliminated them from the entire podcast, but just to be honest with you if they ever do disappoint me, they're finished gone
That's it
Anyway onto the announcement if you did happen to miss it in our hemispheric blog or on our hemispheric discord in the games channel
we did announce the Arcadia June 2022 results.
I wanna congratulate in first place
for the second year in a row, Eric M. Walk,
as he's known on Discord, with a score of 60,
followed by Furstenberg with 37 in second place,
and Tashkan with 28.
Of course, these are the top three positions
and they're impressive, but I wanna thank all of you
for your unbelievable enthusiasm, your dedication,
and just the fun that you had with this competition.
It means a lot to the three of us
to see so many people taking part in what we put out there on the podcast.
It's just really gratifying.
So thank you to all of you for your efforts.
And even if you didn't take part, consider it next year.
Anyway, time to go on to the show and let Andrew and Jason back into the studio.
Thanks for your kind attention.
[Music]
All right, Andrew, kick us off. I'm a little confused because my Zoom window's got four boxes in it.
It's usually got three. What's going on here?
Yeah, well, I'm working forward to getting the whole Brady Bunch effect.
I want to have nine people ultimately.
Sure.
- Sure.
- Ideally Alice in the middle, something like that.
But for today we're at four.
We have a special guest.
I decided there weren't enough Australians on our show
and we needed another one.
So the Southern Hemisphere is strongly represented today
because we have a special guest now, Anthony.
And now this is the nervous bit
'cause I haven't even checked with you.
Aegis?
- Correct, spot on, spot on.
First, that's quite unusual.
Most people mispronounce the name.
So big tick for that.
- Thank you, thank you.
How often do you get Argyus?
That's, uh, Adjuis is common, apparently.
Adjuis, right.
Okay.
Adjuis.
So, yes.
But yeah, it's, it's, it's in, in, in, in, um, it's a Maltese surname.
If you go to Malta, it's like Smith or, you know, it's a quite a common surname there.
But in Australia, it's like a 0.001% of people have it.
So, I'm not surprised people mispronounce it.
Martin is a European representative as well.
So he, no doubt he would have nailed it as well.
But Anthony, you're joining us here today because you're kind of,
kind of a big deal in the Australian tech scene.
And we only get the people who are big deals on this show. So you run a,
I don't want to talk too much for you,
but you have a newsletter that goes out called the sizzle and that goes out.
And that's basically,
it's like a summary of all the tech news that you want to know,
but written in a really enjoyable kind of Australian way.
I would probably say like you put you have a few words that were not allowed to use on this podcast thrown in there for good measure but I think that's that's a bit of flavor and Australian is into it but it also does a really good job of summarizing all the stuff that's gone on in the last 24 hours of the tech world.
Without you having like the reader having to do any other hard work because we throw a few bucks your way and you do all that work for us.
So that's sort of how I know you, but I also know you have a long background in technology
and that kind of stuff. So I thought it'd just be a great opportunity to have you on today
to talk about what you do, tell us a little bit about yourself, and get to know you a bit better,
and our listeners get to know you. And so yeah, I thought that's where we're at, just a short chat.
And so I guess first thing, I want to ask the first question of you, and can you just tell us
what is the sizzle from your point of view? I've given my readers idea of it, but tell us how it
came about and how you see it. - It's exactly what you said it is. It's like the whole point of the
sizzle is to save people time reading tech news. Because I mean, I'm middle-aged now, 37, and I
started the sizzle seven years ago. And I noticed more and more of my friends, I talked to them
about the tech stuff and they wouldn't have known about these things because it's like, "Well, I'm
I'm busy with my family, I'm busy with work, I'm busy with life.
Yeah, I'm still the only sad one left still reading this kind of tech news.
I figured people at work are kind of missing out on these conversations that someone might
mention something and it's like, "Oh crap, what?
I didn't know about that.
How did I not know?"
It's kind of a bit embarrassing not to know things in that industry where you're supposed
to be working on and you're supposed to know.
And I know working with - when I used to have a full-time job working in an office, it was
a bit - there was someone who was like - they obviously know their stuff but they're just
so busy with work, they know the latest news in the last few months, for example, and then
they'll look silly in a meeting.
I think the sizzle kind of helps a lot with that.
It doesn't make you an expert on that topic but at least if something's brought up, you're
aware of it and if it does interest you or you need to know, at least you can go, "Oh
I should know about this thing happening.
And then you can go read more about it.
So you're not missing out.
It's kind of like a summary notes of Australian,
mostly Australian, but also mostly global
'cause it's a global thing, tech news.
- Wow, that's cool.
So in terms of the tech news itself,
is it mainly focused on hardware, software,
or is it literally just all technology
in general in that area?
- I try to get-- - Is it kind of spread across?
- Yeah, it's hard 'cause it's a summary.
So you don't wanna put everything in there.
Otherwise, it's no longer a summary.
So I try and focus it on the big five tech companies
are kind of the main thing that I write about a lot,
like Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft,
and the fifth one, Amazon sometimes.
Amazon's a bit tough 'cause they're a tech company,
but they also sell stuff.
So I kind of not talk about them a lot of the time.
In Australia, there's a lot of like telco news.
So like what the DMV ends up to,
what Telstra does, that kind of stuff.
And also government IT news,
Because the way that their policy, they make laws, they make policy impacts the wider industry
and doesn't get much coverage in Australia because there's lots of other news that's
got a more importance to most people like law and order, immigration news, the economy
in general.
But technology news has a big impact on how people in the IT industry, how in Australia
at least, how they do their job, the laws they have to follow, the products that we
user changed by those laws and doesn't get much coverage.
So I kind of make a bit of an effort to focus on that.
And there's also a little section in there where I just kind of put in what I'm interested
in because I like computer hardware.
I like the kind of very retro tech stuff or just whatever takes my fancy, whatever I think
is cool, I just chuck in there at the end as like a dog on a skateboard kind of story
just to make things a bit more interesting as opposed to just like boring tech news,
which can get boring sometimes, like, "Oh, Elon Musk did this, okay, whatever."
You know, "Facebook is being bastards again, okay, that happens at least once a week."
Yeah, that's the daily news.
Yeah, but it's that kind of stuff happens, and I like to put something interesting for
the nerds in there as well at the bottom.
You mentioned that you put things in the newsletter that maybe don't get as much coverage as other
big tech stories.
Yeah.
Was that your primary motivation for starting this newsletter, or was it something else?
Not necessarily.
The motivation was helping people keep up to date, helping my friends essentially not
be out of the loop.
But then I realized no one else is-- if you wouldn't read the sources, you might not even
know about particularly the Australian things.
Because a lot of Australians get their tech news from American sites, and they're not
going to cover the NBN.
They're not going to cover the latest online safety bill or the mandatory data retention
stuff. I think that's important for Australians to know what our government
is doing and without it, you kind of have to go digging for it almost.
Unless the ABC decides to make a topic for a night on the
730 report, you just wouldn't hear about it. Yeah, that's a good point. I mean, I think
tech is predominantly dominated by the US for sure. I mean, well, and I mean,
list the companies you just all named, all five, they're all here
For the most part so I can see that being a big problem across many countries of just trying to get their view on what all what's going on and all this stuff.
We've been working hard to educate Jason on the the disaster that has been the NBN.
Many many years in Australia and Martin actually Martin recently had had some.
NBN problems but he's upgraded himself to GongNet being based in Wollongong just he's just created his own network called we're calling GongNet and since then his coverage has been flawless.
I don't make others jealous I won't dwell on it too much but yeah blazing speeds to the node here in Wollongong it's great.
We compare speed tests quite often and I won't mention any numbers but I'm still ahead.
I mean, the NBN has been like a perennial topic for me.
Like I've been writing the sales now for seven years and I was reading some of the
very first, the first like 10 issues and it's like, "Oh, the NBN was mentioned then and
I'm still writing about it now."
It's just such a, it was such a massive project.
People forget.
It was like $70 billion.
It's Australia's largest ever thing we've ever spent money on and it gets so little
like scrutiny and coverage from mainstream media and I think, and some people are actually
happy with it.
"Oh, this is great. My internet's like 50 megabit."
That's not worth $70 billion.
That's like last generation tech
that we spend all this money on.
But other countries are like, "Oh, gigabit is like normal."
Like a good example is New Zealand.
They spent a fraction of the price, gave everybody a fiber.
And now you can get 10 gig internet there,
like in your house for like a few hundred bucks a month.
Whereas that same spend in Australia
gets you one gigabit with a measly upload.
yet the government spent way more money.
I think it's because it's such a boring topic
for most people, they don't really care.
It's like when I turn it on, it works, I can watch stuff,
but I think there's so much potential
that Australia's missing out on,
but not having everybody connected at those high speeds
in a reliable fashion at a cheap price,
which is the big deal, it's so expensive as well.
Like if you want a 50 megabit connection in Australia,
it's 70 bucks a month.
Whereas you can go to New Zealand
and get a gigabit for almost like the same price,
or you can get 100 megabit for like 40 bucks a month.
So if you're a person who just wants internet access,
that's reliable, decent speed,
you're paying twice as much as what you used to on ADSL.
How do we get to the situation
we spent $70 billion to pay twice as much
for a little bit faster speed?
It's such a bad situation.
- You've been covering this for a while, Anthony,
and I know there's that whole kind of controversy
we've had for years.
you've been covering it of policy being handed between people. Is that also an issue, do
you think, with Australia technologically, that we have a relatively small population
spanned across this gigantic continent, whereas New Zealand's kind of in this narrow lane?
Do you think Australia has issues because of its physical size?
It's a small issue. I mean, most of the population, half of Australia lives in Melbourne and Sydney.
So that's, we're actually a very dense country in terms of where people live. The issue comes
comes from the NBN was supposed to help regional Australia and urban Australia.
And that was just a bad approach.
What urban Australia needs is very different than what regional Australia needs.
And the cost of servicing regional Australia is just so high, giving them the same as what
urban Australia has just makes no sense.
You could have given every city in Australia gigabit internet for cheaper than what they
did in New Zealand, and then given regional Australia, say, fixed wireless or give them
a different technology that's more suitable for what it costs to service those very sparse
areas.
But even then, a lot of the non-capital cities in the States, like in Victoria, like in Ballarat
or Bendigo, they actually have fiber internet.
There's a nice, small contained area.
It's a suburb.
It's no different than Melbourne suburbs or Sydney suburbs.
So you could have given 80% of Australia high-speed internet for very little cost, and that 20%,
they could have gotten better than what they had,
but maybe not getting the exact same
as the metropolitan areas.
It would have been a better thing
for the entire country overall
at a fraction of the cost.
- I just realized we didn't even discuss,
Anthony, where in Australia are you?
'Cause we obviously know where Andrew and Martin are,
but where are you located?
- I live outside of Melbourne in a place called Bekkes Marsh,
which is Canonia, Ballarat.
- Okay.
- So it's like a gold, it used to be a gold mining town,
back in the 1800s.
And now it's like a community town,
halfway between Melbourne, halfway between Ballarat,
halfway between Geelong.
So it's like a nice little kind of triangle
of Victoria's main cities,
and I live in the middle of it.
- Gotcha, okay.
Yeah, it was 'cause I'm trying to,
I'm placing where everybody's at on a map now
and realizing we don't know where you're at.
So now we do, so thank you.
- Right down the bottom.
- And I feel like I'm walking into a trap at this point,
but I have to bring it up on behalf of Jason.
As a Victorian, who do you like less,
Western Australia or New South Wales?
Probably New South Wales.
I knew it.
I knew it.
West Australia gives us all that sweet, you know, minerals and gas.
Whereas New South Wales, what are they giving us?
That's right.
Celebrities.
We've got a lovely temperance zone with agriculture.
Andrew is very gassy, that's true.
Yeah.
I'm all about the high viz.
Yep.
All right, shot myself in the foot there.
I knew that was going to happen.
Go on, Jason.
The other thing, we just kind of blew past everything
that has to do with Anthony.
So we're talking about tech obviously,
but what is your tech view personally?
Are you Windows, are you Mac, are you Android,
are you iOS?
What is your day-to-day tech life in general
and what kinds of tools are you using
to do things like this newsletter?
The newsletter itself, I use,
recently I got into it,
a tool called IntegraMAT, which is like a Zapier,
like a no-code tool.
And it's been a game changer for me at all,
'cause for the last kind of seven years,
I was doing it all kind of by, a bit by hand,
or using someone else's platform.
But IntegraMAT, I can kind of link
all these little services together,
and it's all kind of automated,
and it's made my life so much easier.
So that's like a tool that I really like using right now.
But day to day, I use a Mac, got an M1 Mac mini.
You see behind me, I've got a Windows PC, like it's a Lenovo ThinkStation.
I've got Linux servers at home.
My phone, I use an iPhone 13, but I've got an Android phone as well here as a spare phone.
So I kind of use everything.
I'm not really aligned to one brand, but day to day I use Apple stuff just because they're
nice.
And the M1 chip in the Mac mini is just such a good value computer, which is weird to say
for an Apple device. It's been a long time since you could say they're a good value device. But
the Mac Mini for a thousand bucks, this thing is silent, uses no power, it's fast, and it works
pretty well. So yeah. It's frigging wild what has happened with Apple Silicon in the last year and
a half. It's just, it's a whole new, we finally hit a new generation to move forward because
everything for so long was just speed bump, speed bump, speed bump, meh, who cares. But now it's
It's like, holy shit, look what we're able to do with these computers now.
And yeah, for the price, right?
The price didn't double, but performance did.
So it's been wild.
Do you find you're using a lot of different stuff out of just curiosity?
Or does that help you with the newsletter in terms of being able to,
you're maybe not a day-to-day user of all these things, but you have maybe a little more familiarity?
Or is it more just, I kind of want to know what's out there so I have a little bit of everything?
It's both.
I mean, I'm curious, I like technology stuff.
I'm curious about how these things work.
And that also tends to help the newsletter too.
'Cause if I just write about Apple stuff,
it limits who would read it.
And I wanna know, particularly for Apple people
who subscribe to the newsletter,
they often learn about other platforms.
They're like, "Oh, I didn't know Windows could do that."
Or, "Oh, Android doesn't suck as hard
as I thought it sucked."
Like it is. (both laughing)
There's benefits of being a bit more open-minded.
And I understand why people don't,
it's like you just have a tool that you want to work
and you use it and it works fine.
Or you use it at work, like I'm an iOS developer,
I have to use iOS.
So you don't really have time to try out other stuff.
But I think it's healthy to be open-minded
about alternatives that are out there.
- I would agree with that.
- Look, in my attempt to be open-minded,
can I just ask a quick question?
Windows 11, does it still have a registry?
- It does, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, okay. - It's definitely still there.
It's the Windows.
Like to take the registry out of Windows
We're taking like a human.
It's just not gonna live.
(laughing)
- Okay, the old HK local machine lives on.
- Still there.
- Yep.
All right, good to know.
(laughing)
I'm obviously all in the Mac world these days.
- Yeah.
(laughing)
- And the other thing that sort of I'm curious about,
and I've seen you mentioned from time to time,
I don't know whether it's on Twitter
or in the newsletter or somewhere,
that you seem to be constantly uploading stuff
to the internet archive.
Could you just tell us a little bit about what that project is all about?
Yeah, I mean, the Internet Archive, I recently... I've been using it for years. Like, we've
all used it, the Wayback Machine. So if you look at the website, it's in the past, that's
run by the Internet Archive. But they also have books and magazines, and CD-ROMs, floppy
discs, music, movies, TV shows, all this kind of anything, any media at all that you can
think of, they collect and preserve and then make available for everyone to see.
They've got petabytes and petabytes of data and servers that they host for free.
It's a shame that there's all these, particularly for me, the computer magazines, the Australian
ones that I would read as a kid, you can't find them now.
I've been trying to find them and I scan them in and I upload them to the internet archive
and anyone in the world can find it.
And they actually have a nice viewing system.
So if you upload a bunch of TIFF files, it'll actually generate a PDF and it'll generate
a web view for you.
And there's apps that actually scrape, for want of a better word, because you're not
really scraping it.
You're allowed to use this stuff and make it the app on an iPad to view old magazines.
They call it a magazine rack.
You can just flick through thousands and thousands of old magazines and just read them for free.
It's literally like the library of your dreams.
There's so much stuff that you can never have to read at all.
And it's just a great free service.
I thought it would be rude not to contribute to this service while it still is here because
one day it could all be gone.
Who knows?
But for now, yeah, I'm uploading to it because I would be ashamed for that not to be available
anymore.
That's freaking awesome. I love that. That is so cool. I will, A, I'm gonna go find those and look at them because I love old computer magazines.
Archive.org is the website. Any topic that you think of, it's probably there.
Yeah, I've actually started uploading this show to Archive.org as well, just as yet another place to put content so that it can live in the ether of what is known as the internet that we know of today anyway, before we get to Web 3.
- Sure. - Anyway.
- This is actually very dangerous.
I don't know if you know Anthony,
but Jason is our show notes master,
and he's probably gonna be tempted
to link the entire archive within this episode's show notes.
- Absolutely, yeah, yeah, for sure.
- It'll just be a duplicated archive.
- We touched on something about a few,
well, many episodes ago around the idea
of archiving of old games in the sense
that we're running into this issue now
where things are starting to hit a point
where once the console goes away,
you have no possible way of ever playing those games again,
especially with all the like shitty DRM and stuff like that.
So this has been definitely a topic top of my mind in terms of what are we going
to do with all this content that is going to just die and be completely
inaccessible if we don't find a way. And yes, maybe it's paid.
I don't, I kind of don't, I'll say I don't care at this point.
I will care in the future, I'm sure,
but some way to just archive all this stuff so that it's at least accessible.
And there are tools available and kept up to date to access this information,
because at least with something like a magazine, it is effectively, you know,
it can be a JPEG or a TIFF or whatever at the end of the day.
And that will more than likely be viewable far, far into the future.
The day we can't view a JPEG, like some shit probably went really bad.
But like for a game where it's these weird binaries that are in all these DRM
formats and awkward, awkward file formats that are very proprietary, that is
super scary. And I don't know how we're going to get out of that because
right now all of that is built out of a need to keep things all within a
company and not accessible outside. So the idea of something like
archive.org is super important, but if we can't access it, we're kind of
screwed. So I think what you're doing is fantastic and I would love to see this extend out further
and further. If a game is 50 years old, put it on there. You're not making money anyway. Let's just
get it out there. - The thing is, the Internet Archive does have a copyright claim system.
So some of the magazines that I have put up on there, they've been taken down because the
The publisher will somehow finds it and goes,
"Well, this is our copyright, it's removed."
And these are like 20--
- And it's talking about like Pentium processors
from 15 years ago.
- Or like a 20 year old Sony magazine
about the PlayStation.
It's like, you're not making money off this.
You're actually doing yourself a disservice by removing it.
And it's like, and I had,
the Internet Archive has a three strikes in your app policy.
And because I upload thousands and thousands of documents,
I hit that three strikes and my account got closed down.
So I was-- - Oh, geez.
- And for a few days,
or every night, like 2,500 items were just gone
and just taken down.
And that freaked me out a bit.
And I was lucky that Jason Scott on Twitter,
who's one of the,
I think he's like a community ambassador
for the Internet Archive.
I reached out to him and he said,
look, we'll put it back up,
but the copyright content is gone.
that's just gone for good.
So I was able to redownload everything that I uploaded
and I put it onto tapes, like actual, like LTO5 tapes.
So now I've got a copy of my own
as well as on the internet archive,
because who knows, maybe in someday
the owner of that copyright will come back
and go on some 70s PC magazine and go,
"That is ours, you cannot have it anymore."
And that's another issue.
So there's the copyright seems to be the main problem
with archiving all this stuff.
Like 10 years, 20 years,
I can understand copyright for that long,
but 50, 70, 90 years of copyright,
it's doing more harm than is good
for the whole ecosystem of media.
- When you think about it,
it's a combination of history and marketing.
So on the one hand, in terms of history,
if you give people access to that,
it's an educational opportunity.
You're actually broadening knowledge.
And then the marketing thing, it kind of reminds me,
maybe this isn't a good example,
but I don't know if you guys ever remember
walking into a shop.
this is a few years ago now,
and you take a picture of something,
maybe to send, oh, here's that thing you wanted or whatever.
And I would have people come up to me and say,
you can't take pictures in the shop.
But this is word of mouth marketing
to discover the thing that, okay, I'll leave then.
So people discovering old stuff,
it might be particularly niche,
but when you upload this, someone discovers it and goes,
oh, I wonder what they're doing today.
Or it leads them down a rabbit hole
and they discover and buy stuff.
So it seems odd to me.
- Yeah, yeah.
- The music industry found the same thing
with piracy.
When people had free access to all these MP3s
and sharing music, the sales of records went up.
They never lost money.
The concert sales went crazy
'cause people wanted to see these bands live
or see these artists live, or they buy merchandise.
So yeah, copyright can get in the way a lot of times
and it's possibly more harm than good.
There's lots of people who are smarter than me
who have talked about this,
but I think from piracy,
if my example of pirating media,
I buy more media because I have access to refine my tastes,
to know what I like, and then spend money
on what I know I like because I'm not wasting it on junk.
That like, you know, like, oh, why don't I spend money
on that?
But if I'm able to pirate it, you can get more experience
on what you actually like and don't like,
and then spend the big bucks when you get older.
Like now, when I'm, I actually have a job now,
I can buy this stuff.
Whereas when I was a kid, I had no option but to pirate it
and it's paid off for the media companies.
I'm sure I spent a lot more now
than if I hadn't had built that taste as a teenager
and as a young adult when I had no money.
- I always find the weirdest one.
I watch a ton of old crap from like the 40s and 50s
and they'll always strip out the commercials
due to copyright.
And I'm like, it's a commercial from 1954.
I wanna see it 'cause it's probably really dumb
'cause it's a commercial from the 50s,
but yet they take it out because it's like,
Oh, we don't want to advertise our brand for free.
It's like, well--
You can't even buy like heart and liver tonic anymore,
and smoking's no longer healthy.
So what's the big deal?
Yeah, like, come on, let me see the cool cigarette ad.
All right, jeez.
Anyway, so well, I'm happy to hear that you're
putting stuff on archive.org.
I definitely want to check out the old computer magazines,
especially from Australia, because I've obviously
never seen those here in the United States.
But I have fond memories of computer magazines
from years and years ago.
What's the best old Australian computer magazine?
- My favorite is Australian Personal Computer,
APC, it's short-handed too.
- I used to subscribe to that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Lots of people did.
It was the biggest one in the country
and they've been going since the early 80s
and I think they still exist.
They still pump out issues on the trees.
So that's got some big stamp houses.
And there's also another magazine,
they're not around anymore,
but one called Your Computer,
and they were around a bit before
Australian Personal Computer,
and they go back to like the late '70s,
and so there's someone who has the very, very first computers
and they're all like handmade kits essentially,
and they're all Australian ones.
So you get a lot of people,
things in there that were like,
what the hell is this?
I've never heard of this stuff before,
'cause it's very specific Australian devices that,
yeah, that have been lost through the histories of time.
But now, 'cause the magazines are up there,
you can actually see these.
And a lot of people who are in that magazine,
they're actually still around, they're alive.
And you can actually talk to them on Twitter.
I've seen a few of them.
I posted up a funny article that someone wrote.
One of them I read was someone was complaining
about the mouse, how the mouse is not a user-friendly device
and that it's going to hurt computer knowledge.
Kind of like how now everyone says,
Touch screens, you can't really do anything productive with a touch screen.
Back in the 80s, it was like, oh, with the mouse, you can't do anything productive with a mouse.
And the guy on Twitter, he found me and said he had no idea that he wrote that 40 years ago.
And it was great to read it again.
And obviously, he was wrong.
So, yeah, look for your computer, an Australian personal computer.
And that's kind of my favorite Australian one.
That's awesome.
Excellent. I can read it back up on my favourite Dick Smith VZ200, Martin.
Yeah. I learned about a thing Dick Smith was selling called the Vytel device. It's like
a whole internet before the internet was in Australia. In the '80s, you would get this
kind of box that you put your phone onto and it would talk to Telstra servers. You could do
your Commonwealth banking, your Qantas book flights. You could buy shares on the ASX
through a Commodore 64. And it's like, this is great. Like,
this is actually easier to use than is now. If you want to use
internet banking and the website and buy shares, they're actually
a bit of a pandy ass to do. Whereas this computer device,
you just like literally just Qantas, buy a ticket, and it
will work. So it's yeah, they're fascinating articles. Yeah,
Vietel was like Australia's kind of compu serve, I guess.
AOL back in the 80s on a Commodore 64
and the Dick Smith computers, whatever they were called,
they had access to Vietel.
- That's incredible.
- I love the idea of sending like banking credentials
and credit card numbers just through plain text.
- Oh yeah, there was no encryption.
- Just credit cards flying around left and right.
Somebody's just like on the other end,
just writing them all down.
Yeah, it probably is actually, yeah.
You had to fact your two factor authentication codes.
Apple pay, not quite, but we're getting there.
I wonder how many Dolomites kids were on that system back in the day, if that was possible.
Yeah.
Hey, Anthony, another thing, a lot of our listeners to this show are kind of, you know, hobbyist bloggers as well.
We have a lot of writers and things that listen, as well as ourselves.
We pump out a Hemispheric Views newsletter each month and that kind of thing.
We write our own blogs.
One of the things I've noticed is you have a blog, but you use the Discourse forum software to blog,
which seems like a bit of an odd use case.
But I'm-
Wait, what? Hold on.
Wait a second.
Yeah, I use-
You use Discourse for your blogging platform.
And it's fantastic.
Like it's, I really enjoy it because first of all, it's Discourse, it's a forum software.
It's designed for communities to chat and engage and stuff.
But it's really easy to install.
It's just one bucket image.
I've installed a dozen of these discourse setups from different groups and communities
and they're rock solid.
I haven't done any maintenance on them.
I just run the update whenever there's an update and it works.
You can run it on a cheap VPS for like five bucks a month
and you can link your images on a S3 type storage.
So Amazon S3.
I use a Backblaze B2
And then you can serve the images up through a CDN.
So you can pay overall for bandwidth.
It's, I pay cents a month for my forums.
And you don't have to worry about scale.
There's infinite storage, there's infinite bandwidth.
And the actual text side of things is on the VPS,
which is not much at all.
So it's really easy to set up, really easy to maintain.
And the layout, I use the forums as categories.
So if I write about electric cars,
I've got an electric car forum on my blog
where it's a forum, but only I may post.
And if I want to update something that I've written,
I actually add a post to the item.
So let's say I wrote an article three years ago
and then a year later, it's like,
all right, these numbers changed,
or I did this, or I learned this, I'll add a post to it.
So it's like a little forum thread
that only I've posted in to update what I've done.
I've got another thread on this forum
that's things I learned about Linux.
So as I find something that I want to remember,
like how to access an NTFS drive on a Linux machine,
I'll post a comment in that thread on how to do it
with pictures and links and stuff.
So I remember it.
So for me, it's also a blog and a wiki
and just for my own self.
And yeah, it works really well.
And it looks nice too.
I don't have to worry about theming it.
The default theme looks fine.
So it's, yeah, it is weird.
It's not a normal blog, but it works for me.
There's RSS feeds, there's tags, there's comments.
It's backed up really easily because it's all built in.
There's a whole backup system.
And yeah, it cost me six or five dollars a month to run and it's all owned on my own
machine.
I don't have to worry about what WordPress does or what Squarespace does to their platform.
And it's, yeah, works quite well.
Wow.
My next question is if it's fully RSS capable, it sounds like you just would subscribe to one of those categories and you would just get all those updates every day.
That's cool.
Or to the whole forum itself too if you want.
So if you didn't care about my electric car, and so I just want my Linux stuff, just subscribe to that forum and you'll get it.
I was just thinking, just like your archive.org suggestion, which is going to cause show notes
trouble for Jason, we have a few dedicated listeners who are very enthusiastic about
shifting the data of their blogs and all of their themes and everything constantly.
So you might have just made a considerable chunk of our audience explore discourse and
discuss it on our Discord.
So thank you.
I sure as hell never would have thought discourse for a blog.
But I mean, it sounds like it does everything a blog does.
I guess the term blog in general has sort of become a weird thing.
It is now.
I mean, like, is Twitter a blog?
Technically kind of is.
You post updates.
And you can actually write more than you could when it was first invented as a micro-blocking
format.
And I think that they're even adding the ability for some test users now to have long-form
posts.
So instead of people having--
Other notes.
Yeah.
And I think you'll probably be able to subscribe to those if you want to read them.
So yeah, it's--
And then the newsletter stuff and all the other--
Correct.
Yeah, interesting.
So it's never been easier to upload your words to the internet.
The hard part is still how do people find out about reading it?
That's I think what everyone struggles with.
Yeah.
What's your approach to, okay, you've got this newsletter, which is a paid newsletter,
five bucks a month, 50 bucks a year.
You've got your discourse blog, which is free, openly available on the internet, I assume.
Yes, it is.
How do you tackle, I've got this thing I want to write about.
Do I put it in the newsletter?
Do I put it in the newsletter then later on the blog?
Or does it just go to the blog?
Like what is your,
without giving away too much secret sauce of the sizzle,
like what does your funnel look like
for how you decide where something ends up?
Or is it just, I don't give too much of a care about this.
So it's just gonna be like a quick tweet or whatever.
Like what's your--
- No, no, no, he writes the opposite on each one
to see who's actually paying attention.
(laughing)
- Well, I mean, there is like, there's Twitter,
which is kind of like the, I don't know,
primordial ooze of content.
Like that's just like, whatever, who cares?
I can write whatever I want there.
And then if it seems like it's too long for Twitter,
I'll post it on my blog.
Whereas the sizzle is more,
it's a very structured format.
There's three news stories,
one kind of random interesting story
and a bunch of bargains,
like cheap stuff I found on internet.
So that's not really a place to be like a creative,
long form posting writing, that's just,
it's a very formulated approach.
There's three news stories,
one interesting news thing, and the bargains.
And that goes out every day.
So if I wanna write, actually write something,
it goes on my blog.
Or if I just wanna vent or talk about,
mention something, I'll put it on Twitter.
And it's pretty straightforward.
- Your newsletter is every day?
- Every day, every day.
I try to get it out and done by about four or 5 p.m.
Melbourne time.
- Holy crap.
- Every weekday, isn't it?
You take the weekends off.
Yes.
For real.
OK.
Thank goodness.
Oh my gosh.
I was like--
And I also take off the public holidays in Victoria.
OK.
And I often--
How dare you?
Yeah, I know.
That's tough.
And I often take off a few weeks.
I pay someone else to ride it for me when I'm not--
when I want to take a break.
But 95% of the time, it's me riding it.
And it goes out every weekday.
Yeah.
Wow.
Do you sort of have like a hopper that you get ready through the week or is it every day?
It's like, it's three o'clock.
It's time to get something out.
Let's go.
- Well, it's more throughout the day, I'll read my RSS feeds.
So I've got thousands of RSS feed items and I just kind of trawl through them to find the interesting stuff.
- What RSS reader/service do you use?
Because everyone's going to want to know.
- Feedbin and reader.
So Phoebe in the background and for non-Mac devices
and Apple devices and Radar for any Apple device.
- Got it, yeah, okay.
- I trawl through it all and usually the most common items.
So whatever's most talked about and then in those feeds
will find a place in the newsletter.
So if there's like,
I've got about 150 tech specific news sources.
If every blog or every site mentions this news item,
I'll probably mention it in the newsletter
unless it's a very specific US thing like Verizon turned on 5G,
Australians, I don't really care.
- Don't care.
- Yeah.
Whereas the opposite, if an Australian thing happens that's not mentioned on
those US blogs, I'll mention it.
So, and then, but I do have a lot of pre-cooked content, stuff I prepared
earlier for the interesting non 24-hour news stuff.
I've got a, used to be quite big now to getting a bit shallow.
I need to rise some more.
But I just kind of paste it in if I'm busy on that day.
Like I say, I have an appointment in the afternoon.
I'll paste it in from stuff I've written in the past.
But I've got in my, I use for bookmarks, a pinboard.
I've got in there about 2,500 items.
So there's a lot of stuff that I've said,
it's like, I want to mention this at some point
in the newsletter.
And then when I'm bored or if I feel like it,
I'll write, I might write 10 or so stories
out of those 2,500 articles and store them
for later. They're kind of timeless things, not necessarily things that happened in the
last 24 hours. But yeah, most of my - it takes me about three or four hours to write an issue
of the newsletter. And most of it's reading, not writing. The writing takes me about half
an hour to one hour max, but the reading takes a long time. Often there's topics I have to
actually at least understand on some level. Like last week, the EU approved the Digital
market act and the digital services act, massive laws in the EU that are going to like, pretty
much ban a lot of US tech companies from doing business in the EU.
So I had to at least, I had to read that.
That took me like about an hour to be like, "What actually is this?
How do I explain this in like 150 words, this massive gigantic thing?"
And often I'll write the same thing two or three times and it's because it's like, "This
sucks."
Like I read over it and it's like, "I don't understand what ... " I read that back and
It's like, this is not helpful.
This is not explaining what I want to get across.
And I actually, or I'll just write too much.
'Cause like I wrote, it's too waffly, too many words.
I'll just trim in half and cut down.
And even though it's shorter, it's a lot more useful
for people who just kind of just, who read it.
I can get into that trap a lot when I write.
I just write way too much.
And it's like, this is not useful for people.
They don't want to read all this extra stuff.
I just want to know the core of it.
And if people are interested in learning more,
they'll read more somewhere else.
That's not the sizzle's job,
is not to be like an encyclopedia of information.
It's more to kind of tell you what happened
and then you can find out more on your own
through the links in the article, in what I wrote,
or just on Google, find out somewhere else, yeah.
- Got it.
So you're not trying to be the end all be all source
for this, you're just a jumping off point for,
hey, maybe you never heard about this.
So check out these 15 links on this topic.
Gotcha.
And maybe I missed it, or maybe it's super obvious, but sizzle, is that because it's
news that's hot off the press or is it because it's sausage sizzles?
It's more, there's a marketing saying, sell the sizzle, not the steak.
So the steak is like the actual useful stuff, like the meats of it, whereas I just have
the brief sizzle.
Like it's the brief interesting bits, you get that.
But if you want the meat, the steak, the big hunk of information, that's somewhere else.
You've got to find that elsewhere.
- And so, I think I'm just conscious of time.
So we're sort of coming to an end of the time we have.
There is an important question that listeners will want to know.
If you had to get rid of all your technology,
but be left with one single piece, one device,
what would that device be?
What would you choose to keep with you?
- Oh, the Mac mini for sure.
I could live without a phone.
I could live without all my other computers.
But if I just had the Mac mini and a monitor, I don't know if that counts as two.
If that counts as two, I'll just have a laptop.
No, you have to have a iMac.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
So, yeah, the power of the desktop computer is still amazing to me.
The iPad's nice.
I use it every day.
The phone's great.
You can use it as a GPS map out in the field.
The bulk of my work, the bulk of my research,
the bulk of computing happens on this desktop machine still,
and I'd be lost without it.
- I think you're our kind of guy.
I think we would probably all come up with the same answer.
- I have the same computer and I totally 100% agree,
and that's why you're allowed back on the show.
Thank you, Anthony.
- As Martin always says,
you can't get real work done on an iPad.
- No, you can't.
- Never have I said that.
(laughing)
- So Anthony-
- As they both edit the show on an iPad, so there you go.
That's impressive. I think I would struggle to get that done.
Ironically, that is one job that's easier on an iPad with Fairlight.
Far easier.
Fantastic app.
More enjoyable anyway.
Yeah.
My iPad's really good at Diablo Immortal.
I know that. But other than that, it's about it.
So.
Well Anthony, thank you so much for joining us on Hemisphere Reviews.
If people want to know more about where you are, like Jason will link everything in the show notes.
But where would they go if they want to learn about you or they want to give you money to buy a subscription to the sizzle?
What do they do? I go to the sizzle.com.au and you can also follow me on Twitter
I am @theecryption there. The E C R Y P T I O N
And that's where you find out anything you want to know all through there. Thank you so much Anthony. This has been really awesome
I'm super stoked actually on a couple of things the archive stuff is really exciting and I'm
Really excited to see what the sizzle can put in my inbox in terms of Australian perspective on tech because being in the US
Obviously us-centric
Everything is us all the time in terms of tech and it will be nice to have a different perspective
In my own world view. So thank you so much. Great to a trial
You can know credit card native just sign up and you'll enjoy it. You hear that folks
You can just use code absolutely nothing and get two week free trial. Exactly. Not everyone gets that
right? Just listeners or anyone else. Thanks. Anthony, thanks so much. That's awesome,
mate. Really appreciate it. You're very welcome. It's nice to chat to some other nerds. Thank you.
And we have a Patreon update. Now, Jason, you normally introduce these. Do you still want to
do this? I don't, no, because every time I do one, I say the name wrong and everyone's mad at me.
So no, I'm not going to do it.
I'm going to pass it off to you to actually give the update on
one prime plus dot com new member entering the arena.
That was your cue.
You could never be a wrestling announcer.
Geez.
Will you do it then?
I thought I thought he was creating suspense.
I thought it was like a silent thing.
Anyway, it is my sister and I'm going to say it in Jason's
voice. Jody F.
Jody F.
That's how you do it.
Thank you, Jodie, for joining the One Prime Plus hemispherian community.
I mean, it's one big community.
It's just a bit of extra One Prime Plus stuff, but we're very appreciative.
And there's a shout out on the show, as promised.
Do you think she's excited to be part of the long game now?
Do you think that's going to be like a resume booster or?
She's bursting with excitement, I can tell you.
OK, that's good.
I feel like good things are coming her way now due to this this new venture.
You may remember Jodie Feld from great episodes such as 044 sucked in.
Yeah.
She was actually a guest.
She's gone so far.
This is how powerful demonstrate views is like guesting is one thing, but then you get the one prime plus membership.
Totally different.
And sucked in is one of her favorite phrases.
It's like a stamp card at your local market, right?
It's like you go to, you go to your local place, you get the stamp card.
And once you get all those stamps filled up, you're a VIP and she's on her way.
Yeah.
So we appreciate. So we've got multiple members of the Feld family engaged in the show at this point.
It's so many feet.
Yeah, it's very full in here.
It's like a shoe store.
We could do that.
Yeah, that could be a brand extension.
Could be.
Hemispheric shoes.
Hemispheric shoes.
That's it.
It's a new brand.
You go into those metal slider things that you put the kids feet in.
It's great.
Yep.
I love those things.
A brannock device.
That's what they're called.
Oh, there you go.
Is it really?
I didn't know the term.
It's called a brannock device.
Yes.
Wow.
And it measures the length and the width of your feet.
Is that Branick or a Branick?
Like how an apron became apron when you said an apron.
No, it is a Branick device.
Got you. Branick.
OK, thank you for clarifying that.
You go. So anyway, Jodie, yeah, you have shoes, you have feet.
Welcome to the community.
It's wonderful. Jodie F.
It's in the game. It's in the game.
Long game.
I want to wish you a happy Eofi, Andrew.
Thank you.
I love you, Offee. Is it actually that time? Well, we missed it now.
Oh, we did. It's the first show after that. It's new financial year.
It's niffy now. But end of financial year is a wonderful time.
Bargains are plenty. Stationery.
That's what it's all about. Reams of paper. Reams of paper.
If you need staples, maybe a new computer, maybe a Wapom tablet.
If you need any of that kind of stuff, there's one place in Australia to go.
And that place is Officeworks.
Yeah.
Dot com dot au.
Not a sponsor.
Not a sponsor at all, but great for the EEOF deals.
You know what else it's, I have a theory about it's great for?
Hmm.
Please.
I can't even imagine.
I think it is a potentially great place to meet a significant other.
Interesting.
Really?
Yeah.
Do you have direct experience in this?
No.
Okay, but then why have plenty of research so please go on nevertheless nevertheless it's it's not a lived experience but it is a solid theory which I've shared with a number of people.
All the number of people that I've shared with exhibited significant pushback on my theory so this is inside your household I assume inside yes and friends.
Kabob stand casual barbecue chat with the Prime Minister exactly exactly often when you know there's a there's a single person.
In my orbit and they're saying I'm looking to find my special partner I suggest.
The best place to make it don't worry about swiping right on tinder and all that kind of stuff you never know you gonna find it's probably gonna be a question what quality go to office works.
Because it's a friendly environment, okay?
It's a fairly low pressure environment.
I mean, the type of person that shops for stationery, okay?
If you imagine this big filter,
you got the whole swarm of society.
There's only a certain type of person
that's interested in stationery
and is gonna go to Officeworks to shop for it.
And that's gonna be somebody
who's got their stuff together.
They value a bit of probably neatness and tidiness
because if you're into stationary,
that's what you usually like.
So I'm not saying go to the computer section.
I'm not saying go to the furniture section.
Don't go to the coffee section.
You gotta stick to the stationary section of Officeworks.
Look around, strike up a conversation
with another customer.
You never know where it might lead you.
- But what is it about stationary or stationary people?
- I think they're calm, I think they're kind,
and I think they're thoughtful.
Because people who deal in stationary,
they're the thinking type of person, okay?
They're the sort of person who has a home office.
You know, or they're managing their finance as well,
you know, because they need to keep a ledger book.
- Hmm.
- Right?
They're doing some art and craft at home,
and they're making a collage, right?
So they're peaceful, calm, nice people.
- If two people walk into an accessory kind of aisle,
They both reach out at the same time for the Logitech MX master in their hands mate. You're saying it's not gonna work out
No, you can't trust technology. Hmm
Can't you go stay away from the technology section of officeworks any bozo just going in there by a cheap mouse
Not having that it's got to be the pens and paper kind of area plus to your point
If you need to write down some contact information
We're better you got it then a post-it note aisle with some pens because they always have that little tester area where you can test
And that's a great point Jason and not only that you getting a chance to see their penmanship.
Yep are they a serial killer or are they fairly normal you can tell by how there are they going up to that and clipping out magazine letters and pasting them down on there like a you know ransom note or are they doing nice.
Swoopy writing are they buying red string to put up on their crazy wall.
Early warning signs I would call that.
I just think office works isn't it you may think you probably listen to singing this guy's an idiot no this is a solid theory I'm running with and have been running with for a number of years and if I wasn't married I would attempt to prove my theory correct let's just say my relationship.
Pulls apart suddenly I'm a single man once again where am I gonna go.
Basketball court.
True.
Oh and then Officeworks probably after.
Yeah and the pub, Drama Sorrows and then when I've recovered and I'm ready to rebound Officeworks.
That's my starting point and I think I'll meet a nice, in my case a nice lady but I'm not being gender specific here. I think you'll meet the nice person that you are looking for in an Officeworks.
Two questions on this.
Two questions.
Two questions.
Does this theory have a name, since it's been around for a while? And are there other office
supply stores in Australia, outside of Officeworks? Or is that really-
Well, that's why I was going to interject and say, it sounds like he just wants to meet people
at a news agency. That's the venue.
It is a shame. Like, in an earlier era, you probably would have said a news agency.
That would have been a great call. But unfortunately, they're hard to find.
That's like where your grandparents met were at the news agency. Hard to find.
Are you bereft of news agencies in Western Australia? Because we have them. I have one
down the road. We have several. Really? Oh, you're doing well.
They're the same shops. They're just persisting.
Well, just to show off with all of his news agencies.
It's not something to brag about. We just have officeworks.com.au.
15% off. Hemisphere views. Does it have a name? No, I haven't given it a name.
It's just the meet girls at Officeworks theory in my own mind.
I'm open to ideas.
If somebody has a title, then, you know, bring it on.
It's probably a topic for the Discord if people want to go there.
So if stationary is not your thing, though, you just don't even buy, like,
there's not a type of person where you're like, hey, let's go to the
office chair section.
Like, that's where I would go.
If I'm really into office chairs.
The opening account of worms.
Could we think that maybe Officeworks is just a collection of speed dating areas where you go in,
you find the area that best represents you, and then it's just a speed dating situation where
you just go from chair to chair to chair, from pen to pen to pen, stapler to stapler to stapler.
It's speed swiveling. That's what it is.
Yes. Yeah. I'm wondering if this could be expanded and this could be a new market for Officeworks.
Like office works after hours kind of a thing.
Office perks.
Yes.
There's a stamp card involved now.
Office perks.
That's pretty good.
I like that.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
There's potential in this.
I've got to admit because I've been so just solid on my particular theory that I've not explored the wider parameters and options that we have available.
That's good.
That's good.
and expand right you want land expand done the landing get the expanding going I think is what you want to do next that's where that series be funding will come in.
Yeah okay I think I think it's got legs.
I'm sure the people let let us know what you think is it a solid theory I think it is I really do.
Yes did you hear a lot of debate for a second of like if do I throw it or not.
Would you have you talk to anybody anywhere anytime yes he does correct okay if you could stumble across Natasha in an office works.
Would you have said why hello fair lady how do you feel about.
200 GSM paper? Are you a reflex kind of girl?
When you say fair lady, do you expect that I'm wearing a cravat on a horse in some Pride and Prejudice period piece?
Hello fair lady, I see you are looking at the tablets.
Well you are Martin, so...
I can assist you.
You do have a very formalised way of talking.
Of course, of course, yes. Well then I shall answer this in the appropriate accent.
No, do you want me to stop? I'll just continue with my normal formality.
Maybe the normal one.
normal yeah I think Jason's cringing rather it depends with with context or
reason I wouldn't have just walked up and said hey babe I see you checking out
the keyboards no doesn't work that way no one would say that anyway I reckon
the number of people in the world that line has been said at least once like I
I see you enjoy a felt tip. Let's discuss.
A felt tip? Goddammit, I knew that was happening.
I knew...
I walked into that one.
I knew that was gonna happen.
This is just in an explicit writing. Thank you, Andrew.
