I also have a surprise for you guys. You have a surprise? Vegemite. Awesome.
Never had it. Haven't tried it yet. Oh not at all? Is it even opened?
It's open. Haven't tried it. Smelled it. That's as far as I've gotten. So that could be today.
How is the aroma for you? It's indescribable. I've been trying to
figure out something to compare it to and it's just it's like it's a it's its
own thing. Is this a show? It is now. I mean there's like there it's there's
fruits there's vegetables there's this. You're taking what's an Australian
condiment a staple and turning it into what seems to be like a wine connoisseur
experience I've never seen anyone approach it like that. I mean I have to
What else is there right now, you know?
I have to take different foods and experience them.
I also have finger limes.
I haven't tried those yet either.
- Lovely.
So, I mean, now we've been talking about Vegemite
on and off in our chat,
and I'll be honest, I'm a Vegemite tragic.
I smear that stuff on like it's nobody's business.
Do you think that's something
that you'll be able to warm up to, Jason?
Because I do recommend, as Andrew said,
that you go for the light spreading,
maybe with some butter or margarine. That's what's interesting. It seems like people are very,
very, very polar opposite on this. They either really, really love it or it's just disgust all
the way down. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground where somebody would say, "Oh, if it was
on a table, I'd have it." It's like, you really go for it or you just don't want it at all.
So I ordered some because we kept talking about it. I got two jars. Fun fact. So I've got a two
for one deal so I hope I really really like it or we're gonna have two jars of
this in our refrigerator probably have a lifetime supply exactly so I don't know
I'm gonna try it at some point during this recording I think and hope that I
don't offend slash have you guys never talk to me again I've got a theory and a
tip for you just as in that conversation so my theory is that Americans don't
generally generally like it because they they spread it like peanut butter
They make it thick so that's a reason for the disgust. It's a user error.
They're not using the substance correctly. So that's my tip.
Also I noticed you said you're keeping it in the refrigerator. Don't do that.
It goes in the cupboard. Oh my apologies. It has not been in the
refrigerator. This is as room temperature as it gets. Perfect. You never need to
refrigerate that stuff. I would never. Never. I know better.
It's got a long half-life. It's fine.
[Music]
Hey, hello to both of you. This is our new podcast.
Oh yeah, that's right. I forgot we started a thing.
That's right. We should give some context. Who'd like to dive in?
dive in. Hold on, I'm about to eat vegamite. Yeah, no worries. Well, I mean, to everyone
who's listening, welcome to Hemispheric Views. This is really an audio experiment. It's a
journey for the three of us. Journey is a bit of a cringe-worthy word in my books, but
I'm going to use it because it is a journey. We're trying something new. This really spawned
from, I suppose, a pilot episode that we did on my podcast, Lounge Ruminator, and we enjoyed
it so much that we decided to make something more of it, try to make it a habit. And thank
you, dear listener, if you are there, I hope you are for joining us. Now, I get the feeling
with this break that Jason is actually diving into the Vegema. We're going to get his thought
in a moment. But what you can expect on this show is a bit of a tech chat, maybe some things
on culture, books, films, whatever sort of tickles our fancy. And given the fact that
Andrew and I come from Australia. Andrew on the West Coast in the city of Perth, me
on the East Coast in the city of Wollongong, and Jason from US&A. There's going to be some
difference in accents and views. So I hope you enjoy the ride with us.
So Jason, do you have any thoughts for us? This is really, really unique. Wow. It's bold.
It's strong and I'm, I don't, I don't know what to do with it.
Um, what if, what if you spread it on here?
Well, okay.
So that might be part of the problem.
Um, yeah, so I, I don't have any toast right now or bread rather.
So what I've done is I've taken a Triscuit.
Maybe you have those, maybe you don't, I don't know.
Yeah, it's a fairly plain cracker, salted, and I've put a thin layer of the Vegemite on the cracker.
It's a salted cracker with salted Vegemite, okay.
It's okay. I love some salt, so we're good there. I'm okay with the salt level.
And I just, I cannot for the life of me give any context to what this tastes like. It's not bad.
I just don't know what I would do with it.
You know, like it doesn't, there's not a place in my life where I'm like,
oh, you know what?
That would be a perfect place for Vegemite.
I'll eat it though.
I think it's actually, I think it could, it could grow on me.
It's breakfast time.
That is the perfect time and place for Vegemite.
That's as intended.
I'm seeing it more as a lunch food, but I could see a breakfast maybe in my future with this.
Yeah.
But my next question, I didn't do any research on Vegemite at all, but what do you, either of you
have any idea why does it exist? What is it for? It feels like the kind of food that came about as
like a military ration or something where people weren't getting enough B vitamins or whatever.
So they're like, you know what, you're eating this because we're just going to bombard you
with vitamins. Andrew, do you know? I have a vague recollection and it's,
I've done no research and this is based on a memory rather than fact.
I think it is a byproduct of...
Because it's a yeast extract and I think it's a byproduct of brewing for alcohol.
Australians big drinkers, big drinking nation, always have been.
So I think basically in the early days of Australia, nothing went to waste.
So they brewed beer and then said,
we've got all this gunk, what do we do with it?
How do we make it useful?
And so let's make a-
- That totally makes sense.
- That's my, it's probably a glorified story,
but there must be an element of truth in it somehow.
- Yeah, and then flowing on from there,
what Jason said about the vitamin B
and all the other nutrients.
I mean, Andrew, you would know this,
and if any Australians are listening,
that old jingle about being a happy little Vegemite
pumped out constantly on the radio
and it's a bit of a legacy advertisement.
- I'm just thinking I could probably sing
that Vegemite song right now.
I'm not going to, 'cause I'm not at that stage yet
of my comfort levels, but you know, give it time.
Might be able to sing the song.
Well, Jason, I am incredibly impressed with you.
You're powering through that.
That is excellent.
- Thank you, I appreciate that.
And I think we can follow up in the future
if you do happen to try it on toast
or with other recommended foods like avocado,
really nice with avocado.
We'll see what happens.
We move on to some of the things
that we've maybe put in our notes here.
Andrew, do you wanna kick it off?
You've put a very interesting initial topic here
for sort of the world of technology.
What do you have to say about ads?
You're a bit passionate about that?
- Bit passionate in that I really don't like them.
And I know that they're the thing
that makes the internet go round, right?
That's how the money wheel turns.
But I'm not a big fan of corporate internet anyway.
So if corporate internet finds life
a little bit more difficult because of me
and my desire to block ads, then so be it.
So I think for the longest time,
I've run an ad blocker of some sort or another,
but in probably about a year ago,
if not maybe even a little bit more than that,
maybe, yeah, I got interested in something called Piehole,
which has to be the greatest name in naming history,
I think, calling something a piehole.
It is an ad blocker that runs specifically
on a raspberry pie.
And I was so interested in this that I bought a raspberry pie
for the sole reason of running Piehole on it.
And so the way it works is rather than the typical way where you have an ad blocker that
is running in your browser or on your device, running the rules over the top of anything
that comes into it, PyHalt actually goes in between, it lives on your network and goes
in between your devices and your router.
So it becomes the very first port of call in from your service provider.
And so the 'it' at that first point of call blocks ads immediately.
Which means the computer or the device isn't doing any work in blocking, it's just running
default and it sends us, you know, the requests come in and they don't get passed through
to the device.
So the ads get blocked by the pi-hole and then the rest of the authorized traffic goes
through.
It is superb and it's quick.
You don't notice it.
And it's just a wonderful, wonderful piece of technology developed by a bunch of nerds
that I recommend wholeheartedly.
And it is so worth investing in a Raspberry Pi just to get this thing up and running,
which is not even that complicated.
You don't need to be a Unix guru to make it work.
So yeah, I just wanted to say that I think this PiHole is the best ad blocker technology
you can find.
Yeah, I've used it in the past as well.
It's I don't currently use it.
I now also have used the, we used to have the Eero Wi-Fi system, the mesh stuff, and
they had something similar.
If you had like Eero Plus or whatever, you could get some kind of ad blocking thing.
The Pi-hole thing I think is really awesome.
I like that it works for every device regardless of what device it is.
So even if you have some random thing on the internet, it doesn't matter.
You don't have to have a specific ad blocker for that device.
It just works at the network level, which is awesome.
The only issue I ever had with it was I was always deathly afraid that as with anything
with the Raspberry Pi, running my whole world on the Raspberry Pi that's in a closet that
I inevitably forget about and then if it dies, I'm stuck figuring out why does my whole house
not work anymore?
And that, I mean, it's a little irrational, but it's like the Raspberry Pi, they almost
work too good where they just kind of disappear and you forget they exist.
And then if anything happens, eventually you go, "Oh, right, the Raspberry Pi, I have to
go reboot that."
But the Pi-hole thing is cool.
It is not irrational at all, because I have the same thought.
I've spent all this money, I've got a UPS thing for my power supply, I've bought the
Google Wi-Fi mesh network, I've got all this expensive Mac equipment, all backed up by
a $40 Raspberry Pi.
And I do look at it, it sits down just near me, so I can kind of see its little glowing
red light, and I check on it from time to time, and occasionally do some software updates
on it and just make sure I'm giving it appropriate TLC.
Yeah, the whole house runs off something that's powered by a micro USB cable.
Like that's kind of scary, but cool at the same time.
We've come a long way.
And if it goes wrong, and I'm not around, my family will just, they won't know what
to do because they won't know how to reconfigure the Raspberry Pi.
So I need to leave explicit instructions upon my death.
For each of you, has the Raspberry Pi taken on some sort of role or function that no other
device has?
I mean, Andrew, you mentioned the ads.
Jason, you said it's easy to forget in the cupboard.
Can you speak a bit more about it?
For me, it's been on and off.
They're very much a hobby platform.
I mean, you could really use one as just your computer day to day, depending on what you're
going to do.
But for me, it's always, there's always a little fun projects that come out every
couple of months or years where it's like, Oh yeah, just throw it in a raspberry
pie and you're good, which is great because you don't have to experiment with
your actual computer.
If the thing catches on fire, who cares?
Cause again, they're, they're very inexpensive and somewhat disposable in
the sense that if something breaks, you can just burn it to the ground and start
over.
Um, the pie hole, it was the last one that I did.
I don't currently use one for anything.
I was using one for Homebridge for a while,
which is another, well actually, yeah,
we could talk about HomeKit as well,
but Homebridge is another system
that kind of runs on top of a Raspberry Pi,
or on top of anything.
I don't use it for that anymore,
'cause now I had an, what is it,
an Intel NUC computer, the N-U-C,
little next unit of computing,
or I think is what it was called.
I had one of those laying around,
so it was like, I can either use that or a Raspberry Pi,
So I'll just use that because I have it
But yeah home bridge is another big one that runs on top of Raspberry Pi that I think people might or might not know about
Yeah, I'm not really much of a hardware guy because I know a lot of the projects with Raspberry Pi are tied back to you
Know put a little screen on it or have little LEDs telling you different status messages and that kind of thing
I'm really not into any of that stuff
And I've looked around at different Raspberry Pi projects and none of them have ever been so exciting that I thought oh, yes
I'm gonna do that
Literally the piehole is the only thing I do with this
I sort of tooled around with it for a few minutes when I first bought it and I was like yeah
I'm not really into this
So yeah, it's a single-purpose computing device for me. It's an appliance
And if it does die, I'll probably buy another one and just carry on using it
That's what makes it so cool though
Is it like you don't have to use a thousand dollar computer to run this so you can just kind of tinker and try things
Whereas if you had to use a thousand dollar computer to run piehole
Probably wouldn't do it. It just seems like a little excessive but for 20 30 40 dollars
I mean you can get raspberry pies now, I think
$15 or something like that, which is just
insane
Yeah, I bought the starter kit because I had no idea what I was doing
So it came with all the little you know
The box to put it in and the extra bits and pieces and but you yeah
If you stick around you wouldn't even need to do that. So, um, yeah, it's a great thing
The one thing I sort of raised a question for me though in terms of ad blocking
I wanted to ask the two of you. Do you use any?
In on device ad blockers because I do have one blocker as well that I use for my iOS devices when I'm
Not on the local network
Which I've been pretty happy with just wondering if you guys have had any experience because I know set up has another one
Ad guard, I think it is
And I just it seemed it seems a bit heavy
But I was just curious if you guys have any experience and what is best in class ad blocking from a software point of view
at the moment
For me, I don't use anything anymore. Honestly
I used to try using various ones for iOS and Mac OS,
mostly just because it's hard to know if anything's ever actually doing anything.
What does ad blocking really mean?
Is it blocking just tracking?
Is it blocking visually what I'm seeing?
I don't know. Everything felt like,
"Oh, I'm seeing an ad.
Why is it not being blocked or is that on a white list or something?"
I don't know. I just gave up on all of that
and moved to, my personal favorite blocker is cash.
If I could buy something to not see an ad,
that's my primary way to go.
Let's see, like a Hulu, right?
Where a Hulu, I think they have different tiers,
but you can either pay for it and still have ads,
which I don't get at all, but okay,
or you can pay to never see an ad ever again.
Perfect, that's my best way to go.
I don't wanna see ads on that ever again.
YouTube Premium was another one that I don't currently have,
but you pay them nine bucks a month
and nothing has ads ever, which is great.
I use YouTube DL now,
so I don't deal with any of that anyway.
But for me, I think if I can, I'd rather just pay someone,
'cause at least I feel like then
there's still an even exchange of me giving them something.
Instead of giving them 30 seconds of time,
I'm giving them X dollars a month.
So for me, I think that's my best ad blocker,
but for Safari and Firefox and everything else,
I don't have anything on there anymore.
I'm not running anything network-wise to block stuff.
And I guess just selective biological blocking
is like another way that I go about it,
where like, I just don't see it anymore.
there's just so much crap that it kind of overwhelms you
and you just don't really notice it anymore.
You know, thankfully we don't have the big like banner pop-ups
or pop-overs or any of that stuff anymore.
But yeah, I think just not seeing it
is really the way that I go now.
And if I can, I will try and pay for a service.
And honestly, if it's something where
there's an option of ads and paying,
and I don't feel like it's worth going the paying route,
it kind of makes me question,
do I really even want what this is providing?
- Yeah, I totally agree with what you're saying, Jason,
about paying to get rid of ads.
Like you, Andrew, I do use OneBlocker.
I experimented a little bit
with the DuckDuckGo Safari extension.
I liked that, but it wasn't actually clear from installation
whether it would be blocking ads
or just tracking or whatever.
Settled on OneBlocker, it's the same across iOS,
iPadOS, macOS.
But relating to what you were saying, Jason,
about paying for stuff,
streaming and the other things you said, totally agree.
But things like Twitterific, for example,
if I'm browsing Twitter,
just the fact that that leads
to an ad-free Twitter experience,
even just using a site like micro.blog,
which we discussed in our pilot episode,
just orchestrating and finding environments
where you can avoid ads,
which for me is a very troubling thing
because I studied an advertising
and marketing major at university,
and here I am detesting the very thing
that is my craft.
So, you know, it's an existential crisis for me.
- Yeah, that totally makes sense.
But at least for what you're talking about,
that is wholly different than what internet advertising
has become today.
So I think at least in that regard,
you don't have to feel too bad.
(laughs)
And in terms of Safari too,
like with the new Mac OS and new iOS that are coming up,
there's some kind of Safari,
I don't know if I wouldn't know if I would call it a blocker,
but I am on the beta of Mac OS.
I have noticed that there is,
at least there's something that says in the last X days,
I have, you know, I being Safari have blocked X, Y, Z.
So I like that fact that it at least is telling you
what it's doing instead of just kind of this,
we have a list of 40 billion things we're blocking
and you never really know, did you block any of them
or are you just, you know, in the way of what I'm doing?
So I think it'll be interesting to see what comes of that,
of the stuff that's just kind of baked in.
I'll leave that stuff on,
'cause I don't see any issue in doing that.
- Yeah, the naming and shaming is a powerful idea.
- Right, yeah, when it says that, you know,
Facebook had tried to track you on the last 63 links
that you clicked, it's like, oh, that's, I didn't,
you know, for, I think a lot of people,
they don't realize that's even happening.
They hear ad blocking,
they just think they're not seeing the, you know,
punch the monkey ad in the corner,
but when it starts to say, you know,
everything you're viewing,
90% of what you're viewing is being tracked by Facebook,
and then the next one is, you know, Twitter,
and then the next one is DoubleClick,
and then blah, blah, blah, all the way down the line,
you're like, wow, there's like,
it also makes you realize there's like three companies
really doing all of it.
So I think that's gonna be pretty powerful,
and it seems like people are already,
well, people being companies are already upset about
the Apple blocking stuff that, you know,
Our revenue is going to go down and all that.
It's like, well, yeah, it's it's hard to feel sorry for that industry, isn't it?
I mean, they've feasted on the the data, the data exhaust for such a long time.
And now that they're being they're being held up, a mirror is being held up.
And I guess saying, look, people, this is what they're getting from you.
And Joe Average had no idea and has the opportunity now to say, no, I don't want
to give some random company that information.
- Yeah, or continue to say they don't care.
Okay, that's fine.
You know, I think most people don't,
well, I mean, I hate to throw on most people,
a lot of people on the internet genuinely don't care
and would love to give you, you know,
show me 50 ads instead of me giving you 99 cents
or whatever.
Okay, that's fine.
But I think for the people that don't know or do care,
that should be way more transparent.
And like I said, with the Safari thing,
where it just blatantly calls out,
so-and-so looked at you 18 times yesterday.
I think that's not unreasonable.
- And then you hear people complaining that,
oh, it must be, they must've enabled my microphone
to figure out that I was interested in a holiday
to Southeast Asia.
It's like, no, they probably just figured it out
from your browsing and what you're looking at
and what it's amazingly amounted profiling they can do.
They don't need to turn on the microphone.
There's way less technically complex ways for them to find this stuff out.
I think it's interesting that to your point,
people would think that it takes something that far to figure things out on them.
When no, it's really just you click on a lot of stuff.
I don't think you realize how much stuff you click on every single day.
You go to do one search and you fall down one rabbit hole links,
and here's another links and this is tied to that.
And all of a sudden you've somehow visited 300 unique links
when you were looking for one thing.
And it doesn't take much to build a social picture of you
out of just where you're going.
- Absolutely, it only takes one like.
- To bring this back around to the pie hole,
just to let you guys know that I've got 94,
93,956 domains on the block list.
And I've got 8.4% of the requests
in the last 24 hour period have been blocked.
So 47,000 requests and 4,000 blocked.
So it does a pretty impressive job
with that kind of stuff.
- And you're enjoying that visibility and transparency?
- Yeah, that's fun to look at.
It's always good to look at the chart, right?
And nobody knows then that I'm browsing for holidays,
which I'm not because I'm housebound.
- That's right, they're imagined holidays.
Now, actually that's a good point to segue
'cause you brought the pie hole back
and the mention of being stuck at home.
Jason, you mentioned HomeKit
and how that relates to the Raspberry Pi.
Can you tell us a little bit about your HomeKit setup
or how you sort of approach this?
- I love HomeKit.
I love, love, love HomeKit.
I think it's had a rough go
in terms of being a product over the last couple of years.
I think kind of probably like Vegemite a little bit
to wrap that back around,
people either love or hate HomeKit.
I'm in the love camp for sure.
I think it's just, it's what we've as nerds and geeks
always wanted technology to be
is where you could speak to your house, right?
And actually have it perform things and be useful.
So I, we, my wife and I both love HomeKit.
We use it all the time.
I just wrote something the other day,
just kind of recapping,
'cause I realized I hadn't really thought about
what we were doing in regard to HomeKit in a while.
We recently moved, so it was a nice chance
to do a clean slate on what we wanted to do
in terms of HomeKit.
So we have all kinds of stuff, you know,
from very basic lights.
We redid all of the blinds/shades in our house.
Those are all HomeKit now, so at any moment,
every shade in the house can go up, down,
or anything in between.
We've got HomePods all over the place.
So, you know, different camera things,
just 'cause it's fun.
Doorbells, the whole deal.
But yeah, so for me, HomeKit has just become,
It's become another checkbox, honestly, too,
for when I'm looking for new things where,
for instance, it was time to get a new TV.
So it was like, okay, what does the TV need to have?
Okay, well, it's gotta have the basics,
4K, this size, HDR, blah, blah, blah, OLED,
and it's gotta have HomeKit in it and AirPlay too
because we know TVs, at least currently,
still are one of the last few electronics
that you don't buy every damn year.
So it's gotta have it now.
It's kinda like cars, where if you get a car
that doesn't have CarPlay, well,
you're not gonna have CarPlay for a long time.
So for the TV, we definitely wanted to make sure
that was in there.
And I was talking about HomeBridge before,
which is, it's another one of those little cool
geek projects, I think, that just exploded,
kinda like the Piehole, where there are things
that are connected to the internet,
but they're not HomeKit.
So it's kinda this weird, like, in-between zone
where they went just far enough to get a Wi-Fi chip in there
so it could sort of work with some horrific app
that was built in 12 seconds,
but not far enough to actually go the whole route
to work with HomeKit.
So HomeBridge is this nice little layer in between
where it does this kind of translation layer of saying,
okay, I'm gonna talk to your quote unquote smart device
and translate that into HomeKit speak
so that it can be within your home app
and you can do all the things you can normally do.
So we use that actually a lot at our last house
'cause we had a good number of things
that just didn't have HomeKit but were connected.
Now, because we moved and it was kind of again,
fresh slate to start with,
it was like anything we buy has to have HomeKit in it
or we're not buying it.
It was kind of the Apple Pay route all over again
where if they don't have Apple Pay, I'm not going there.
But if it doesn't have HomeKit, we're not buying it.
So now basically everything is native,
which is kind of weird to say now
'cause it felt like it was never gonna get there.
It felt like the kind of technology
that it's gonna be in a couple higher end things
and you're gonna pay for it and that's about it.
But it feels really like it's everywhere now
for the most part.
And I think a big part of that is when they transitioned,
it used to be, you know, buy this chip from us
to put in your thing to implement this
to now it's just software.
So that's good.
But I think, you know, it's got security built in.
It's security first from everything I can tell.
Obviously, I'm not a security researcher
diving into this thing to see what's going on.
But in general, I trust if it's got HomeKit in it
that it's treating my privacy as it should be.
Like with HomeKit Secure Video,
my video from cameras is not going up
to some random cloud thing
that eventually will be bought by Google.
It's just sitting in my iCloud storage,
which is also great because now my two terabytes of storage is actually getting used.
See Jason, when I'm hearing you speak about this, the only image that I have in my head
is the opening of the first installment of Back to the Future where Doc Brown's dog food
is being opened automatically and we're just panning along.
Your entire house is just like this automated experiment.
That's what I'm trying to go for.
Yeah, that's the end goal for sure.
Sounds like you're a real poster boy for HomeKit.
That's impressive.
Oh.
And it's so different to my experience.
Martin, do you use it?
The extent of my HomeKit experience is two HomePods in a stereo pair and going down the
route or route for American listeners, I will respect both sides, of hooking up an iPod
Hi-Fi to an AirPort Express to add it to the sort of audio connected experience.
Do you know what I mean?
The old iPod Hi-Fi?
Steve Jobs's Revenge music product.
Yeah, because I have one of those and love it.
So I added that to have that on the Airplay 2 network.
But no, I haven't dived into the world of cameras or lighting and stuff.
That's the same for you, Andrew?
I have it to a small degree.
So I have a home, a single home pod.
And really, in terms of the automation stuff, we've got some lights.
And that's really as far as we've gone.
And the lights I got were the LIFX ones.
So they weren't the Philips Hue that had the hub thingamabob that they use.
It was just every bulb is connected directly to the internet in its own right.
And I have to say, I haven't been loving it.
It strikes me as... it always seems slow.
The amount of times either I ask it to turn the light on and then I stand there in the
dark for 10 seconds and then the light goes on or Siri will say I'm having a hard time
connecting right now and then it will happen and it's like there doesn't there seems to
be this massive disconnect between what the Siri HomeKit management software thinks is
going on and what the light is actually doing and so many times I just think why can't I
walk over the wall and turn the switch on. It's like this this seems like cool in theory but not
cool in practice. And then there's the human elements of it as well. I feel really, I sort of
have to, I feel a bit self-conscious like yelling out to turn lights on and annoying everybody else
in the house who doesn't need to know that I want a light turned on. And then I also feel like I have
to overthink it because rather than just the connection to brain, I need light, flick,
it's I need light. How do I ask for a light? Which room is it in? It's in the library?
Yeah, yeah, okay. Then asking the question. I feel like there's this huge cognitive overhead
going on when I have to just turn on.
You almost feel like you're initiating a command in Shakespearean iambic pentameter or something
like Siri, "Wouldest thou turn on the light?" And then you wait five seconds and then it activates.
And you have to think carefully with Siri because if you don't do it right,
she won't respect your wishes. So yeah, I've had a hard time with it. I'm not at the point
where I want to run it off because I like some of the time-based automations, like turn it on
when somebody arrives home. I really love that. That's probably the winning feature for me. The
the garage light goes on when I roll up by proximity.
You know, and I would like to get some cameras
and that kind of thing,
'cause I think that'd be cool.
But I'm wondering whether in Australia,
we are limited by range, supply and price.
'Cause it always seems really expensive
when I've looked at it.
And I just think, are people really like,
it's a good question, Jason.
Are you really paying that much money for these devices?
'Cause they're super expensive here.
Is it cheaper in the US?
It's pretty easy to assemble?
I don't know what the pricing difference is.
I mean, I think a lot of the stuff is--
or can be-- pretty pricey.
Yeah, I don't know.
I'd have to look at the difference in the pricing.
But I would imagine it's probably more prevalent here,
just in terms of availability, because of the fact
that I think it's not a cell phone, right?
Or it's not a computer.
so it's not gonna have the same worldwide
want from everybody.
So I'm sure it's probably more prevalent here.
But I definitely feel when, Andrew,
you're talking about this weird,
I don't know what to say, how to get stuff to work.
And then everybody has to,
the other part that's interesting too
is with a phone or a computer,
you can put whatever apps or whatever things
you want on there 'cause it's yours.
But when you're talking about a house,
all of a sudden now you're making decisions
that affect other human beings every single day.
And I think that's something that you really,
if you're gonna do things with HomeKit,
you really need to plan that out
and make sure everyone is on board with it.
Because when you go to then put in,
at least, so it used to be like this, right?
You'd put in all the lights,
and then it was like, okay,
in order to turn the lights on in this room,
you have to use this app.
In order to turn the lights on in that room,
you gotta use that app.
Don't use the wall switch,
'cause if you use the wall switch,
it's gonna mess everything up
and everything's gonna go weird.
Now all the lights are blue.
So that, no one likes that, because that's just stupid.
You have anybody that comes over to your house
and they flick a light switch,
now the whole room is blue
and they're like, "What the hell just happened?"
So it's a major thing you need to worry about
in terms of future-proofing your house,
'cause the last thing you wanna do
is just have everybody upset
when they wanna turn on a light switch.
I think for me, like the Lutron system,
which is, it's smart switches instead of bulbs.
So you have a normal light switch on the wall,
any person can walk in and touch it
and it works like a light switch,
but at the same time I can still say,
"Hey, turn on the lights."
So plan, plan, plan if you're thinking
about doing anything with HomeKit,
because it will affect everyone in your house
or anyone that ever comes to your house.
And that can be really frustrating,
especially when you want to be the person that's like,
oh, look at all this cool stuff I got.
And then somebody comes over
and uses it like a normal human being,
which is something you didn't think of
because you're a weird nerd and everything breaks.
And now they're like, yeah, cool system.
It doesn't work at all.
Now you're just walking with your tail between your legs.
Like, oh, well, it was cool.
- It's good that you're at least considerate
of other people entering your home.
I think the major turnoff for me has been,
even though HomeKit, as you've described, Jason,
is unifying all of this stuff and making it easy.
It's this, yes, as you said, Andrew,
the theory is that it should all work together nicely
and just be super easy,
but suddenly you're adding all of this extra complexity
to your life.
I could just walk over to the light switch and flick it,
and it would work as it always has,
or I could assemble all of these goods
that will soon be obsolete
because the newest Phillips Hue will be out.
And so I don't mean to denigrate your experience.
I actually think it's quite cool,
and I'd love to try it.
I think that that's just the thing that stops me
from crossing over the line to put it together
and suddenly have all of this other material floating around.
Plus there's also another reference comes to mind.
I don't know if either of you have seen
that treehouse of horror episode in The Simpsons
where The Simpsons have an automated home
that's voiced by Pierce Brosnan that tries to kill Homer
when he becomes infatuated with Marge.
That sort of technological dystopia does enter my mind.
So first of all, yes, your lights are turning blue
and you don't expect it
and suddenly it's trying to kill you.
So who knows where that's going?
- That's fair, that's fair.
Yeah, I could see that.
And I think that the automation part,
like you just said, where I think we're not there yet,
right, having to still tell it what to do is stupid.
Like that's not cool at all.
But it's little, like I see little things here and there
where it's like, I have a light strip in behind the TV
and then some other lights in the quote TV room.
And when I turn the TV on,
it just tells everything else to turn on.
And that actually has just been working flawlessly.
And those are like the little things where
when we get to that level, you know, when I get home,
it sees my phone, turns on certain lights, unlocks the door.
That kind of stuff is where I want to get to.
I think we've still got quite a ways to go though.
- I feel like you're living in the future.
I'm still struggling with HDMI CEC.
- Oh, talk about a train wreck of a system.
Yeah, that's, don't worry.
It still doesn't work very well.
I mean, we just, with the newest TV you can get and still CEC is like hit or miss.
It sort of works, but I just have four remote controls lined up.
I'm like, I'm just not even going to try and integrate these.
It is not worth it.
It generally works pretty well with the Apple TV, but sometimes I click the button and I
see that little light come on the Apple TV and I'm like, oh, it's working.
And then nothing happens with the TV.
And you wait for that reassuring click like the life has come to the television.
So I agree.
It's a bit all over the place.
Not to mention there are seven letters in that initialism.
I don't know why it's so long.
HDMI CEC.
It's exhausting for something that's supposed to be short.
Yeah.
And I just wish it was consistent.
It seems like when it's one of those great things where when it works, it's, wow, this
is cool.
And then when it doesn't work, you're just sitting there like, what?
How does even, it just worked two minutes ago
and now it's not working at all.
Or like part of it'll work where it'll turn the thing on,
but then the commands don't get sent back
and to control volume or whatever.
CEC is maddening at the same time where it's like,
I mean, I guess it works enough to where I like it,
but geez, come on.
- I have a question for both of you
just to guide this elsewhere.
I mean, you said Jason that your wife is really into the home kit stuff.
Andrew, I'm not sure about you and your family and tech and everything, but are both of your respective families really on board with the products and services that you introduce or you try to push on them?
Or how does that work?
What's the acceptance like?
Maybe starting off with you, Andrew.
Well, with the lights and stuff, I think we've got got people on board.
The kids have no idea that it's even happening.
And my my wife deals with it. She's okay with it. She uses in terms of
Shouting things to Siri. She's asking she's sending timers all the time. That's kind of I'm playing music
That's about the extent of the use of that kind of level of automation
But I sure she'll say she'll talk to it and ask for the lights to be on and off and that kind of thing
with regards to other technology
They don't get into it like I do I think that's probably not that surprising
All right you Jason
It's you're telling me your family's not excited about the new fan you put in your NAS. They're not they're not really in my action. I
Told I told my wife I did that and she's like, that's nice
I'm so excited about I put it in an extra topic on today's show. I thought the people want to know
I was excited about it still want to hear about you do you want cuz it's like why I
Clicked on a link just to go look and see what it looked like
It's a lovely fan I should just I'll just deal with it now it's the knock to a knock to a fan
Replacing they had to have been the cheapest junkiest fan in an OWC Thunder Bay
A Thunderbolt hard drive array
Because um yeah, and it was I was so excited about getting this thing and then I realized that
It's a Thunderbolt device
So that it has to be right next to the computer because the cables could only be short
otherwise you get data transmission loss and
It was so noisy and I've had it for a while, and I've just put up with it
I got to the yesterday. I was like I can't deal with this anymore
I need to solve this problem now is doing my head in so it was you know quickly
Onto the Google's you find the forum where other people with this productive said like no you've got it
Yes, it's rubbish the one they they promote it as whisper quiet, and it isn't it's a Chinese $2
junk fan
And everybody was saying no you need to get the knock sure okay
If that's what if that's what they say, that's what I do
Fortunately, there was a local
PC retailer, you know, the sort of the PC shops where you go in there and I was just gonna ask
Do you guys have cool like PC stores still cuz that's not really a thing here anymore
Yeah, yeah, we've got we've got a number of them and this place, you know
You go on I checked online and they have the full warehouse sort of search search inventory system
I found the one I wanted quickly jumped in the car drove down, you know, 10 15 minutes away
Drove he got it had to get past it was the stereotypical PC IT guy
And he was sort of like, oh
what do you want this for and
Explain yourself
I'm trying to negotiate buying the fan.
It's like, this is the one I want.
Are you sure that's the one you want?
Let's really check.
And I even took the old one in.
I was like, look, see, I'm replacing this with that.
Let's have a closer look.
So he opens it up.
I'm like, don't take it out of its packaging.
That's part of the fun is Noctua
and they have nice packaging and you're ruining my thrill.
Yeah, and then he said, oh, what's it for?
I was like, "Oh, it's for a Raid Array,
"a Thunderbolt Raider."
"Thunderbolt, what?
"Is that a NAS?"
I'm like, "No."
(both laughing)
And then I went into like,
I have to justify my existence.
And I was saying like,
"Well, it's actually, this Raid Array is replacing."
I used to have a QNAP NAS and it got old
and I decided that this was a better way to go.
I shouldn't have done that.
Should've just bought another NAS.
I didn't want another device to manage, man.
I just wanted storage.
- Cool, thanks for your input.
I'll go ahead and do that in the past
when this already happened.
- It didn't stop there, it didn't stop there.
He said, so what sort of computer are you plugging into?
I was like, I know where this is going.
- Oh no.
- I was like, an iMac?
I've got a philosophical problem with Apple.
I just think they don't use standard parts.
(laughing)
- Oh.
- He was like, "Oh, you know, what's wrong with USB?"
I mean, USB, and I felt like getting into it,
I was like saying, "Yeah, Apple revolutionized USB, dude.
They were the first ones with it."
But no, he just wanted to get on his little rant.
And I finally--
- Not to mention USB-C is also used by other companies.
But yeah, continue.
- Yeah, so I finally, finally managed to convince him
that that was the one I wanted.
Here's my money.
Can I pay, please?
Get out of there, go home, install it.
The thing is whisper quiet.
It's so good.
So yeah, it even comes with little silicon screws,
which aren't really screws.
They're just like little prongs to stop any,
like if it was metal, it would vibrate against one another.
So silicon just holds it.
- So to be clear, you did not invite him to your house
to help with installation?
- No, no, I didn't think he would be helpful.
(laughing)
I'm surprised you didn't offer.
You sounded tremendously friendly.
I'm starting to take back what I was saying about having cool computer stores that are local.
Maybe not.
Can I just ask you, Andrew, was anyone else in the shop?
There was one lady who was just sort of working the register, if you feel like to put it that way.
Right. So he was just very keen to have a conversation with you.
He just needed a friend.
I think so.
Didn't have the social skills.
Yeah.
And he was clearly just the guy who assembles the PCs in the back room.
You know, I don't think they let him out much.
I was waiting for you to get to the part about using it with a Mac, because I knew
that was just going to be all bad.
Icing on the cake.
I was getting worried that there was that.
You're honestly going to say, I'm sorry, we can't sell it to you.
You know, you're not.
This is incompatible with a Mac.
And you're like, it's not.
Okay.
It's the wrong format.
Imagine the look on his face.
Imagine the look on his face had you said,
I'm running Linux.
His head would have exploded with joy.
- I think you should go back to this shop
and continue the story
and just see how far you can push these buttons.
- All right, all right.
I'll take that as a challenge.
Challenge for the week.
- No pressure, but you know, just go back and just say,
you know, I've just been really enjoying
all that the Apple platform has to offer
and et cetera, et cetera.
List the advantages, just see what he says.
You know it can run Windows as well, mate.
(laughing)
- Oh, look, he's gonna have an aneurysm
or something over there.
You gotta be careful.
- Now look, that was a completely unfair sidebar
'cause we were about to ask Jason about his family
and how they manage technology and devices.
So let's loop back to that.
- Oh yeah, I mean, for my wife and I
are the same person in that regard.
Like we were into the same stuff
and we're both equally, I think,
excited about all forms of technology really.
So we don't really have any,
there's really not been any issues.
I'm sure there's been crap that I've purchased
and implemented just assuming that it was fine.
And apologies in advance if that's happened,
but I think for the most part,
everything has been pretty good.
I think we're both equally frustrated though,
when if there's that time where we say,
"Hey, so and so do whatever and it doesn't work."
Or like the CEC thing where it's like,
"Hey, we bought this TV and we paid all this money
"because it does all these cool things
"and then it doesn't do it."
It's like, okay.
But I don't think that's any different than anything,
if you bought something for your kitchen
that was supposed to do one thing that didn't.
I think we're both very particular though
about what we buy in terms of aesthetics
and in the quality of something, and we're both very picky,
probably far more so than is healthy.
- That's great.
I mean, in my case, Natasha, my wife,
has been incredibly accepting
of a lot of the technological suggestions
that I've given her, mainly on the hardware side of things.
She's sort of become, I suppose, the tech person
at her school where she teaches.
Where the boundary lies, though,
when my never-ending deluge of suggestions when it comes to services or apps comes in.
That's where she goes, "Okay, look, I know you love RSS Martin, I know you're all about
the open web and, you know, your micro.blog and stuff, but you just need to step back
because I'm just comfortable scrolling through Instagram where my friends are."
So I think some wives or partners are subjected to more of this than others.
I did see a tweet the other day where this guy said that he discovered that his wife had a folder
on her phone that said his name next to shit. I think it was Adam's shit or something. And all
of the apps that he had recommended had just been put into this folder. So she can have them there
to show him when necessary, but she knows where to relegate them. So as far as I'm aware, Natasha
has no such folder, but she's very patient with me. That is fantastic. I love that. I mean, it's
It's in our nature to try to, I mean, it's excitement, right?
It's all out of, it's out of love.
I think we get super passionate about stuff
and really excited about things
and immediately just think, well, I like it.
That means everyone does, obviously.
And it's like, oh, you gotta use this.
You have to use this.
And then it's somehow becomes our job for whatever reason
that we have to sell people on something
that we didn't make, we get no profit from,
we're probably gonna have to support it,
but yet we sit there and just try like hell
that you have to use this, you gotta, you have to.
Oh my God, you have to do this.
Like, like 1Password is something that they've used forever
and I sit there and I try to sell everyone on it.
You have to use this, you must use 1Password,
your passwords suck, you have to do this.
And they're just like, no, I, you know,
I use password 123, it works for everything, it's great.
And if I have to, I'll add a exclamation point at the end
and then it's a great password.
- Yeah, people would have buttoned to say,
look, I do have one password for everything.
What are you talking about?
- Exactly, they literally do.
And it's like, no, no, you gotta have this thing
and it's the system.
And then you got this other password.
Now you gotta remember.
So now I've already given them another password,
which is something they don't wanna have to remember.
And then you gotta put all your stuff in there.
You know, spend all this time getting it all looking right
and then working and, oh, by the way, no, it's not free.
It's gonna cost you $80 a year
or whatever the hell it costs now.
And then, oh man, you tell somebody
something costs anything more than free
and holy hell does their head explode.
Even if they're on board with it,
which is, I think that's something that drives me so nuts
is you'll do something on a computer or phone or whatever
and they're like, "Oh, what did you just do?
"How did you do that?
"Oh, it's this sweet app.
"I just typed three characters in it
and it just does my laundry.
And they're like, oh man, that's amazing.
How do I get that?
Oh, you just go in the app store and download it.
Oh cool, immediately.
Is it free?
Well, no, it's not free.
I just told you it does your laundry
when you type three characters.
Like, why would that be free?
And they're like, oh, oh, well, how much is it?
Oh, it's 3.99.
3.99, oh my God, oh, geez.
"Yeah, this is ridiculous."
I'm like, "Oh, hell, fine."
That's, you know, whatever.
But anyway, with the one password,
I think is the one the most where
I try to get people into it so badly
and it generally doesn't really go well.
The people that wanna use 1Password
or something like it, you know, LastPass, whatever,
they pretty much already have it.
I'm not revolutionizing anyone's world
when I tell them that there's something
that they can put passwords in
and only have to remember one password.
They already have it or they don't want it.
And that's fine.
But here I go on my quest to try to get the world
to use better passwords.
- Yeah, just I have the same sort of thing.
I'm just gonna say that thing with paying for apps though,
it's a bit like the people who will drive around
looking for cheap petrol or gas, Jason.
They'll spend 45 minutes driving around to the cheap one.
then they'll go inside and they'll buy an overpriced chocolate bar and a can of Coke.
And suddenly, well, there goes your savings because you just paid convenience store prices
for your chocolate bar.
You know, it's like what a waste of time that was.
But that's just a... and then, yeah, they're the same sort of people who don't want to
pay a dollar for an app.
That happened all the time in California where there's a big store called Costco, which is
like a, okay, you clearly both know what that is, I would assume it's warehouse of everything.
Yeah, you know, you get you need a 15 gallon thing of mayonnaise, they got you,
you know, 4700 pickles in a jar of it, you got you. But they probably they probably have one
that is so ungodly American, it's ridiculous. How big are your fridges in that country? That's
what I want to know to house these bulk purchased items. I know I think a lot of people have like
extra refrigerator. I don't it's not uncommon I don't think to have like an extra refrigerator
slash freezer like in your garage or something to store all this stuff. But they have gas too.
They have like gas pumps out you know in the front and like a lot of them. There'll be like
30 gas pumps and you can never drive by these places and not just see a line as far as the
the eye can see of people just waiting in line to get gas.
And it's not like it's half price.
You know, if it were $4 at the place you would normally go,
it's like, I don't know, 3.89 or whatever.
Pick a price, it doesn't really matter.
It's not this amount where waiting for 30 minutes
to get gas when you could just go right there
and get it immediately.
I don't know, I never understood that.
I'm sure somebody could tell me why it makes sense,
but yeah, to save 15 cents but spend 30 minutes,
I don't get it.
And to that point, yeah, to save time on something
for 99 cents in an app or whatever, like why not?
I guess that's a super privileged thing for me to say,
I guess, which is totally valid.
But at the same time, I don't know how you can really scoff
at a 99 cent purchase for something
that is arguably improving your life?
Yeah, I don't know.
It's just, it's always that question.
Is this free?
Not even how much does it cost?
The question is never how much does it cost?
The question is specifically, is it free?
Question mark, as if that's the only question there could be.
Like, I don't know, when you go to, you know,
go to work every day, do they go,
are you working for free today?
Like, no, no one says that.
- Yeah, someone's livelihood is attached to it.
So I mean, really the moral of this podcast episode
is pay more for your petrol.
- Yes. - Yes, absolutely.
- Respect the livelihood of those who collected it for you
or developed that app.
I think that's nice.
- Yeah, I think my white whale
in terms of getting people onto apps is OmniFocus
because I love that thing.
- Wow, you just went all the way.
- I love that app so much.
And I feel that anybody could benefit from it.
But you just can't tell people to use it
because it's so--
- You're fighting a religious war there.
That's like, that's some serious business.
- And I'm not even talking about people
that are using things or using a different app.
It's like they're writing on sheets of paper
and they've never been exposed
to this idea of task management.
I'm like, I think, and you know,
it's like, this would be perfect for you,
but how do you start?
So I never do, except with my wife.
I did try and get her on OmniFocus a few years ago now,
and I learned my lesson big time.
She was absolutely overwhelmed with work
and she had so much to do,
and I could see, you know,
she had all these things going,
she couldn't keep them straight, didn't know what to do.
I'm like, that's OmniFocus, that's a project,
that's a project, and then you just flip it
to the other side and you pick your to-dos,
you know, what's available kind of thing.
And I got a setter up I did all the all the husband things I set up the app
I you know sort of talked her through it showed her how it worked and
Then it just sat there unused in the dock
Just never being clicked upon it was it was back when the icon with the little purple fault little purple clip
Oh, yeah
And it just sat there unloved unloved and then I remember clicking on it
You know some time later and it was like omni focus has a software update, you know
Has not been touched
This just isn't gonna work. Is it you kind of have to back into that?
It seems like where you you you can't start with the app. It's like you have to be sold on the principle
To then fall into the app
Yeah, that's such a tough one because it that's another one like one password where I know how much something like that whether it's
Omni focused things
Reminders, whatever has done for me. So of course it fixed my life. So it's gonna fix everyone's life
It's like oh boy
You just brought yourself a world of pain trying to convince someone that their whole life should be in this app like
To me the red flag is when you see someone attaching a physical post-it note to their computer
Sorry if you either of you do that
But I think you know that there are actually numerous tools for the input of text within this device that is sitting in front of you
however, you've decided to
Adhere this little piece of paper
To the side of the screen, please explain and they just go this is how it works for me
Like I'm not gonna touch that and then you get the people that have all the post-it notes
Basically, it's like an entire picture frame of post-it notes around.
Like what is on all these things?
That's right. My to-do list is a bezel around my computer.
It's like a short order cook, you know, just picking up the next ticket.
And I get moved along.
At least for them though, when you have something like OmniFocus, you can put in a
billion tasks and it looks like one, but at least with the monitor thing, they're
limited to like, you know, however big their monitor is.
Unless you start buying new monitors so you can hold more post-its, that's where
There's a really a problem. You're like, oh, you got a new monitor. Yeah, I ran out of post-it room like oh
We need to talk. This is not good. There's a method to their madness. Yeah
What about you man, is this this is kind of like you I feel like you have some some pains on this
This one because this is something that you brought you wanted to bring up. Is there something that you need to confess?
My problem is that I'm too eager to suggest things to people
I don't know if it delves into the area of
Transplaining or not, but I think one of you said maybe was Jason you just have this
Philosophical attachment to why this thing is really really good and it comes down to things like RSS or writing apps and so forth
You know, I see someone using Microsoft Word and I think okay. Well
Clearly you have not explored the world of other note-taking apps or markdown or whatever
Just things that actually work in a way that is distraction free and I'll say I have you considered this if you looked into that
and you just get this look of why would you dare suggest an alternative tool? And you think,
"Oh, I'll give it a go. I'll try to sell them on it." But you just go, "It's not worth it."
And every time I do it, I just think, "Why did I do that?" Just leave them be. They don't need
to be instructed about how to do this thing. So it comes from a good place. And I think a lot
of other nerds would relate to that. You want to help someone or give someone a better tool,
but you know what, maybe they're fine with the mediocrity of something like Microsoft Word and
having a ribbon of 5,000 poorly represented icons that could mean anything. It really is passion,
I think. I think we, I'll speak for everyone, like it's often, it's not misguided, it's just
that somehow we think that it really can,
we're trying to help people,
which sounds a little bit probably over the top,
but at least for me personally,
I feel like whenever I'm doing something like that,
and I do catch myself like, what are you, just shut up.
Like, just stop.
They don't care.
All you're doing is confusing people
and being annoying to them.
And on from my side, I'm like, oh man,
this person's gonna, their life is gonna be so changed.
They're just gonna they're gonna go home. They're gonna say guess what I learned today
Somebody told me about this thing and my life is so much better like no, that's not gonna happen
It's just not it's not but we try, you know, we try it's it's one of the few things
That us nerds try to do to be really helpful to people. It's just maybe not what they other people need
Yeah, and I think we sort of become evangelists of something because maybe we've heard it from a friend or it's been that word-of-mouth
Or maybe we've read it on a tech blog or site
But we've identified a problem that has to be fixed and then we go and explore it ourselves
Apply it work out the way that works for us and then bang we found our solution. Whereas the unwitting
victim of the recommendations of the suggestion never explored that problem. It wasn't an issue
for them. You've come along and just said, "Yeah, have I got a solution for you?" So you're sort of
an unwelcome salesperson in a way. So I'm always trying to think, "How can I be more self-aware
in that sense and not be that annoying guy?" Even if it comes from a good place.
The computer fan guy at the computer store. That's who we actually are. I just realized
that's terrible. No, say it ain't so.
So is that I think just about wrap us up for today. Is there anything else you two wanted to talk about?
I guess we should go over our sponsors which are Casper, Squarespace and Linode. I want to thank
them. It's not Linode is it? Oh shoot is it? I gotta read the copy. Oh damn it no I think you're
right it's Linode. What we do need to promote though, forget the sponsors, we need to promote
our own site and we have gone all out, well Jason went all out, and we have got a website,
We got inline players you can get you want to listen to this podcast you can do it hemispheric views.com

Are there any other random weird, I say weird, that's not the correct term.
other like Vegemite-y type things that I can buy?
So yeah, on top of the Vegemite thing, Jason, you've got the Tim Tam Slam.
Now to explain the Tim Tam, it's an Arnott's biscuit.
Arnott's is the brand and they're not plugging, I'm not plugging, they're not sponsoring the
show although they are known for having no substitute for quality.
Okay, so I came across that accidentally.
I forget what I was looking for.
And that, it's like a cookie that you do something with tea or something and you like slam it
in your face.
What you do, you take the Tim Tam, you nibble the end off and then you turn the biscuit
and you nibble the other end off and what you suddenly have is a biscuit with no ends
and in the middle is this sort of icing material, right?
And what you want to do, yeah, it's like a chocolate thing.
And what you do is you put your mouth on one end of the Tim Tam that's been bitten off,
and you dip the other end into your hot chocolate or coffee and you slurp the hot beverage through
the middle of the biscuit and then shove it in your mouth as quickly as possible and the
whole thing melts and explodes in this fit of chocolate pleasure.
And that's a Tim Tam slam.
And that's what you need to do.
Cookie in Australia.
When you say cookie, there's a very classic image of the sort of American choc chip cookie.
Everything else is a biscuit.
Is that fair, Andrew?
I'm loving Choc-Chip. That's my new favorite thing.
Choc-Chip.
That's what I'm calling it now.
Not chocolate chip.
It's like, I don't have time for that.
Choc-Chip.
- Really?
- I love it.
- Now he says chocolate chip.
No, it's Choc-Chip.
(laughing)
- That's so good. I love it.
Choc-Chip. That's my new one.
Got it.
Gotta write that down.
(upbeat music)
