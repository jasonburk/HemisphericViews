I'm giving up a lot today to be talking to you too. Oh because today is the last two games of the NBL
season
And both games are pivotal
To who makes the playoffs and who doesn't?
including the hometown Perth Wildcats
hmm, so I will be I'm missing one game as we speak and
I will definitely be off this call prior to the Perth Wildcats game
[Music]
Well I don't know what you two think but for people who are getting thirsty on a basketball court
I reckon this stuff would be pretty good right?
Kool-Aid? Are you drinking the Kool-Aid Martin?
Well, no, we actually discovered this recently.
Sponsor?
No, not a sponsor.
Oh, okay.
Just checking.
The birds are loud outside.
I apologize to everyone.
They're a rock or something, but without hitting them, that would be irresponsible.
We discovered a snack place nearby in Port Kembla.
Or is it Warawong?
I'm not sure where the border is.
But is this something that you drink often, Jason, as an American?
Because we always hear that you're all drinking the Kool-Aid.
Never.
No.
that since I was probably, wow, 10 years old or something? It's been a very long time.
Well, that would be great for me, given that I do that whole cordial mix thing,
you know, those sugar-free alternatives that you always make fun of me for drinking.
Yes.
I'm looking at that, Martin, and I'm thinking that that looks anything but sugar-free.
Oh, no, that's pure sugar.
So, Kool-Aid is different to cordial, isn't it?
Oh yeah. Yeah, but Kool-Aid has zero benefit to the human body. There's no reason that should go
inside of a human. But it says here, this little Kool-Aid man, and he's in the shape of a jug with
a smiley face. It's caffeine free, so that's good. The only thing Kool-Aid is good for is if you need
a wall taken down quick, then you call in the Kool-Aid man, he busts through the door, through
the wall, wall's gone, handled. Question though, flavors. What flavors are they? Are they
local to Australia flavors or are they just something boring like cherry?
Well, the one that I'm holding in my hand right now is pineapple, but at the top it says "pina-pineapple"
so I'm not sure if they're just catering to different languages or markets are actually
claiming that it's called "pina-pineapple" whatever. And the other one is probably your favorite,
Orange.
Orange.
But interestingly, and I find this funny, the Kool-Aid man with whom I'm not as familiar as you obviously are, Jason, does not seem to change color according to the flavor.
He remains red.
He's also spilling some of himself outside of his own jug abdomen.
Always. He is a filthy mess.
That is excellent, man.
Good find.
I would like to just trial something.
I'm going to now say that famous phrase and then we're going to get Jason to say it and
it's going to we're going to see who sounds more authentic and authoritative. Okay, so here we go.
Which phrase is this? Oh, you go first.
Martin, you've been drinking the Kool-Aid.
Okay, Jason.
Can you elaborate on this famous phrase?
This quoted famous phrase?
What I just said.
You've been drinking the Kool-Aid.
You've been drinking the Kool-Aid.
Which one which one sounds which one sounds better man which is more authentic.
More authentic.
What do you mean by authentic in this case if it was a cool man it would be oh yeah.
That would be more authentic to the closing I just think somebody with an Australian accent saying you been drinking the Kool-Aid mate.
It's not like that I reckon you okay now that I get what you're going I get where you're going with this Jason probably sounds more authentic as the American but in terms of appearing in an ad or a bit of a corporate.
Presentation spin I think you take the authenticity cake Andrew different markets different audiences.
You both went in your own spheres to be diplomatic.
If we were building out a year over year growth chart of the Kool-Aid brand,
then obviously you would be king. I mean, there'd be no question.
Yeah, like earlier, Andrew said the word pivotal when he was almost like accidentally going to say
pivot table. Yeah. And then he pivoted to say pivotal.
Yeah. This is the pivot table game between Perth and the other one.
Martin, are you young, old enough, I should say, to remember the Coddy's Cordial song?
Yeah, of course.
To make the cordial that I like best.
Yeah.
My dad makes the fruit.
Goes to Coddy's.
But did you sing the alternative version that everyone at primary school would sing?
Oh, yeah, I did.
Well, you have to remind me.
Like, my dad picks his bum, that whole thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
Which is not really sanitary.
I wouldn't suggest that. You guys.
Manufacturing any food product.
Classic you guys.
Jason will find the YouTube and it's classic Australian TV.
Yeah.
There's so many good ones.
There's like the Vegemite song, you know, Rose in Every Cheek.
You've got Meadow Lee, you know, ought to be congratulated.
You've got to appreciate your mum, everyone.
That is if she is fulfilling the role as, you know, margarine or butter spreader.
Dad's can too, right?
Got to be modern.
Good on you, mum.
Yeah, I've come across a lot of classic commercials when I've been hunting for the old
Commercials that I play before we do the live things
Yes, so I have quite a few old commercials that I've seen just
Looking for the gems and now I've got a couple more to add
This is such an incredible show
And this is what people tune in for some people do more than tune in
Some people pay money what who would do that they do that because they want to be members of one prime plus calm one prime plus calm.
So much money is coming we actually could pay for that sound bite so.
And I believe we have a new one prime plus member and you.
Placian
Hemisphere Ian if you will
Yeah, should I can I give the shout out?
Shout it from the rooftops
in
coming oh
we have
stepping into the ring
not to be messed with
weighing in a
224 pounds six foot five
Peter
I think asking them on the form now for people actually put in their weight and height are
you sharing private data?
I'm making numbers up I don't even know what 224 pounds is.
It's like 7 kilos?
Four stones.
I don't know.
Not a clue.
Peter W thank you for your support of OnePrimePlus.com.
Actually just looked it up at 224 pounds in stone is 15.9 stone apparently so.
Okay and let me just do 224 pounds is 101 kilograms so Peter W actually lighter than me at this stage.
There we go.
I'm just slightly off my playing weight at the moment so.
Well it's all right you got two games to get there so.
Andrew's BMI will be in the show notes.
I'm trending towards morbidly obese.
We'll give you the login to his smart scale so you can keep track of him.
Thank you, Peter W. for being part of One Prime Plus.
And I mentioned Live Watch earlier.
This show actually goes out two or three days before the next Live Watch, actually, which
is February 11th, US Pacific time, and then figure out the rest from there.
It's in our Discord, which if you are or are not 1Prime+, Discord it up.
But yeah, LiveWatch coming up, and all the details are in Supercast.
So look at the Supercast feeds if you are a 1Prime+ member, and it's all in there.
So thank you, Peter W., and everyone else.
Now I'm seeing a robot about source code.
You're the robot Jason.
Yeah, I mean we usually like to dive in.
Did you say tomato sauce?
I wish, yeah.
Manual dispensing is so yesterday.
Sauce code, yeah.
Today we're talking sauce code.
I like that you actually pronounce the two differently.
That's one of those Australian words where it's like.
The same.
Yep, straight from the source.
What?
As in the source code?
the source. The source is from the source. Oh, give up. Anyway.
So today I just wanted to bring up one quick thing. This happened a couple weeks ago, but
we didn't actually have a chance to talk about it. The source code or sauce code, as you all say,
for the Apple release was released 40 years, I think, ago, something like that is when that
that was happening.
So that's quite a while ago, but I just, I found two bits interesting with this
and I don't think we need to really dive in too much, but the first one was
somebody did an analysis of the code for how many times that the F word was in
there.
I thought that was fun.
It was something like a dozen different times and each one of them was gold.
So, uh, I will link that in the show notes so you can go look at it, but I
I just thought that was great because they were very, you know,
passionate when they were writing their comments in their code.
Is that in the comments or is that an actual?
In the comments. Yeah. Okay. It's not, there's not.
No, I don't think there's a call.
They actually found the week later that it was an acronym for frequently,
frequently underused critical kernel. So it was all just a.
Damn it. Took the fun out of that one. Thanks for that, Martin. Geez.
You took the fun out of it.
You didn't take the far out of it.
Sorry, dad joke.
Australian coming in strong today.
Uh, the second thing was I downloaded it obviously, cause I'm going to do nothing
with it, but everyone should have a copy of the Lisa source code just in case.
Um, and it unzipped to a whopping 27 megabytes, which is wild because then I
I thought, what is a, what's a, like just a,
you know, you're taking a picture with your phone,
you get a blurry crap one you're gonna go delete,
like what does that take up in space?
So I went and looked,
and I took a crappy photo on purpose that was blurry,
and it was 64.3 megabytes for one photo on my phone.
- Really?
- Which is just insane that in 40 years,
you go from like everything in the system, being 27,
to a crap throwaway photo being 64 megabytes.
It's just nuts.
- May I just ask though, sorry to get all specific
on your, or picky on that megabyte number for the photo.
What photo settings are you using?
- Raw photo. - Raw, okay.
- Raw photo, iPhone 14 Pro.
- Yeah, you gotta get some heat going on that.
- Yes, that, well, yeah, if I did the compressed
and all that crap, yeah, it would be like a couple,
but just with what ease I can create 65 megabytes of garbage.
It's just fun.
And yeah, so there you go, Apple Lisa source code.
I have no use for it, but it's cool that it's available
and I bet someone is gonna do something with it.
- Yeah, can you run it in an emulator
or is it just not possible?
- I have no idea.
I am sure there are people far more intelligent
in that area than me that are probably already creating
like kits so you can run your own Lisa at home
on a Raspberry Pi or something.
I have to imagine.
So I don't know.
Now I will go find out and I will link them if they do.
- Now I'm seeing another robot.
There's another robot, Jason.
You're up next.
- I'm scared of this robot.
- Well, this one was actually a joke.
I wasn't actually gonna do this.
This was more to strike fear into both of you.
The title for everyone's listening
is comprehensive 12 level deep dive on Obsidian.
I don't think anybody's really talking about
this application from what I've seen on the internet.
I've heard basically nothing.
I don't understand why no one's talking.
- I thought you were talking about geology.
I was confused.
- Yeah.
(laughs)
Today on Geology Corner,
I'm gonna talk about my favorite blocks.
- Well, 12 levels, you're talking about Strata,
it's, you know, into the earth.
- No, it's true.
And they're different at each level.
It's very true.
No, I am not going to give a comprehensive 12 level deep dive on obsidian today.
Wink wink.
That could happen in the future.
Um, but no, that was a joke, but I did see that Andrew played into my joke and put a
sub bullet underneath my, my comment.
So I am curious, uh, as to what this basketball underneath is, is relating to.
And if there's anything I can do to help.
Yes.
Well, the great irony on this, my sub bullet says, do I need to get up, give up on log
The great irony of this is that Jason for so long has been asking me and Martin,
"Gentlemen, have you heard the good word? Have you heard the good word about Obsidian?"
And it's always been a joke because he's always laughed at the cult of Obsidian.
"Oh yeah, absolutely, look at all these losers getting so into it. It's a plain text editor that can do markdown.
Markdown and ugly in it.
And so why would anybody use this piece of junk?
Have you heard the good word about obsidian?
That was such a good impression by the way.
That was like spot on.
I am sure you've gotten similar messages from Jason over the time.
Yes.
Pause.
Yes.
And I, and I derided it and thought, what an idiot.
And went on my merry way of using log seek.
As you should.
Cause it's an outliner.
And then all of a sudden Jason sends me another message.
Have you heard the good word about obsidian?
No, no, no.
Really?
Have you?
I'm like, what?
I know the good word.
No, no.
The good word.
Like I am using obsidian and I am now telling you the good word.
You need to understand the good word.
Suddenly he went from being a gentle door knocker just handing me a leaflet of information,
seeing if I was interested in the good word, to literally dragging me out the door,
taking me to the synagogue, putting me down, putting handcuffs around my wrists,
so that I could hear the good word about the vicinity.
Just to interject, we're not claiming that any people of Jewish descent or belief do actually use
tools such as handcuffs to indoctrinate or convert people.
No, no, I was not thinking, I was thinking more Scientology probably, if you're gonna ask me of anything.
Do they have synagogues? Is that anywhere?
Oh, I don't know.
Place of worship in general.
I think they have places, they jump on couches.
So, Jason's love of Obsidian has gone from a joke to a real thing.
And the level of about face that he is gone through has made me question whether my love for log sick is misplaced and that perhaps I too should be.
Embracing the good word of obsidian what do I do guys I tried obsidian before I didn't like it.
But now Jason's talking about so much and he's such an enabler.
It's true it is one of my best qualities.
This is like when someone gets cool new shoes at school and you want their shoes is that it.
Yes.
Something like that.
These shoes have plugins.
What is it like Crocs with gibbets?
Is that what you're talking about?
Yeah, you can put little like charms on them and little stones from yeah.
Yeah, so it's like Pandora for your feet.
Are you actually using Logsack?
So I ran out of things to put in it.
I realise I don't create a lot of content.
I think you're done then. I think you just...
That's it. You've run out of things to create in your life that I think you're just done.
You don't need any tool.
That's a bit morbid.
You're done Andrew. Just give up. Just roll over. Don't even worry.
I decided to create an Obsidian database and look, this is not going to be a 12-step guide to Obsidian,
But it's going to be my two-step guide to my obsidian vault.
If you're so interested.
I'm dying.
Bursting.
Bring it on.
Okay.
All right.
So I got a, let me just click through here.
Yes.
On the 28th of the 1st on 2023 in my daily note.
Yes.
I have two notes.
Okay.
I ordered a replacement Lego space helmet visor for Benjamin.
Good.
That's a good thing.
You want to note that down.
That's good.
It came in the packet and the little pin area where it clips onto the helmet, the visor wouldn't clip on.
It was broken, misformed.
But Lego, top quality customer service.
You just ask for the new bit and they send it.
No questions asked.
Where would you have logged that if you didn't have your Obsidian vault?
That's my question.
The point.
I'm probably I'm going to regret asking this question, but why are you logging that?
Because I might forget.
But haven't you sent an email or some correspondence, which is the record that they will respond to?
Martin, I think I think I think you're missing the point here.
You're missing the point.
OK, this is a vault.
OK, this is his vault and this is his daily note about his Lego space helmet.
That's the thing you're missing, I think.
So clearly now that you've got that, continue on, please.
With that, otherwise point number two.
So now I have my second bullet of two bullets.
Bullet point two. Yeah. The same note though? This is the same note.
Same note. It's a busy day.
Busy day. Two bullet points this day. Okay. And by the way, it can handle that much information.
I just want to let you know, like the vault is pretty sturdy. So two bullet points, no problem.
We're good. Okay. It's good to know. So this bullet point says Jason Burke. Jason Burke
has double brackets around it. So it's a Wikilink.
Oh, wow.
Right.
Jason Burke advises me that obsidian is the good word. Wow. So you're, you are being kind of
self-referential about the thing of which you're writing in right now. Yes. And so I click this is
the pat. Now I'm going to get to the power of obsidian. Is this the power, is this a power
user moment right here? Are you going to level this up? As I mentioned, Jason Burke is a clickable
link. He is. Yes. I'm going to click it. Click me. Bam! It's taken me to another note. That
note is called Jason Burke. Oh. It has one line in it and it says "My Apple Enabler".
Ah! It's all coming together. So now if you ever forget, you have a way to get back to
that point. Who is Jason Burke? I don't know. I forget who he is. I search him up. Better
that link. Yeah, that's great. Okay, I can go right back to it. Push the back arrow. I'm back at
back at the Daily Note. If you need more of a sales pitch than that, I don't know
even what's going on. So I think you're on your way. Honestly, I think you're ready to go.
I think you're ready to get rid of Logsac and move on. So Martin,
have you heard? Have you heard the good word?
I've heard it and that's it.
This is not really a marketing tool.
I'm just going to go ahead and throw that out there right now.
I think the two layers that we've gone on this is good for now.
We'll come back to the remaining 10 at a later date.
Okay, people can't wait.
I do appreciate you taking this in like a stepped approach where we'll do the two levels now
and then we'll come back.
We don't want to overwhelm.
We want to be considerate of people's time so we'll end there but thank you for that.
Illuminating walkthrough.
So I'm just a little bit confused are you moving have you moved what the hell's going on.
I'm concurrently rainbows.
You the fence is what he's saying now I have no idea where I put anything once again I'm back to my original problem.
As long as you're linking both of them to each other somehow so that you know two months down the track when you do decide it's very hard to dismantle all of the knowledge management connections that you've built.
Yeah that would make for a great episode.
Of course I've still got I'm still keeping all the source files in Devon think and then referring to meeting notes in agenda.
Oh God.
So, there's all that still to unravel.
Is this a joke or is this true?
No, that's legit.
That's 100% true.
It has to be.
No one would joke about that.
Also, Jason's confused because you're talking about source files
and he's thinking you're keeping knowledge like management files about, you know,
With the pasta?
What is this?
This is like a pasta thing?
I'm so confused.
Ketchup.
Well, you got to distinguish your master foods, your fountain,
different Heinz options.
It's very difficult.
At least you just continue using the same calendar forever.
At least there's like some stability in the world of calendars.
Nice segue to the next basketball.
That is really what's important here is like you may not ever know where your knowledge is, but you always know what's coming up on the next day because your calendar is always the same. Am I right?
You're sort of right. You're not really right. You're kind of wrong.
Damn it.
Thankfully due to the Apple calendar system where they can all cross talk with one another
based off a central database, yes my calendar data is still safe.
But the interface in which I access that data is changing.
Because Fantastical put their prices up some time ago.
I'm not renewing.
It's too expensive for us Australians now Martin.
Didn't subscribe, didn't know, but sure.
It's been great.
It's always been a little bit annoying and I've never really used it to its full capacity.
And I tried for a while to use its bookings.
It has a system where other people can book a meeting in your time.
And it was a bit iffy.
I think all those meeting booking systems are a bit iffy though, to be perfectly honest.
Just the nature of the lovely iCal, ICS system or whatever it uses, CalDAV.
although it's just gotten too expensive.
So I'm needing to find a new option.
- Okay.
- And the new option is the old option,
which is the app I used to use an eon ago.
- Right.
- I've gone to BusyCal.
- Okay.
- Which is part of the set up subscription
that I already am paying for.
So that's good.
- Okay.
- But that's not enough.
- Have you already moved there
or is this being run at the same time?
- Same time.
Oh, guaranteed same time.
- As Fantastical like your note thing.
- Yeah, well, Fantastical hasn't actually expired yet.
I've still got like another month.
- No, he's gonna run it.
He's gonna run it.
- Until it expires.
- Hates it, doesn't like it, doesn't wanna use it,
but will keep using it until the very end
because he's gotta use up that last $1.52 worth
of subscription.
- That's exactly right.
So that's my Mac solution there, busy cow.
- Yeah, well it's on the iOS as well, right?
So you're good there.
- Yeah, it's not great though on the iOS.
So I'm trying something a little different with iOS.
I've been trying time page, uh, which is the model of the skin there.
Oh, right. Yeah. Okay.
Apparently I'm grandfathered into some plans.
I don't have to buy the in app.
I must've bought it many, many years ago and I'm still grandfathered in.
It's, it's quite cute, but it's not as immediately accessible as fantastical.
So that's a bit of a challenge.
So you're saying cute is not your like number one bullet point you want from a
calendar app. That's not, I don't, I don't know.
So where I think I'm going to land is for iOS is Apple Calendar,
Calendar 366.
Calendar 366. That's the name of it?
Yeah. I highly recommend it. It has all the same, it has calendar sets,
which is kind of one of the great features of Fantastical.
It has a display very similar to it.
So I think Calendar 366 is going to be the iOS solution for
me and for my bookings, I want to thank listener to the show, Joshua, who
recommended cal.com.
If you need bookings or you need somebody to schedule meetings with you outside your
organization, cal.com is a free option.
Most of these places charge like $200 a year for other people to make bookings with
you. Cal.com does it and it supports Cal Dev and fast mail.
Okay.
So for all you people who are annoyed with Fantastical,
here's the solution.
Follow my referral code to subscribe to said app.
Here it is. Here's the old bait and switch. Okay.
It's just three easy steps. Give me money, give me money, give me money.
And I don't care what happens to you.
Now because you've got a new subscription,
you're going to need to track your money a little more carefully.
So follow my subscription referral link to 1ab to
help you manage your money better.
Can we just cut to the chase here real quick?
Can you just give them, you have like a link that goes to all this crap, so let's just
give them that, they can sign up for all the shit that you're hawking and it'll be good
for everybody, is that fair?
Yeah, let me just double check that URL, I believe it is Kenyon.blog/save.
Save there you go.
You could save.
Doesn't sound spammy at all.
So much.
And it takes you to a page beautiful look at it I'm looking at now.
I'm not really at links now I would never remember and it has a reminder at the top if you don't pay for a service then you are the product.
Right and how much was cal.com again.
Oh yeah, that was...
Oh, okay, she's checking.
I had to ask.
I love it when we unwind all of Andrew's schemes. It's great.
Very good.
All right. So if you're looking for a convoluted calendar solution,
Or sweet solution, you might call it. That is right there for you. So, thank you.
I ask questions that I sometimes regret, right? But I'm going to ask it.
I'm still learning.
What is wrong with using, just to be specific here, calendar.app? What is wrong with doing that?
There's no answer. It's so default.
That is not an answer.
It's got friction points.
You know what's the default? Wearing underwear. Do you wear underwear?
Daily.
All right, there you go. So you're really basic, Andrew.
To be fair, though, that also has friction points sometimes, so...
What, calendar or underwear?
Underwear, but we can go back to calendar. Yeah.
Yeah, nobody likes a thigh chafe. That calendar, it's okay, but you get annoyed,
like it doesn't have the calendar sets. If you're managing multiple calendars, it's a little
annoying I don't like the display the presentation it just looks a little ugly
not enough density. It looks like a calendar. It's not enough density. You heard it here first.
Especially on iOS like the Mac version is a little better I think. You're right I
regret asking this. Martin calendar on Mac used to be good and then they got rid of
the leather and the stitching. Yeah that little torn edge. Yeah it's just never been the same since.
Yeah, it makes sense.
Skeuomorphism for the win.
So just checking real quick, Martin,
was there any more questions about calendar?
You didn't want to ask any more questions, right?
No, that is absolutely fine.
OK, good.
Thank you.
Did I mention what my calendar is being backed?
I said fast mail, didn't I?
And I said that I have a referral code to fast mail.
You said that three or four times.
Yeah, we got--
Yeah.
Yeah.
OK, so you will both now see that I'm putting strike
through the calendar point.
Okay, good.
Which means it has been completed.
Oh, I didn't even mention.
No, I didn't even mention that.
Wonderful.
That's great.
Quick recap, quick recap.
Everything from a note perspective, rock solid for you.
That's good to hear.
Everything from a calendar perspective, rock solid.
Happy to hear that.
So really all that's left, I guess, is what podcast you're listening to, which is surely
not changed in a long time as well.
Is that fair to say?
So we can just move right past -- It's fair to say, but I still need to back
up and I forgot to mention a critical app structured dot app structured get
structured iOS Mac OS is that plan your day.
I don't know.
We don't know.
That's your job.
I'll find that.
You figure it out.
Yeah.
It's really cool.
It helps you plan your day.
You can move tasks around and assign a window of time for them.
So if you needed to say like, okay, replace Lego space man helmet and like eat
Breakfast and then all of a sudden it's like oh shoot. I need to move those around
That allows you to easily do that. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, exactly. It's really fun. It's just like time block time blocking your day
Nice
Really like it, you know, even after this whole discussion. I have no idea what you're doing. Yeah. Well, that's okay
I got the R. All that's all I wanted
That was that was a pure fishing expedition, he's just like yeah
No, I understand. I just wanted to annoy you
Okay, so we're good on calendars good on notes good on podcast. There's nothing to say about podcast listening that I can see oh
Wait, no, there is another there's another basketball. What I feel like this is a basketball heavy show today
It's pretty dominating the microphone heavy. Yeah. Yeah, it's well, this is actually not really it's not really a massive topic for me
Okay
I just want to say recently and I want to ask you guys recently
I found that I've not been of the mind to listen to podcasts and my cue is...
Saying that on, while recording a podcast meant for other people to listen to, you're
saying people should not listen to podcasts? Is that...
No, they should always listen to our podcast.
Oh, okay. Okay.
But my, yeah, I'm just saying, all these podcasts that I have always been a
pretty loyal listener to, I've suddenly just don't have the motivation.
And I actually think this was put into my brain by my Apple enabler, Jason Burke.
Oh no, is this linked via the wiki?
Well, I haven't yet, but I will.
Okay.
I believe, Jason, you have some explaining to do, because you've put this in my mind.
I'm now not listening to the same podcasts that I always have, and it's your fault. Explain.
It's my fault? Oh, okay.
Yep, I'll take the blame for that. Certainly. I think what you're referring to is the fact that
I deleted all of my podcasts is probably what you were referring to. Is that right?
Yeah. Yeah. If you can do it. Well, I can't delete. I'm not that level.
You can do it. So can I.
Because you're my Apple enabler.
I am. Yeah. The Apple enabler that apparently enables things outside the Apple sphere,
which is interesting. So maybe I should just be enabler. Maybe it would be a more appropriate
title for me, but it's a wiki and it's Markdown so you can change it. Right. So
yeah, I'll take the blame. I suppose I just recently got rid of just a lot. I had so many
podcasts in my, I don't know what do you even call it? Feed, a subscription list,
whatever the heck you call it, you know, pod catcher. Yeah. Whatever you, wherever you get
- Get your podcasts. - Get your.
(laughing)
- Oh, wherever you listen to your podcasts, I love that.
Did I tell you guys recently,
I heard one that was something like,
listen to us on, and it was like some super obscure thing,
and then it was like, or wherever you get your podcasts.
I'm like, what are you getting?
No one's heard of this crap,
and then you're just gonna bundle all the real ones
into this wherever you listen?
Okay, sounds good.
Anyway, changing the subject.
No, I just, I had so much stuff in my life.
Every single day I was overwhelmed.
There was too much.
I was never caught up.
So why not just remove some stuff?
And so I started hacking out a bunch of just content,
whether it was podcasts, YouTube subscriptions, RSS feeds.
I kind of just went through everything with a machete
and just started cutting stuff out
to get back to a point where my goal was
to leave myself wanting for more.
And what I mean by that was that at the end of every day,
week, whatever measurement,
I wanted to be in the position where I was,
call it bored, or whatever that feeling is,
where you're just sort of like, oh,
normally I just sort of have something always going,
or there's 50,000 RSS I haven't looked at,
or there's YouTube stuff piled up, or podcasts.
I wanted to get to the point every so often
where I was just like, I don't have any stuff,
which would then make me hopefully go look
for something new to sort of cycle stuff out.
'Cause I think it's fair,
and I know we're talking about this on a show
that could be in this bucket of getting cycled out,
and honestly, I'm okay with that.
I don't think everything needs to be forever.
Some podcasts have been around for 15 years now.
If you had stopped listening at some point
and came back later, I don't see that to be an issue.
You shouldn't have to do something forever,
especially if now it's just become habitual,
where it's like I listen to X
because I've always listened to X,
so why would I not listen to X?
What are they talking about today?
Literally nothing I care about,
but I'm gonna listen to it anyway.
Like that becomes a thing for me anyway.
I don't wanna speak too broadly here,
but that was sort of what got me rolling on this,
to where I started with podcasts
and then I went through YouTube, RSS was the same.
So that now it was like, I get through RSS real quick.
And then it's sort of left with like, Oh, I'll go do something else now, I guess.
So that's in a rambly kind of way, how this all happened to me.
And I think I brought that up to you a week or two ago.
I forget.
Yeah.
About that.
I was talking to you about something and that sort of just came out of my mind.
So yeah, that's.
And I think it resonated with me.
And so now I want to know what Martin thinks of all this, given that he is the resident podcast
PhD expert.
Yeah, that is actually a really good point.
Oh, that's kind.
So the question is how I feel about cutting things down or having lots or whatever.
Yeah, yeah. And like is is the concept of perhaps having a holiday for a podcast listening,
a healthy thing, a good thing, an interesting thing.
I feel like I'm going to answer in a way that gets another eye roll from you, Andrew.
Let me stretch my eyeballs. I'm ready.
So I have a lot of podcast subscriptions in Overcast.
Sometimes I don't get to all of them. And then I don't worry about it.
That's that is a personality thing. That's 100% a personality trait. That's what that is.
So I'd like to listen to, let's say, Podcast X every week. Sometimes I don't have time.
And then the next one comes out and I go okay
And you just swipe to delete do
No, I just leave it there Martin can have an email badge that says 50,000 and not care
That's the difference
So I gotta get to inbox zero. I've got to empty it out. I
Like that I agree with both of you. I'm not saying who does it matter and ideally I'd like not to have you know
craft building up
voice. That's Martin doing the impression of us doing the Martin voice. That's what that is.
I'm very confused. What did I do?
This is the inception.
You needed to like, "Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh."
Yeah, inbox zero is good, but you just don't care.
Whatever.
Well, you know what? One day, sorry if this is morbid, one day you're going to be dead
and the emails won't stop. They'll keep piling up because they won't know you're dead.
Wait, are you saying that? Oh, wow. That's terrible.
So, inbox zero is something you shouldn't worry about. It's just like when there was a neighbor
who, you know, this is a few years ago, who died and mail kept coming into their mailbox.
So, you eventually tell them, "That's it," and you move on. So, what I'm saying is there's a grand,
Biggest scheme to the world where I don't think you need to worry about how many podcast subscriptions are in your app
By the way, barton talking about emails building up in your inbox like that
Do you know something that saves me day in day out?
from that idea
Is sane box?
Same box keeps my inbox fresh and clean do it
And uh, if you'd like to try the magic of sandbox you can get a trial
And if you want to find if you want to save some money just go to canyon.blog/save and click the referral link for same box.
The worst pitch man ever it's just he every every night he goes out to the bar with his friends and they're just like God how is he going to try to work in one of his saving coupon codes today.
Exactly that was a really nice sandwich well let me tell you the ingredients to make that sandwich could be on your doorstep in 30 minutes.
Do you want my HelloFresh code?
Yeah, I knew it. I was going to say HelloFresh but I thought I'm not going to put a brand in there and you said it for me. My God.
There it is.
No, but honestly, with the podcast thing, I'm not really bothered, to be honest, if things build up.
But with, as you were kind of looking for the researchy vibe on this, I suppose, I think it is interesting thinking about fan communities or the sort of stuff that we generally listen to.
there is a pressure to keep up with the latest of what multiple different people are saying.
And then you kind of end up hearing the same thing across lots of different podcasts,
which we probably do sometimes, but we kind of meander into a lot of BS at the same time.
So we're not quite the same. I don't know. I hope so. Yeah, I don't I don't think it's a problem.
Like, there are like major podcasters out there who do these tech shows, and they're probably not
super worried if you don't listen to every single episode. Even if you're like a paying member or
or something, it's like, you know what, enjoy what you can.
We know there are others out there.
Obviously they're competing with each other,
but I don't think producers or listeners need to worry.
Just listen and enjoy and move on.
So I think what Jason said is actually quite
a healthy perspective to kind of go, you know what,
I've reached the end of the queue,
move on, do something else.
- Can I tell you the most- - That's what I'd say.
- The most impactful part of this whole thing for me
is being surprised again.
something will happen that was like two weeks ago,
and I'll go, oh, that's cool.
I had no idea XYZ happened,
'cause I didn't hear about the rumor about it,
and then like the other rumor, and then the rumor changed,
and then here's the release date,
and like here's all the specs, and then it came out,
and it was like, I don't care.
I've heard every goddamn thing about it to this point.
Now it's like something happens,
I'm like, oh, that's delightful.
That is one massive benefit that I found
in the last like couple of weeks,
and it's been very nice, so.
- You know what this has reminded me of?
Sorry to derail for a second here,
but listeners would remember the PlaySchool windows, right?
- Oh, obviously. - How could they forget?
- That's right.
Now, I don't know if you two are aware
that there's a show that I'm not sure
if it's actually on Apple TV+ yet,
but it is coming if it isn't already, called "Shape Island."
- No. - No.
- No, I wouldn't know.
I won't find out until two weeks after it comes out,
and I'm gonna love that. - Well, there you go.
Well, I'm warning you now,
And it reminded me of that episode that we did and this very, you know, kind of discussion that we just had now about who cares about what and who's picky or fussy or chaotic or whatever shape island.
There are three characters.
Shut up.
Square.
There's a circle.
And although it isn't a notch, there's a triangle.
Wait, is it related?
Kind of line up.
Pardon?
Is it related to the actual thing or is this just like a total rip off?
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
It's a separate thing.
It has nothing to do with play school or any of that.
It's not really a ripoff of Windows, but there's a square, a circle and a triangle
Roughly lining up for those kind of characters we were talking about
so I would be interested to see how much it kind of echoes the
Personality traits and quirks of this very podcast. Sounds like we have our next live watch then
I guess we're gonna have to go through all those. But I laughed because when I watched the trailer
Square liked things just so
*laughter*
I love Square, good on you. You don't say
It sounds like we got a copyright strike somebody was listening to my show and has ripped it off.
We are pretty big brand and that's why we have a CD in tell us more.
Yeah big news.
I changed everything behind the scenes and no one knows or cares about any of it which was the intended consequence we now have a proper.
Content delivery network for hemisphere fuse.
Thank you let me guess we have a server in the northern hemisphere ever so that in the southern hemisphere.
We have like 15 or 20 servers all over the globe we are like we're not messing around here let me tell you this is serious business.
- You might have to define what CDN is on the podcast here
'cause I was thinking, initialisms and acronyms,
they may not be clear to everyone.
So I actually did that little force press on the trackpad
to see what came up.
And the first thing that came up in the Apple dictionary
was CDN, abbreviation, Canada
for International Vehicle Registration.
So are we registered in Canada now?
- We are actually, yeah.
We do have stuff coming out of Canada.
We have many-- - Hey Scotty.
- We have many loyal listeners in Canada as well.
- Yeah, so it's a delivery network of caching servers
so that wherever you are in the world,
things will be closer to you and faster.
- Awesome.
- So if I wanted to try this system out right now,
what would I do?
How would I experience the speed?
Is there a website I can check out?
- I think if you went and looked at any of the show notes,
actually, where there are linked images,
those should be lightning quick now.
- Okay, listen.hemistratereviews.
Mm-hmm
Dot-com it's where you find all the best show notes. Mm-hmm. Just trying it out here. Let's see
Canyon dot blog slash save via the CNN as well. So
This is fast
You're telling me
Whoa, okay seems to be working
We try another one
Well, that's loaded before I could scroll to the image couldn't even get to it. It's already goodness. That is how fast that is
is. And so what platform are we using for said CVN? We are using bunny.net. Okay, bunny.net.
Bunny.net. Not a sponsor, but I would gladly accept them as one because they are fantastic.
Do they have a referral code?
Anyway, when I hear bunny and net together, it actually reminds me of that old Telstra ad,
Andrew. Do you remember what I'm talking about? No, I don't think so. Not yet.
The kid in the back seat. So, the dad's driving his car to or from school and they're talking about,
you know, why they- - he says, why they build a great wall of China, dad? And the dad doesn't
know the answer. And he's like, oh, that was in the time of Emperor Nazi Goring. It was to keep
the rabbits out. What did he reference for that? Did he just look down into nothing and then come
up with it? He's just driving and there's just this kind of awkward pause where he's like,
I don't know, but he doesn't want to appear dumb or ignorant to his son, so he just makes it up and
the son's kind of like, "Hmm, okay." And he kind of goes down to keep writing on his little booklet.
Okay, got it. Because clearly there wasn't like, it's like you had like a smartphone at that point
in time. So he's just like, "Ugh." Yeah, it was in the time of Telstra,
Big Pond, like dial up stuff, maybe just early broadband or something. But I love that they
actually revisited the Nazi gore-ing thing. They brought it back or made references to the rabbits.
It was good. Anyway, that's what I think when I hear money.net. So keeping the rabbits out.
Hopefully that commercial is on YouTube so I can link it.
And hopefully there's a referral code so I can link it.
Yeah, it's gonna be the most linked thing in all of the show notes. Oh my gosh.
Andrew is linked in.
He is. Yes.
That's a skill, Andrew. You should put referral code generation into your skills.
- Referral code magnet or something.
- That's exactly a very good point actually.
I did, you may remember a few episodes ago,
I asked for people to endorse me on LinkedIn
and a few people did do that and I appreciated it greatly.
They endorsed me for podcasting.
- For podcasting, yeah.
- It was sensational.
It hasn't yet gotten me a job,
but I feel it's just a matter of time.
- Well, I mean, this is technically a job.
You just don't really get paid very much.
Well, I'd get paid more if people started clicking those links.
True. Or, alternatively, join oneprimeplus.com.
It's in the long list.
Yeah, exactly. I was about to ask Martin that.
Where is oneprimeplus.com?
Well, I have a referral code to go back to what Jason just said.
So, Jason, like future Jason doing the show notes, can you please add a little timestamp in the notes that people can click to then go back
in supported apps to what you just said as an answer on my behalf to Andrew's question.
Absolutely.
Beautiful.
Wow. I'm entirely confused by that answer.
Boop beep boop beep. Do you know the best thing about this show? The best thing about
the show is it's my turn to edit.
And it's a type 52.
It's a type of free.
I'm not going to edit fucking time.
What do you say?
I actually swore that.
And you know, you know, the number of times Andrew said, oh, it's long this time that I'm editing always over now and I'm doing it.
It's never always.
Should we just fill it with a bunch of bullshit?
So you have to like.
Have you heard the word about Apple notes?
(laughing)
Martin, could you give us a deep dive
on every default app that is in your dock right now?
That would be really helpful, I think for everybody.
- Right, well, first up,
we'll look for a red dot that is always there.
Finder.
Finder's a great app,
which is persistent throughout the system.
- And three, two, one.
- Next up.
(laughing)
- I'm gonna hit stop, guys.
- That's rather rude, Andrew.
I could go all day.
- Okay, so Final Cut Pro isn't default.
So we'll skip over that one.
Next up, QuickTime.
- In a way, it's kind of the default pro video editor
on the Mac, really, right?
- That's true.
- I would go as far as saying that, so.
- Okay, what else can I say?
- I'm going to watch some basketball.
This is boring.
- What's next?
- QuickTime.
I love a bit of QuickTime.
- Maybe that's actually the true default editor.
That could be the default editor.
What do you mean I don't Andrew?
If you liked a quick time, you would have clicked stop on the recording by now.
Now I like a quick time when I'm editing, Andrew.
Anyway, next up, default app.
Oh, music.
Everyone's favorite.
Oh, that's now it's been a hit for a while.
Yep. Next up, photos.
Actually, I quite like photos.
I got that.
Andrew, I'm speaking.
I'm speaking.
- Photos, I quite enjoy photos.
There are some complaints about the interface.
- I love photos personally.
- I love photos too, it's great.
You'll notice I'm doing it quickly.
Next up, skipping, skipping, skipping, pages.
Now I don't use pages all the time,
but when there is a word processor required,
I find it does the job really nicely.
- You have pages in the dock?
My God.
- You have pages in the dock?
- Yeah, I do.
- Does pages currently have a pen or a pencil?
That's my big question.
- Now this is actually a pet peeve of mine.
Design-wise right so if you look at the pages icon. Yeah, there is the pen yeah
It's like a little twisty one the twisty now the direction
The line that it has drawn is going is actually it's like it's being pushed. It's not good
Yeah, you don't like exactly
So there's to make to make it work
You kind of have to do a bit of inference or 3d
Imagination that it is like on an angle being tilted like you're looking at it from a different
Yeah, it's like a 3d turned into a 2d that you have to like wrap your mind around inception and then it works
Yeah, I hear you. Mm-hmm
Next up is preview. I love a good PDF. I don't like it when it pops up on its own to the side
I want it there all the time near the writing apps that I use. Okay
And then Andrew looks like he's like in pain
But he actually has you know, like when you see those commercials for like where you're taking
Something like a headache relief and it shows you that little animated path.
Targeting the inflammation that's what he looks like right now.
So here's the information while you guys are talking about boring default apps I've just done a score check and it's 5756.
Okay we're getting close.
We're almost there we're like 3 to 17 more apps were right there go ahead just wrap round us out.
I'm actually not going to explain any of them.
I'm just going to do a rapid fire.
So Andrew can go and take the appropriate pill.
Next up we have messages, then mail, then calendar.
That's just messages.
I would argue the worst app was on the wrong side of Mac OS.
It needs to be on the left hand side of your dock, not the right hand side.
No, wrong.
Mine is dead center.
Oh, you're both wrong.
OK, dead center.
Why is it wrong?
Communications goes to the, like that goes to the left.
- On your computer.
(laughing)
That's like saying,
"Oh, your toilet's on that side of the house, that's wrong."
- That actually could be true
depending on the leveling of the ground.
- That's right, but not everyone lives
on the same hill or gradient, do they?
- It's true. - So it needs to be adjusted.
- Right, so you'd wanna make sure
you have that at the high ground.
So that can all-- - Correct.
- Yeah, you don't want that on the low ground.
That is no good.
So I think we've given Andrew enough pain now and extra stuff to edit.
So you watch yourself.
Can you?
So our type 52 is now type 57.
Yeah, here we go in 3, 2, 1.
