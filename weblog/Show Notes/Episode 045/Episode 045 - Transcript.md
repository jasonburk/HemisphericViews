Andrew made a Christmas very basketballing.
I'm just gonna jump into this and say thank you very much for the fine.
Hemispheric uniform addition to my life but I'm guessing that it was linked to a certain someone.
Who follows the show can you explain what's going on and will even include a screenshot of the show notes of what's going on.
Yes so this is a gift to the two of you.
People might remember that a while ago a friend of the show Perth bandits.
Nick Tan created a design for Hemispheric Views basketball team.
He does basketball uniform designs on the side for a bit of fun.
He created a Hemispheric Views one.
It's all well and good to see it on a screen.
It looked nice, but it's not real until you get the real uniform.
And I thought, since both of you are so not into basketball,
what would make a better gift than a basketball uniform jersey
Thank you to Nick.
Nick helped with the teeing up the production and all that kind of stuff.
And I'm super stoked that it got all the way to Jason.
One got all the way to Jason in the US before Christmas.
I did not anticipate that.
Yeah.
I was curious.
I should have asked before.
What was the ship time on that?
Do you have a recollection of when you sent it versus when I received it?
I reckon I sent it at the beginning of December.
So it was only a couple of weeks.
There's a cat.
Well, I just want to say I think it's awesome.
So thank you, Andrew. And also thank you, Nick, because even though I'm not a huge
basketball fan, I've been to games in my life and I like the sport in general.
I'm just not an avid follower like you are.
But to have it actually branded to match this podcast, he did a great job and
it makes it all the more special.
And I'm now going to have the pleasure of wearing this in certain contexts just to have people ask the question, what the hell is that?
Because I actually wore it around another basketball fan I know, and he made the comment, is that some it looks like some sort of European team.
Like, what is this? I was like, well, yes, it's actually part of the niche Euro basketball tour.
And it's not HV or Hemispheric views.
It's Havre.
And that's how you say it.
It's very esoteric.
You wouldn't understand.
But I'm super pleased because it's got each of our favorite numbers.
So we've got it's customized to us.
It's got our surnames on the back.
It's got our Patreon logo at the front.
We're sponsored by Patreon, apparently, with our Patreon, the actual Patreon logo, the HV Shield.
Oneprimeplus.com.
That's it. That's it.
Now, so we'll somehow get photos of us wearing these.
I think Jason, Martin and I have done the right thing.
We're wearing ours today. Jason's somehow putting in a vault or something.
I'm not sure what's going on there.
I am going to frame it in a basketball jersey frame
and hang it on the wall behind me
so that everyone that sees me on a video call,
which if the last year is any indication
will be for the next rest of my life,
they'll see it right up there next to me.
It's gonna be amazing. - It's a good product placement.
It's like when they retire a jersey
and they hang it from the rafters as a legendary player.
Yeah, now, so what I actually want you to do
before you frame it, I think you do need to get tickets
to a Portland Trail Blazers game
and wear the jersey to that.
Since that's your local team.
Martin, you need to wear it to a Hawks game
and I shall wear mine to a Perth Wildcats game.
- I love that he knows all of the teams for everyone else
and when we have no idea.
That's fantastic.
US or otherwise.
Well, if anyone wants to see us play,
come to one prime plus stadium and that is are they called stadiums I don't even know see that's how much I don't know about basketball.
This is actually the one time you can use their proper slogan for one prime plus contextually and what would that be.
Got.
One prime plus stadium.
Dot com.
It's in the.
Dot com.
Yeah.
It's in the.
Oh wow.
One prime plus stadium.
It's in the game.
So good.
Thanks to you, thanks to Nick Tan, and thanks to whoever created these
wonderful jerseys for you, of which I had no idea that was a thing.
That's not something I would have expected.
You could just get made in a, in a low volume quantity, or perhaps you
actually ordered like 10,000 of these and you just have to sit on the other.
You know, you've like boxes of these in your garage or something.
I'm not sure.
Guess what?
Guess what you get when you join oneprimeplus.com.
You used to get a sticker. Now you get a whole jersey without your name on it.
Ultimately, we're going to have a whole team out there. I should say as well, there is
this. Each of us has one. So there's three. There's actually four of these in the wild.
Because Nick Tan himself was so pleased with the design. I made sure that he got a, and as a thank
you from the Hemispheric Views crew, he got a, he got a one as well.
Love it. And his has my name on the back, I assume. Is that?
Yeah, yeah, it's all part of doxxing and identity theft.
Yeah.
Okay, perfect.
Spelled B-U-K-R, I assume, as we've learnt in previous episodes.
Exactly.
Well, that's awesome.
Thank you.
There you go.
Merry Christmas.
Now, I think we need a weather check because one thing about hemispheres is that they're different at Christmas time and all through the year.
That's a fact.
What's happening in your area, Andrew?
What's the weather?
I've heard it's pretty mild.
Hot.
Damn hot.
It is. It is so hot. It is the hottest. I wrote a blog last night on it. We'll link to that in the show notes.
Yeah. If you were going to assign a number to just the general term hot, let's just say there was a scale you could use.
Oh, let's say.
What would that be?
Let's call it 44 degrees Celsius.
Wow.
Which is over 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the past two days. And today, I think it's meant to cool down a little.
we're heading for a mild 39 degrees Celsius today.
So won't quite crack the hundred.
- And that's out of the ordinary for you?
- Look, we're used to hot summers in Perth, but getting to that level of heat, that's
unusual.
Usually we'll get this heat in February, but to have it in December already, ooh baby.
It has been the, it's hard to eat a big Christmas meal when you melt when you go outside.
like a blast furnace you walk outside of the house and as you know we have evaporative
air conditioning works beautifully in this sort of environment but you walk out of any
sort of air conditioned environment and it's just like a blast furnace just.
It is the risk actually increase that the roof of your house is going to blow off Andrew
with this air conditioning in this weather like I think that's the pressure I think the
air is now so thin that you know you can hardly breathe so I think it's fine there you go
Well, here in New South Wales, we are currently in the midst of La Nina, which is a pleasure.
Fortunately, Christmas Day was glorious.
It was really, really warm, beautiful blue skies.
It was perfect for anyone, you know, backyard barbecues or going to the beach or whatever.
Today, which is now the day after Boxing Day, people in the listenership can work all that out.
You know, here in the Commonwealth, we give each other boxes or something.
It's now really cool and breezy and it's going to rain.
So I have no idea.
It's kind of like living in a temperate version
of a tropical climate.
Who knows what's going on.
- Awfully hot, pretty much okay.
And then I'm on the other end of the spectrum
of a little bit chilly.
We are currently at 27 degrees F
or minus three degrees C.
- So beach weather.
- Yeah, basically shorts, tank top.
- Is it snowing?
- It snowed once.
It snowed, today was the first snow actually, December 26th.
- It's not quite the white Christmas.
- It's hard to tell.
I'm not sure if it came before or after midnight.
So--
- Okay, then I'll get you on technicality.
- Yeah, we'd have to like roll the tape back on that,
get a replay, but I think it,
I'm gonna call it white Christmas probably, I think.
That's very different to what we're experiencing here.
So do you sing when, when, when you sing the sort of Bing Crosby's White
Christmas, there's no irony to when you perform it.
No, no.
All of the, the kind of holiday things, they all check out.
Yeah.
Okay.
And on that note, can we, as part of the Hemisphere Review's caroling service, can
we just sing a few bars of White Christmas now?
You absolutely can.
Yeah.
Go for it.
Please do.
All of us on three.
I'll count us down it'll be 321 go and on the go we start to sing.
On the go.
Okay on the go playlist everyone's favorite iPod edition 3 2 1 go.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas just like the ones I used to know.
And copyright strike.
Why was I the only one singing.
Because I was hoping to generate a new theme that I can insert in the show and later edit.
I was singing I accidentally muted it was a mute switch issue.
Gullis both of you.
No I think we've known that for a while.
Bloody snow would melt for hit the ground.
Incidentally Perth give you a beach update.
I'll be chubby.
Big big tradition for many Perth families is to go to the beach on Christmas Day
You would think when it's 40 degrees Celsius
That would be a wonderful day to go to the beach not I because I would burn instantly so not good for me
But many families love it. They went to the beach only to discover
sharks in the water
Lots of people standing on the beach looking at the water not getting in it better than sharks on the land. Well, that's true
That's that's the next imagine. You have a street street shark situation
breaking out and then you got people you got people in the water sharks on the beach it's crazy.
Will you saw what happened in the simpsons when dolphins came back on to land that was disastrous.
How's it going Andrew with spotlight.
Can you spotlight spotlight spotlight is there as a emergency in case of emergency pull ripcord kind of situation.
It does not get my command spacebar keyboard shortcut.
Traditionally that's been owned by LaunchBar for many, many, many years.
Until I realized that LaunchBar was suddenly annoying to me because it seemed like it was
consuming excessive amounts of CPU time.
And it drove me crazy and I was like, "LaunchBar never gets updated.
Never, never, never.
It hasn't seen an update for ages.
The website hasn't been updated.
There's no user support.
There's no community.
There's no plugins being developed for it.
And it was just that point I went, "Stuff it, I'm switching to Alfred."
I didn't even use the trial period.
I just bought the full power pack thing.
Wow.
I was so fired up.
Did it, went all Alfred.
And then about two days after that, LaunchBar released an update.
I'm going to just go out on a limb and assume that you are one of those people
that will open Activity Monitor and go over to the little CPU tab and then search for
LaunchBar or whatever.
And then you'll just sit there and stare at it and kind of force hope that it jumps up
to a number that satisfies your anger.
Is that pretty true?
Is that true?
I will go look at it.
No, I won't.
I don't target apps in that way.
But if I feel like there's a bit of sluggishness happening, I do check Activity Monitor.
And so I did because LaunchBar wasn't working well.
and I did a reboot and it continued to not work well
and I checked activity monitor and it was,
it was like four or 5% CPU or something like that.
- Wow.
- Dead.
- That's ridiculous.
- So can I ask, I just wanna,
I know that there are extra functions
that LaunchBar and Alfred afford you
that you don't find satisfying or present in Spotlight.
What is the number one thing that is so crucial
to your working day or general lifestyle
that disappoints you about Spotlight
that now Alfred offers you?
- If I had to boil it down to one,
'cause there's a number,
'cause these things do a lot of things,
but the number one thing
would be traversing file directories.
The nature of the things that I do
is that I have numerous folders with similar files
I need to find, like this sort of,
it's a pattern of work, but the fault,
so the files are very similar,
but they're in self-contained directories
for that project.
All right, so if I just do a spotlight search,
it's often hard to know if you've got quite the right file.
So I wanna be able to drill in and out of file trees
with my keyboard.
And you can trigger that off quickly
with LaunchBar or Alfred.
Actually quicker in LaunchBar, ironically.
- I care about none of that.
- Yeah, and I think you could really tidily
and efficiently replace this whole system
with an entire grid of desktop alias icons
to all of your favorite folders.
And then you could navigate like a gigantic puzzle
across the grid.
And then you could kind of have instant efficient launching
straight into the folder that you want,
but then with a kind of, I don't know,
puzzle fun along the way.
What do you reckon?
- I'm not gonna have icons on my desktop.
- Can I tell you the features of Alfred
that are actually make it worth using?
- Sure. - Sorry, I'm getting
really hot in this thing that I have to take it off.
Keep going.
- No, you gotta take the T-shirt off.
You leave the singlet on.
Have you never played basketball?
What are you doing?
- Of course he's never played basketball.
- Goodness.
- I'm amazed he even knows what a basketball is.
Hi.
- Hello, sorry, continue.
- No, I finished.
- Oh, (beep)
- So the file thing, file traversal.
- Yep.
- That's interesting, I suppose.
That is definitely not a reason I use Alfred.
If I had to give you three, I would give you snippets.
Great, love me a snippet.
I need to explore that more.
Workflows in general, being able to just create
shortcuts to do stuff so I can type
a little command to do a thing in the shelves
without having to open up Terminal or whatever.
And then what's the last one?
I said snippets already.
the workflows.
Launching an app.
Yeah, I mean, the launching the app thing, that's just kind of, that just feels
like a thing you do on a Mac.
I don't know. It's, Spotlight started it all, obviously,
or whatever that one was 20 years ago.
Well, I got corrected because I accidentally said Quicksilver was the first, but it
turns out LaunchBar predates Quicksilver.
Oh, well, OK, Quicksilver was the first that anyone cared about.
I'll say that. How about that?
But yeah, the snippets thing I love, being able to have snippets just right at your fingertips.
The workflows are great.
You can kind of build, you can go nuts with them, but I'd have a couple of basic ones.
And the one I use a lot is tying it in with an app called, it's either, I guess, Numi,
N-U-M-I.
It's like a calculator-y thing, kind of like Solver.
- Yeah, that's a setup.
- And then you can just do like crazy calculation stuff
just from that.
So I can say command space 20 Fahrenheit in C
and just have it do it there.
- I hate that in my life.
- Or you know, eight gallons in milliliters or whatever.
Just being able to do quick stuff like that
from a spotlight type thing,
which I think spotlight does some of that now.
- Yeah, it does.
But this just allows you to do almost anything.
You can do real-time currency conversion.
You can say how many bytes in 20 zettabytes or whatever.
Just does it.
I mean, I think Spotlight would probably be fine
for most people.
And a lot of it's just, if you start using something,
you just keep using it.
So, yeah, I don't know.
I never got into LaunchBar, I think,
just 'cause I've always used Alfred.
Oh, and you can theme it.
So you can make it look nice
and have it be like bigger text on the screen
or just have it do that kind of stuff.
- As the spotlighter of the group,
you know, surprise, surprise,
it kind of comes down to this for me.
It's a very similar thing
using something like LaunchBar and Alfred.
'Cause I did actually try them
after you've both brought them up before.
It falls into a similar camp for me
as things like automation or home automation.
I'm very impressed by the feature list
and the things that you can do when you fiddle
and line up a whole heap of functions
that you couldn't do before
or necessarily couldn't do as quickly or in the same way.
But it's all in the setup of the stuff for me
that I kind of lose interest.
I go all the time that I'm setting up doing these shortcuts
or these home automation things linked to this light bulb
that I then have to worry about replacing
rather than just doing this
or going up and flicking a light switch.
It kind of, personally, I lose interest
in the customization of things,
which might sound very, very horrendous or shocking
to people who listen to this podcast.
It's like, isn't all the fun setting up all this tech stuff?
For me, if it takes more effort to achieve that efficiency,
it's kind of lost me.
- Yeah, I think the biggest difference is like Spotlight
does, and I'm just gonna pick and say it does six things
and that's it.
Whereas Alfred and LaunchBar both do,
let's say 1000 things.
I don't really care that they do 1000 things,
but I like the fact that it gives every single individual
person the ability to pick like their six things that they want.
And it's great that it's there.
Yeah. And I don't,
I'm sure there are people that use everything that exists in, you know,
pick your whichever one. I certainly don't. I use probably six.
But it's like the six that are important to me. So I don't know. I, yeah,
it's, it's,
they're all kind of converging together into one thing.
And I don't think spotlight will ever do all the stuff the others do.
And it shouldn't because it would just be too confusing and weird.
I often wonder if normal people just using a Mac day to day even
know what spotlight is.
No, I don't think so.
It feels a little bit, I mean, it's super easy, but it feels a little bit like an
advanced kind of tool for the average computer user.
It's an interesting question because I can't remember where I read it, but there was
something about, it might've been one of the many blogs that we Mac users generally
follow, I can't remember, but it was talking about how increasingly younger kids at school
aren't learning how to navigate a Finder or Windows Explorer or whatever file directory,
they just use search. So I'm inclined to say that more and more younger people are just
using whatever the search tool is on computer X, you know, whatever we're talking about.
Whereas older people, and I use older to cover a broad range of generations, they don't necessarily
know that it's there. So whereas they rely on more of the path bar or going through the
columns and things. So I think one group is maybe ignorant about one thing and the other
is ignorant of the other.
Can I ask you a question coming from LaunchBar to Alphard? One of the things that gets me
every time is that LaunchBar you just typed whatever you need to type, but whether it
was an application or a folder or a file name or what have you. In Alphard, and you just
would type. In Alfred, first of all, if you want to search for a file, you have to start
with the space bar to start to limit your scope to files. And there, but there is an
option in the preferences that says you can turn extras on. So under the default results,
there's, you can tick the essential, the essentials category, which is preferences and contacts.
And then there's these extras, which are folders, documents. So then it indexes all of those
I would presume.
But it says, don't do it.
Alfred works most efficiently if you only have essentials ticked and use the open keyword
to find files.
Now, that's, it's kind of annoying because that's what Launchpad did all that automatically.
Alfred is providing me a way to do it, but it's saying don't do it.
Do you have a take on that?
I have two takes on that.
My understanding is they all basically just use the spotlight index anyway.
So you're kind of always using spotlight no matter what you're using.
I assume they're saying that because probably if you have a bajillion files,
it probably really bogs down. The,
the thing that's doing the searching would be my assumption.
But if you have a normal amount of files, whatever that is, I don't know.
I would just turn them all on.
What's your second take?
It was,
Oh, it was those two takes in one.
It was just that everything's using spotlight anyway. And second to that,
just do it.
See, just to be the annoying one here,
we like Apple products and generally the Mac
because we say it just works,
but then with tools like this,
we introduce complexity that raises questions
that we didn't have before.
So I say power to you if you wanna use this stuff,
but I have never once considered the thing
that you just mentioned, Andrew.
- Well, if Spotlight could let me go back and forth
in directories, I would probably be much more likely
to use it, but it just looks-
- Yeah, but isn't this stuff
that you get in the Finder anyway?
like you've got your path by, you've got your columns.
- I think we've gone down this path many times.
- I think so.
Okay, I'm not gonna open that can or wherever it was again.
- This brings me to another point recently
that I think I'm gonna just go ahead
and expose Andrew on this.
He talks a lot about being a Mac user and so forth,
but recently there was a tweet from him
where he basically just called out that the Macintosh is bad.
He said in not so many words, Macintosh is so bad, period.
And I just, I feel like-
And his iCloud account was deleted.
I felt a little attacked, first of all, because I, you know, I felt I'd been lied to, that he's always saying that he's a Mac user.
We'd never actually seen any of these Macs.
So we just assumed.
Not to mention I named my son after the computer.
So he's been removed from the group.
Exactly.
Exactly.
And then I see he sends, he starts sending pictures of this PC with all these glowy
lights in them.
And I just, I don't know.
I'm really, there's like some red flags here.
I can explain.
Yeah.
I mean, I, I, I'm sorry.
I have to put you on the hot seat like that, but.
Don't apologize.
Do it.
Yeah.
Um, we're going to need some answers here.
You know, the hating of the Macintosh, the, the PC photos that you've been sending.
It's all been a little much and I just don't think we can take it anymore.
Yeah, no, that's fair.
Fair call.
You I've gotten out on the Twitter.
Now, anybody who knows me will know that Twitter is my basketball outlet.
That's I just vent randomly on Twitter about basketball.
That's why you started talking about windows.
Yeah.
And I did say Macintosh is bad.
It's so bad.
I think I said Macintosh.
You said so bad.
Period.
Yeah.
So bad.
Macintosh is so bad.
However, in my defense, if you look at that tweet, it was Macintosh with a mc.
It was McIntosh, not Mac Intosh.
So, which Scotsman annoyed you?
It was not a Scotsman at all, it was an American playing for the Tasmania Jack Jumpers.
Mikhail McIntosh.
He's terrible. He is a rubbish player.
Wow. We're just attacking people now on the show.
There goes our basketball audience.
He's a lovely guy, but he can't play basketball very well.
OK.
So that was--
- Okay, so you had a excuse for that, okay.
- Yeah.
- And what about all these PC photos you've been sending
that have been, I mean, honestly,
they really were pretty not safe for work,
I'd have to say, not for my work anyway.
- Well, I've been using Macs for a while,
but none of them ever had glowing LED lights.
- No, for good reason. - And you know the one thing
that I want on a computer?
I want some glowing LEDs.
And the only way I get those is by buying my kid a gaming PC.
Ah, okay.
Sorry. Merry Christmas.
You can see, though, how all of these pieces of information separately.
Oh, yeah.
Piecing them together, it just it doesn't paint you in a good light.
No, I can imagine you on the crazy board with the string, the red string, drawing lines.
Yeah.
So, yeah, I see where you're coming from.
Now, if there's one thing that we've learned, it's that when Andrew is supposed to buy a present for his son, he actually buys a present for himself.
So, how have you been enjoying your gaming PC, Andrew?
Oh my God. Windows.
Windows. How does anybody live with their Windows?
Bloody hell.
It's so bad.
It's so bad.
Like, it was doing the first run kind of.
And first of all, you got the problem.
Do I set up with my account and like my existing Microsoft ID?
Or do I create like his PC and it's but I was trying to set up before and to even get a logging edge like create a Microsoft account and he's like not 13.
So how do you do that you just got to acknowledge these 13 and pretend.
It's got break the law.
Okay, basically anyway all that I could go into that for half an hour.
But what I was doing it was it was what I was trying to set up a family account for him.
So I was I ended up creating an account for me and then I was creating a family junior managed account for him
it was in the process of
Validating that it had a window up like it said in one of the settings windows
It was doing a thinking thing and I looked at a little Wi-Fi indicator and I was like, oh, what's my signal strengths a bit low
I'll just click that and see what's going on with that while it's thinking about that thing over there
Can do we clarify the windows version that we're dealing with us this in at the moment is a windows 10 device okay?
Apparently ready for 11, but I haven't pushed the button
Yes, there Intel inside there I think there's AMD inside
Carol I was gonna say there should be a sticker to tell you you can just go check that I think it's AMD
I
Click the little Wi-Fi thing. Mm-hmm. Oh
It doesn't multitask the we like
That that family setup thing that was going on. Oh clearly you don't actually care about that anymore
You want to see Wi-Fi?
So we're gonna blow that window away and replace that information with the Wi-Fi settings page
It's a
Freak, okay. So there's a back button in the corner of the the window
I guess I click that to go back to my family setup, but no
It just takes me back to the home page of the settings app
How do I get back to my family I guess I just.
Your family's gone.
Traverse back to family to the set and you go there and it's like.
You want to set up a family I just was you are halfway through doing it and I clicked Wi-Fi and it just.
It was like why is that why is that such a destructive action clicking on a Wi-Fi icon.
But the lights in the computer and I see just keep looking at that you don't actually use the system it's just a light show just so bad and just.
And then so I finally get it I went through started all over again with the family set up.
It kind of it must have gotten halfway through because it recognised the email address that was created for him.
I got all that booted into his account but then on every boot of his because he's a standard user not an administrator,
All these like third party AMD Ryzen driver needs authentication to run.
So he's getting bombarded with prompts at every boot to load this crap. I'm like, well, how do you just authorize those but not everything else?
I made him an administrator and he can just have at it.
That's dead standard Windows security right there you start out with nothing realise you can't do anything and then you just give everyone admin and hope for the best.
So now that he's an admin because I want to hear about some of the fun stuff briefly which games does he want to play like what's this for the general pain.
So he's still pretty young and early in his gaming adventures so it started out with.
Establish that when you illegally accepted the you love him being 13 yeah yeah so you just want to play roblox and minecraft excuse me.
Basic kid stuff.
He has been playing a bit of subnautica on because I have a steam account as well and I had subnautica so he had been playing on my computer and so he switched what is that.
Underwater exploration.
Puzzle solving game you swim through the ocean.
But are we talking about a third person looking at a puzzle over the third person so you got hands.
Can you swim in your hold tools and catch fish in.
Are you amphibious or are you actually of the water entirely human there a scuba tank involved you're a human that is crash landed on a water planet.
In the spaceship.
Who's not a splash landing yes good point it's it's good game so he's got into that but then so he's but then that that's opened up the world steam gaming so yesterday he bought the escapists to.
With his own pocket money.
Escapists to wear.
Get to get out of jail you work with your mates and you can get out of jail.
He did already break the law starting this adventure so this might be a handy skill to have for later and today he's ready to speak back again and he's bought terraria.
Which I know nothing is is his piggy bank your wallet is that how this is you just left your credit card in steam right is now yeah but we make him we make him hand over cash so he gets the feeling of a transaction.
Is your son Macaulay Culkin?
Is he tracking this in YNAB is my question.
No, I am trying to encourage him down that pathway and he doesn't seem as interested.
What to sign up for a YNAB account and then get disappointed.
He's just tracking money, he's just got no interest.
He doesn't know the difference, he's like 50%.
He's got no interest, you've got to sort out that rate.
$20, $50, he doesn't care, he's just like, oh, it's just my...
No, you want to go with a high interest when it goes to money, not no interest.
No interest is not ideal. That's what I've learned.
So anyway, PC adventures, anybody who uses a PC has either never used a Mac.
Oh God, yep.
Or they have Stockholm Syndrome. They've been convinced that PCs are fine and this is the way computers work, and they just accept the pain.
But if you could show them there is a different way of doing this stuff and a better way. A Mac's definitely a better way.
Everything could be improved right but Windows has a lot more scope for improvement.
What are the other the adults I think it's I think it's hit ceiling I think let me let me tell you about a little thing we like to call Windows 11.
One better than 10 okay we put the start of the middle middle center aligned.
Didn't the Mac do that in Mac OS 10.0 and they put the Apple in the middle?
Can I just say briefly on the center alignment thing in Mac OS?
I know a lot of people seem to be offended by that, but this is where I think the complaints
get a little bit unreasonable.
You don't have to like the central alignment or you can nitpick about why it's somehow
not ideal design wise, but I think the Microsoft thing to do would be to introduce the central
alignment, but only do it for the top level aesthetically of the system.
As far as I've seen, unless I've missed something, and I apologize if I have, Apple has done
it everywhere in the system.
So they've made a decision for better or worse, but at least it's consistent.
And please, if you have found it elsewhere, send us something on micro.blog on Twitter
to show me that I'm wrong.
But I think that's where Apple users sometimes aren't quite grateful enough that they have
taken the care to make sure that it's the same everywhere.
I mean, that's my favourite part of using Windows is every time I use it, I feel like Indiana Jones because every single menu that you go to, every layer of menu takes you back three to five years in actual time.
So, you start at Windows 11 and by the fourth or fifth click, you're back into like DOS.
It's amazing.
And then when you try to get out, back up through the levels, there's some digital boulder chasing you to stop you.
It's great. I love it.
You're like, "Oh, this looks beautiful."
And then you're like, "Wait, how did I get back
to Windows XP?
Oh, what the hell?
This is Windows 95 now.
Ah, yeah, that's great."
(upbeat music)
- Now talking about devices and particularly game stuff,
'cause this is what Andrew bought for his son.
It's all about games.
Jason, you've been posting about a little pocket device.
What's the deal here?
- Yeah, the analog pocket.
I bought it, I think, two or three years ago.
This is one of those things.
It may I had no idea. I'm like, oh, what's this new thing? And I don't think
it was a it wasn't a kick starter, but it kind of felt like one where you you
buy it and then you you're fifty fifty and if it's ever even going to happen
or you just threw money into a fireplace. So that's where you start and
then you just never really know when it's going to show up and I completely
forgot about it that I even ordered it, which is hilarious because it was not cheap. I think
it was $200, which I think they're even more now because chip shortage. But yeah, so I
bought it I think two years ago, maybe a little over two years ago. And then it's one of those
where it's perpetually like, "Oh, delays. Oh, this manufacturing. Oh, this thing happened.
Oh, this, that, the other thing.
And it's like, okay, whatever.
Like this is never coming.
Then I got an email that was the reverse and said, Hey, it's shipping in earlier
than we said, and it was like, how do you delay it?
And then now it's available.
This, this scam goes really deep.
Okay.
Sure.
Over, under promise and kind of deliver.
Yeah, I guess so.
And then they're like, well, it's going to be there by the end of the year.
And they meant this year, which was wow.
Okay.
Shocking.
And then it shipped, wow, okay.
Then it showed up and I had it.
So the Analog Pocket, it came, it works, it's a real thing.
It's unfortunate in some respect
because if I'm telling, anything I'm saying right now,
if you're completely sold on it and think,
oh, I really want one, well, good luck waiting
until I think like 2024 or something now
'cause they did another pre-order set
and there's like groups you get into
and I think one of them quite literally goes out to 2024.
I don't understand that,
but I'll still talk about it a little bit,
even though no one can really get one.
So I don't know how valuable that is to anyone,
but what it is, is a completely like custom built
FPGA based handheld system that plays--
- What's FPGA? - What's FPGA?
- Oh boy, here we go.
- PGA is golf.
Field programmable gate array, I believe is what it is.
And hopefully, I've misremembered that and everybody's mad now.
But anyway, it's like a very customized chip to do like a single thing really well.
So it's designed to mimic and use actual cartridges from Game Boy, Game Boy Advance.
I think like the Link system.
There's a few others.
Oh, so you have to have the cartridges?
Like it's not an emulator as such.
It is not built strictly as an emulator, no.
It is a bona fide reproduction that can read
and actually use the data from real cartridges,
but it has the most gorgeous screen on it.
And there are filters that can basically
either make it mimic to look like it did
back on the really old crappy screens,
or use native pixel for pixel mapping on the screen.
It just, I don't know, I'm not any by any means like a,
you know, retro game aficionado or whatever.
I mean, I love playing them,
but I don't track any of this stuff day to day,
but it's freaking phenomenal
what they've done with this thing.
The build quality is great.
The screen just playing these old,
old Game Boy games with this new screen.
It's simultaneously nostalgic
and feels new at the same time
where the games just look so good that a lot of games now are built to look old
anyway, right?
Like pixel art is like, you can't walk one foot in a different direction and
not run into 50 pixel art games now.
But to see these originals kind of in this new light, that's not just an
emulator, I think it's a really cool thing.
It's super niche, like very few people would actually, you know, get anything
out of this, especially if you don't have any of these games.
So you had the cartridges.
Can I just clarify?
I have some, yeah.
So you didn't have to go troll eBay or something to find?
No, but I now have an excuse to go to some of our local, like old game stores and just buy a bunch of cartridges that I don't need.
So that'll be good.
I'm looking forward to that.
So I'm not the biggest gamer, which we've established before.
But what I think is really cool about this is I remember as a kid playing Halo and thinking, oh, what a great game, blah, blah, blah, for example.
and then thinking, oh, imagine future graphics or something, or where this is going to go when
they continue it. And then you would play sequels. And yes, they'd be sharper or have, you know,
more detail in the graphics or whatever, but you lost kind of the charm of that first one.
But then when you play the first one, unless you get that remastered anniversary edition that they
put out, you're kind of playing something on a dickier, smaller res thing. So, you get to have
the old experience, but refreshed. Yeah. Yeah.
Why reinvent the wheel? Why do a new version of the game when it can just look better?
Yeah, yeah, I played through Mario 3. I just beat it the other day. And it was again, it's this weird thing where it's not strictly nostalgia where I, you know, I have an old Game Boy and I'm just playing an old Game Boy that I found in the attic.
But it's not new either. It's this kind of weird. I don't even know how to describe it.
Jason loves buying things.
Yeah, Andrew, you're right. Jason loves buying things. I'm looking at the notes and I can
see that in his tech life, he has gained yet another product, but he's also deleted some
services. Can you give us a rundown on these massive tech events in your life, Jason?
Oh, I know. 2021 coming in strong at the end here with the purchases. I gotta tell you,
it's because of, you know why? EOFI, it's the end of my fiscal year. So I'm just buying
Happy office buying stuff like crazy because I'm going to write it all off obviously.
I can't wait your June how about you Martin that's we're going to get crazy in June.
It's going to be off the charts see you in office works.
Yeah yeah we should we should meet at a neutral office looks like.
Meet you at Officeworks, Cooper PD.
Adelaide, yeah.
Adelaide, sure.
I just thought we'd go underground. Officeworks underground,
surely, in Cooper PD.
Oh man, if we had a meetup at an Officeworks, that would be
the most on-brand thing ever.
Well, the cool thing is that they have
that desk section, right, and we can
all occupy the desk that we want in swivel chairs.
We can do a lot of sharing.
We can bring a laptop and record there.
It's like, "Excuse me, sirs,
could you please leave the store?"
We've checked in with their QR code.
Let's yeah, we're testing this furniture.
You wouldn't need to sit in a chair for a while before you decide if it's for you.
If they even bother us for a second, be like happy EOF-y and they'll be like, oh, you guys are on it.
You can stay.
Anyway, sorry, we digress.
Jason, you've bought something and deleted other things.
What's happened?
Which one did I buy?
Are you, I'm assuming you're referring to the.
I'm reordering the notes as we go.
So just check there.
I'm being a felled foot.
Oh, look at that.
Look at those notes just moving around.
You're probably talking about the iPad mini.
Correct.
That I purchased on a whim as I do.
Yeah, I have a lot of iPads right now.
It's kind of out of control.
He's got one on every finger.
I'm trying to hawk one on Discord as we speak.
So everybody that's on that OnePrime+ train, check out the Discord.
So I've been using two iPads for the last like month.
the Relic 12.9 inch/13 inch iPad Pro, the square one, like the first square one, which
I have to say, it still is amazing.
There's nothing it can't do.
How is that possible?
The 2018 iPad, I feel like it's probably good for another at least three years, which is
baffling.
Especially, yeah, anyway, and I've been using the 11-inch iPad Pro, kind of side-by-side
for different things.
I came to a realization that I don't use either one of them like an iPad because they just,
they're glued in their keyboards and that's where they live, which is, I mean, yes, I
can, I'm aware you can take it out.
I don't need to know.
I do that constantly with mine.
I don't need to know how magnets work, I get that.
But once I put it in the keyboard, it's just like, nope, that's just kind of where it lives.
So basically I'm carrying around two laptops
and that felt weird.
So I was like, what if, I don't really like the 11 inch
for reading stuff or consuming stuff so much
'cause it's small but it's still kinda not small.
The 13 inch iPad is obviously not,
you're not gonna just be holding that thing like a book
'cause it's pretty hefty.
- It's a bruschetta on that thing.
- Yeah, yeah, it's great as a laptop in a keyboard.
Fantastic love it for that. So I thought what if I had an iPad that was a
Computer 13 and what if I had an iPad that was just an iPad that couldn't put in a keyboard even if I wanted to
Mm-hmm. Well, how do I do that? Do I get an iPad air? Not really
It's basically the same size as the 11 also goes in the keyboard. So what's gonna happen to it?
It's gonna end up in the keyboard. Yeah foiled
What if there was an iPad that couldn't go in a keyboard?
big brain, right
iPad mini
So I thought I'm gonna get an iPad mini in a little flippy case thing and just kind of use it as a book
slash
Device that I can look at stuff on and then I'll use the big iPad for like a computer replacement
When I'm not on my iMac
So I went down to the Apple Store and bought one
And now I have one and I have a couple of thoughts
I've been using it for a little while I actually went with the black one because I thought it looked really nice with the orange case.
This is the space grey.
Yeah I was orange for Australian listeners.
Orange.
Not orange.
It's orange here or orange there.
I would normally get the silver but they don't come in silver they come in black.
Starlight.
Starlight.
purple and pink I think.
Starlight's kind of like champagne that lost its fizz.
Yeah, I don't know, I just, the starlight isn't, it's like a, it's not gold, but it's not silver, it's just,
I don't know, I just, I'm not really, I wasn't that into it.
Silver, normal silver, I would have just got normal silver, they didn't have it.
The pink is not pink at all, so, if it was like pink, I would have got that one, but it wasn't.
I like the purple, but it's kind of like a lavender candle you'd get at the hippie shop.
Yeah, the purple is nice too, and it's kind of a gray, it's like a gray almost.
It's like a gray purple, but anyway, I thought the black one looked the best with the orange
flippy case, so I went with that one.
It's a great little device.
I have only been using it for a couple of days.
I'm still within my 14-day return window.
I'm still 50/50 on keeping it, I have to say.
I'm not like, "Oh my gosh," for a couple of reasons.
One, it doesn't have ProMotion.
I knew that going into it, but I thought, settle down.
It's a smaller screen.
Maybe it like doesn't matter as much.
It matters.
It's not promotion.
It's just not.
So, that's probably the biggest issue I have with it.
I went into it, can I interrupt for a minute?
I was in an Apple store a while ago and I looked at the iPad mini because it was when they were talking about the scrolling, doing that tearing sort of thing.
The jelly thing.
Yeah, scroll.
And usually I don't notice those things and I can actually see it on the mini.
I was like, Ooh, yeah, it does.
But the scroll.
Interesting.
Yeah.
I don't know what that is.
And I didn't think that I was seeing that, but what I do feel like I'm feeling is that
I feel like it's, even though it's the, the latest and greatest chip, it's the
A15, I think, or whatever is the latest one.
It feels slow sometimes.
And I don't, and now you just said that jelly thing again, which I forgot about.
I'm wondering if maybe it's that that's making it feel slow.
Is it possible because iOS and iPadOS, obviously, they use so many different animations,
exiting apps and things that don't necessarily exist on the Mac, that you would notice it more
if there is a difference with the ProMotion. Like you're so used to it now with the other iPad and
the iPhone that things are jumping in and out really quickly that the same speed animation
actually looks ever so slightly choppier, like it's an illusion of the graphics.
I think that could be it. That's possible, yeah. Because it just doesn't, it feels like
an iPad Air 2 or something where it's just kind of like, "Hmm, doesn't feel like I just
bought this yesterday so that's that's another one where I'm.
It's getting better I mean I'm getting it's not getting better I'm getting more used to it which is not really the best way to go about.
Keeping or buying technology shouldn't be like I'll just do it.
And those first few days it's probably doing all the photo indexing and all that kind of stuff in the background.
Yeah, yeah.
So, I'm gonna give it the full like, you know, week and a half or so to really find out.
And form factor wise is exactly what I would want from kind of a little iPad.
I love that my pencil too, I can just flip back and forth between the big iPad and the little one.
And it's literally just attach it for half a second, take it back off and it's already...
Oh, it's that easy, is it?
Yeah, it's super fast.
I don't know how it's that fast given that I'm pretty sure it's Bluetooth and usually Bluetooth
switching is kind of... Come on, like get over to the other one.
This is all very interesting because I've been super tempted to get one myself.
And it's super like it's adorable when you put the pencil on it how it's just like
it's like the right little... It's just cute how it fits on there.
I made the mistake too of doing like a migration from the 11-inch iPad. I shouldn't have done that.
I should have just started the mini fresh because now I'm just spending all this time undoing
everything because they just they work differently. An iPad that sits in a keyboard,
you know, smart keyboard thing, it's just a different beast that you're not going to use
them the same. So I would recommend starting from scratch. So I don't know if I've really
sold you on it, but I think it's not doom and gloom.
The size is exactly what I wanted.
I wanted this exact size for the intended purpose of being,
this is my iPad now, whereas my 13 inch iPad pro is my
computer. That's the way I, that's how I see them.
I think to sum it up, Jason,
how many Andrew thumbs do you give the all new iPad mini?
Am I allowed to dole out Andrew thumbs? Is that part of the contract?
I'm just doing it. I don't care. You just, just take the thumbs.
- Okay, I'm gonna give it a solid four Andrew thumbs.
- Fantastic.
- And like maybe two and a half extra globe emojis.
Just throwing that in there.
- That's a rave review, I reckon.
- Yeah, you'll know if the device is for you,
I guess is what I would say.
Is it the kind of device where it can be your only,
and again, this is all caveats all the way down,
but would this be my only iPad?
No, definitely not.
I don't really feel like I could get a lot of stuff done
or created on this.
I could if I had to, but if you're gonna have one iPad,
go get the iPad Air.
That, it's that easy.
That's the most general, universal iPad you can get.
If you feel you need extra whiz-bang features
from the iPad Pro, go for it.
But even now, like the iPad Air working with the smart keyboard and all that,
leaves very little reason to get an iPad Pro for most people.
Most people.
Now, something I want to hear about quickly, because I think we've had to kick this like a can down the road across a few topic pool show notes sections.
Can you tell us very quickly, Jason, why you've deleted PayPal and Venmo and
why this is important?
Oh, uh, because you put this in here a while ago.
Oh yeah. Simple answer. Um,
much like in the past years of,
of removing Google from my life and other companies,
Amazon, et cetera. Uh,
I don't align with PayPal on anything and I think they're crap.
So I deleted their account or my account with them and
Venmo's owned by them. So then they got deleted too. I'm not going to be.
Never even heard the name. I'll be honest. I don't know if that makes me stupid,
I've never heard of it.
I think they got acquired by PayPal.
They were like, it's like a give people money
kind of thing.
Like, oh, we split a bill on a meal.
Like, send me $10 kind of thing.
So, and it's the worst one ever.
It's like got this public aspect to it where there's like a public feed
and it just shows who's sending money to other people for what.
It's like, what the hell is wrong with you?
Why would you want to do that?
Anyway, um, I'm, you know, it's much like how there was Facebook and Instagram and
Instagram got bought, but it's like, oh, I hate Facebook, but I still use Instagram.
It was like, no, Venmo is PayPal, delete, gone.
But you tell yourself what you need to sleep at night, but that's.
Yeah, it's, it's bogus.
So anyway, they just fall into the category slash bucket of companies that I don't want to do
business with personally.
So gone.
So has that been replaced by anything or they're just gone?
Because I can see a what's next they're just gone I I think it at some point it will be a thorn in my side because I will.
Sell something to somebody and they'll say oh then you and I'll be like nope oh PayPal nope.
So do you take a check in the mail yeah it.
It's it's one of those things where it's it'll be a minor inconvenience at some point but I don't care willing to take that.
[Music]
Media Corner
I'm gonna kick off here because I think this is more important than what anyone else has to say
I already know what's coming
And look, I'm not gonna go straight into it
Sorry, not. I will go straight into it
But I'm not gonna go deeply into it
There's gonna be no spoilers because I know that it's early on
on. Not everyone has seen it.
Spiderman go home.
Exactly. I wish he would go home because I'm sick of Spiderman.
Oh, that's another media corner. We can talk forever about how I'm over Spiderman and
discussing which one's best. But Andrew also hasn't seen the two sequels that precede this
sequel and the movie that I'm talking about, which Jason has been taunting me about.
Airplane 2.
My message for ages because it came out later in Australia is The Matrix Resurrections.
I want to make a brief statement here and just say that I have.
Been anticipating this movie probably more than any film I have in my life at least since the Matrix revolutions in 2003 so you can see I've been waiting for a while.
I knew I would probably like this film but I liked it even more than I thought I would and I think it does in a way Jason may disagree Andrew you still haven't seen it.
Yeah there we go I'm just checking just check it out what this movie did yeah I hope so what this movie does is considering that it's 18 years between the third film and now this fourth film considering the fandom that goes along with it the whole transmedia thing across movies games comics whatever.
Same way with Star Wars when it was rebooted or extended however you want to put it there's a lot of difficulty in pleasing old fans.
And also matching current day expectations or how things have moved on from an original in a series or franchise I think this does a way better job than what Star Wars did in the way that people kind of watch the force awakens and go.
Yeah that's a new hope all over again I thoroughly enjoyed episode 7 of Star Wars but could see that it was really like.
A carbon copy refreshed what it but what did not have a set for what the Matrix Resurrections does as the fourth movie in the franchise is engaging a kind of respect of the old.
And the inclusion of those things and new look and new themes particularly from tech culture today and how it's moved on from this kind of pre white UK fear but it also goes extremely meta in the way that it refers to previous films in the franchise I went ruin how it does it.
but I was super impressed that it combined the old, the new,
and a kind of self-awareness that a movie about systems
and sentience and self-awareness should do.
So I would strongly encourage you to go and see
the fourth movie, and if you haven't,
watch the trilogy beforehand so you can get to it.
- Yeah, I watched it before Martin.
I just wanna make sure everybody knows that.
And I went into it far differently than you did.
I wouldn't say that I didn't care
because I deeply care about the Matrix.
I think I was more apprehensive about it's been so long,
is this going to do anything
that's actually wanted or needed
or is this simply going to be,
"Hey look, we took something old and gave it to you again
'cause we literally have no ideas left in the universe
except remaking everything again."
Signed Hollywood.
But that being said, we did watch it as soon as it came out,
which was before Martin saw it.
And then I think we enjoyed it, I would say.
It's hard to, I don't know,
I'm not good at talking about movies
without talking about specific parts of them.
So I'm gonna try to just say almost nothing
for fear of being the person that spoils something.
But they did a good job, I thought, in general
with what they were trying to do with the movie,
which doesn't tell you anything, I'm sorry.
But they clearly had an idea
and I think they executed that idea well,
at least in my expert movie watching review.
- And I would add to that and just say,
it's the self-awareness that you notice
when watching this movie, because if there's any text
or in this case, movie that has been analyzed to bits,
particularly through the lens of philosophy,
religion, references to other literature, all that stuff,
it is the Matrix franchise.
So, I generally avoid reading reviews,
but I've read some reviews of this film
And I've, funnily enough, a lot of the positive ones came from gaming websites, whereas some
of the negative ones came from film review websites.
And I think it's kind of popular for people to rag on this franchise and try to be this,
let's say, academic approach in reviewing it, because everyone's very philosophical
about it.
I think you can't just write something in 500 words about this movie and say it was
bad, because, as you said, Jason, so much thought has gone into it.
They've clearly thought it's the right time.
and I don't know if you two know this but Lana Wachowski, one of the two Wachowskis who directed
this movie, she continued it. The actual idea to make this, she was kind of prompted to do it after
they lost their parents. It was her grieving process. So I don't think this is the general
Hollywood machine just going, "Yeah, let's go and make this and trot it out." They had no real
intentions to continue this. The story was actually continued by The Matrix Online, which was the game
That followed the third movie so she was prompted to do this after an event in her life so I think it shows I thought it was a game.
Is it good there was it was an online game called the Matrix online did not do well.
Yeah it didn't last.
So anyway Andrew thank you for waiting what do you have to say that spider-man.
No, not much. No, I won't take people's too much time with it. We went because it was my son's birthday. He turned six and he has loved Spider-Man since he was about two.
Love this episode.
He has watched like the other two modern Spider-mans multiple times.
Despite all that, despite them being played on our TV so many times, I actually had no idea of what happened in them because I just tuned them out.
I don't really watch.
The only Spider-mans I remember are the old Tobey Maguire Spider-mans.
And he was a whinger.
Can we be fair on that?
He got bitten, he whinges, an upside down kiss.
He was annoying and like but he he is my spider-man. I guess you would have to say. Oh
No, he will never be my spider-man. So look going into this one. I did had no really
Yeah, it was more it was more just a case of going to the cinema to keep your six-year-old happy
We went to the big screen experience
What does that mean cinema like they call it the the it's the Hoyt's extreme screen
No like IMAX now we have IMAX here it's just like a bigger version of a screen so instead of being it's just bigger screen.
Comfort more immersive.
Yep yep.
And did you like the movie it was good it was fun it was like just it was just a couple of hours of entertainment you know you didn't have to think too heavily on it.
Action scenes what they can do with action scenes these days in movies is ridiculous I mean it's all it's all just green screen a computer.
Computer generated thing but it's still amazing and the amount of work that it must take to make those effects look like a Mac pros.
On the topic of green screens though I will just say they are moving more and more to actually having screens as sets that display the scenery there's a great video of I think they did it for the Mandalorian so I mentioned to see how that changes cinema more and more.
It is amazing. It's a changing. It's a very different thing. But and look this spider-man had a lot of fan service
I don't know how much I don't know what's a spoiler and what isn't
Everything is a spoiler. Okay. I liked it it you know for somebody who's grew up with
Spider-man's of years gone by it was good
Good action scenes and it seems like they did the typical thing. I can't give a spot. Okay, it's okay
Just say you like it was fine
(upbeat music)
- So I thought we'd wrap up the year
with our tech retrospective.
What your favorite product, app or service was for the year?
It doesn't necessarily have to be something
that was released this year,
but something that made a difference.
- This was tough.
This was really tough.
I love the idea of the question,
but it's so tough because all I can think of
is like the last three weeks.
You know, like that's immediately where my brain went.
It was just like, oh, what have I been using
the last four hours?
And then it was, oh wait, no, the whole year, shoot.
Okay.
So I picked three things, right?
'Cause I think that's how we were supposed to do.
- Your favorite, your one favorite thing.
Here's three.
- My one favorite thing usually comes in sets of three.
My favorite set of three things.
We'll go with that.
Is this descending or ascending order?
No order and I'm probably going to, this is the kind of question where I'm going to say
three things and then somebody's going to say, what about that?
Oh, damn, that would have made, that should have been on the list.
So I'm just going to go with, so the first one I'm going to pick is big surprise to everyone,
Craft, the app.
Mainly because I've been using it the entire year
and I still use it every single day.
So clearly I must have some kind of affinity for this app.
It's great.
I use it a lot.
That's it.
That's all I'll say about it.
I'll spare you all on that one.
- It is a great app
and it's made our Hemispheric Newsletter possible.
One prime plus.
Check it out as we enter the new year if you haven't before.
So thank you, Craft.
- Yeah, next year, season two?
No, episode.
- Volume two, season two, whatever.
- That's the word I'm looking for.
Volume two of the newsletter, dropping January 10th.
The next favorite product/app/thing would be
probably the best bang for your buck, oneprimeplus.com.
- It's got my vote.
- The next one would be the PS5.
I'm gonna go PS5.
I don't have an Xbox Series X, can't get one, not possible.
Somehow I've managed to get a PS5.
It's just really good.
It really feels like the next gen,
even though now it's like two years old,
and people still can't get them, which is insane.
But it actually was one of the first times
it felt like it was actually next gen.
Every year it's like, oh, next gen console.
It's like, yeah, I mean, kinda,
it's a little bit different.
This one really, it cranks out the pixels
And it's really, really nice and does a great job of feeling fresh and new in terms of not
just graphics, but the controller redesign with the, I think they're called adaptive
triggers.
Kind of one of the first things that's really changed in a controller in a while.
It's not a huge thing, but nor do I think controllers need to drastically change, but
the adaptive triggers are a pretty cool feature.
And then, so that was three.
So my fourth one is my Ubiquity home network
that I've been slowly building throughout the year,
which I absolutely love.
No one in their right mind needs any of this crap
in their home.
But when something excites you and you have fun with it,
why not go with it?
So I have a basically enterprise grade network
running through my home.
It's fun.
- And we can see it whenever you upload your audio
editing this podcast because it doesn't matter how big that file is, it is there.
Instantly.
Can you actually have it under zero seconds? Because I think that's how fast it is.
I think it actually arrives before I even drag and drop.
Just remember you're only as strong as the weakest link.
Gong net.
Yeah.
So, I-
Still better than it was.
I think those are my top four, not top four, just four things that were my favourites throughout
the year. And I'm sure there'll be 100 more as soon as we end this call. I will say, damn it.
But there you go. That's why we have a Discord. Passing it off to, let me flip a coin. I don't
have a coin. Martin. Okay. So, although I would say the most useful or most used products that
I have throughout the year, my iPhone and Mac, considering they're relatively new, 12 mini and
an M1 Mac mini. I'm going to give a very special mention and the top tech product for 2021 for me
personally. I know it's predictable, it's an Apple product, but funnily enough it's the 11-inch iPad
Pro, the very size that Jason has gotten rid of because although I'm tempted by an iPad mini,
as I think we've all been and Jason succumbed, the 11-inch iPad Pro, since I jumped on that,
got the new second-gen pencil and also the white Magic keyboard with it, I have been so impressed
by how much it has changed various aspects of my computing
or enhanced it.
It really has become in the laptop setting,
a computer away from my computer, perfect for writing,
perfect for getting actual work done,
whether in split view or with slide over
or just, you know, monotasking with one app on the screen.
I do quite like the size, that little middle ground
of it being between the big one and the small one
'cause I do read books on it.
I typically have the two page set up on it.
It's nice for movies, the speakers are fantastic,
but it's those little ways that it's made tasks
that I do all the time better.
Like I edit when it's my turn, 'cause Andrew and I alternate,
the way I edit the podcast on it,
having that little bit of extra screen space,
the speed at which it exports and does things,
it is an absolute dream.
And I would say has actually made the experience
of editing this podcast better.
And the addition of a track pad with the magic keyboard
makes it faster as well, moving around different things
and deleting certain ranges.
And look, I could go on forever,
but something that I've tried,
which was probably more unexpected for me,
and this is more recently in the last week or so,
I've actually given Xbox a game pass ago on the iPad
with my SteelSeries Nimbus controller.
I don't know if I'll keep it.
It's a $1 trial month thing from Microsoft.
Now I don't own an Xbox, right?
I don't own a console.
So all that stuff about download to your console
or buy this game, I'm not doing.
I've just purely gone on for the beta or beta experience
of the cloud gaming.
I have never been so impressed
with something streamed over the internet in my life.
- It makes no sense how that's possible.
- It's unbelievable.
And they're like, "Oh, when you quit, how did it go?
"Give us your feedback.
"Was the user interface okay?"
And I'm thinking this was flawless.
Like you have just loaded up all of original Halo
or like one of the Wolfenstein things or Forza Horizon.
I've tried all these different things
and it has been absolutely flawless in real time, no delay.
And I went, I never would have thought
that my iPad would be a proper gaming console.
And look, I mean, Microsoft's had to do some strange stuff
to make it work because of App Store rules and things,
but you add to your home screen,
it basically launches within like a stripped down version
of Safari and it's unbelievable.
So as a productivity editing gaming machine
with help from other companies in this case,
The iPad Pro 11 inch gets my vote, M1.
- So yeah, Martin asked for our favorite product,
app or service, our one favorite.
I've got a list of six.
- Oh, I want two more, this is unfair.
- But one of them is a gag.
Okay, the first one, gaming PC.
Okay, second one.
Second one's craft, a bit like Jason.
I don't love it as much as Jason,
but it has stuck better than many other apps I've tried.
I just had a Dynalist Pro subscription expire on me.
I thought, "No, I'm not going to use it."
Kraft, for better or worse, it gets used.
So well done, Kraft.
Next one, a bit out of left field, chess.com.
So I've been playing chess with my brother.
He defeats me virtually every time.
Yeah, he's better than me, but I play other people.
Now, Hannah has started to get into chess as well,
and she's starting to learn how to play.
It's sneaky good because you just two minutes,
you make your moves on your active games.
And generally, you know, we like to set up.
So you have 24 hours between each move.
So there's no rush.
You just make a move, put it away
and think about it again later.
But when you're with the subscription,
it also sort of gives you tutorials and training
and lets you review your games.
So you can say, ah, where did I mess up?
Where should I have played and all that kind of stuff.
I'm no deep blue, but it's a fun game, chess.
- Shallow blue.
- Yeah, very shallow.
I think there could be a future in the game of chess though.
I think that might actually be a board game going somewhere.
- It might catch on.
- Could do.
Next one, another service, Fastmail.
It just works.
It just keeps plugging away, doing its thing.
I really like their app these days.
I generally prefer their fast mail app to a native mail client, and I've never been
able to say that before.
All through the Gmail era, I always used mail apps.
They've nailed their web app.
It's a great example of a service that I didn't even think of because I don't have to.
Yeah, yeah.
And it's just infrastructure, right?
But it works.
It's not, "Oh, AWS went down."
Like, no, it's just fine.
And for anyone who missed it, people should go back to episode 42.
Yes.
Rob from Fastmail.
Alongside Fastmail, I use Sanebox.
Sanebox is kind of really kind of good because it just filters out all those.
Sanebox. It's really kind of good.
It just gets rid of all those not important, not urgent emails and just shuffles them off into a
a later folder.
And yes, I know you can set that up with rules
and blah, blah, blah.
I don't think I've got time for that.
So I don't like to be,
I like it to know that when something hits my inbox,
it's kind of important.
Like it's like almost iMessage level importance
and everything else can just wait till I've got time
and Sandbox does that well.
Last one, another service,
I had to give a shout out to it, Microdot blog.
It's where we all met.
It's very important.
And I was looking back and it's sneaky because I look now and it's got
years and years of like my blogging life on it at this point.
And so, it's actually quite a significant part of my online life these days.
But it still doesn't hold you captive.
You can take it elsewhere.
So.
I just looked and next month I've been on that thing for four years.
Wow.
I had no idea. I would have guessed two.
lots of friends there. Yeah, definitely. I meet new people there all the time.
Oh, also, so that just, you just reminded me I would,
I would add discord to my list because that's been wonderful this year for me.
Anyway,
after I finally got rid of the 900 different discords that I was a part of
because I, you know, it was like, Oh, add, add, add. And it was like, what,
what am I doing? Stop. That's insane. So the discord for this, for this,
group, whatever you want to call it, has been great.
Really great people in there.
It's not super overwhelming.
Sometimes it gets a little insane, but it's like totally fine to just come and go.
So yeah.
Easy to meet a channel, find something that you like.
Yeah.
It's been really good.
I've gotten a lot more enjoyment out of it than I ever did in any of the slacks that
I was a part of.
And I guess that doesn't really have anything to do with the platform.
just maybe this one stuck better for me.
- So I think you've both segued us accidentally
to a perfect ending with Microduplog and Discord.
I personally, and I'm sure you both agree,
would like to thank every single listener,
every hemispherian, whether you just listen to the free show
or also join OnePrimePlus,
thank you very much for your awesome support,
not just for 2021, but I think since we started.
I didn't know for sure if we would make it this long,
but it's probably one of the most fun things that I do.
So thank you everyone.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to each and every one of you.
I hope you have all enjoyed the last episode.
For 2021.
Oh, thank goodness.
And now let's take it out with a song.
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Come on boys.
Oh
We had some Christmas garden lights little Santa heads that light up at nighttime solar panel things
They charge during the day light up at night. Yeah, they melted yesterday
[laughter]
There's nothing that says "Merry Christmas" more than a melted, deformed Santa head on a stick.
It was hot!
