So I'm looking at notes today and there's deceivingly it says six things but each of the numbers has about 40 bullets underneath it so I'm gonna just assume that we're not going to get to all of this today is that a fair assumption.
We can be efficient well I can't I can but.
Well Martin's part will be fast and then ours will not be.
[Music]
Is there anywhere that you all would like to start in the grand grab bag of topics?
Can we get the messy thing that everybody else is talking about out of the way first or should we save it?
That's Elon Musk.
Let's do it now make it quick.
I don't care next people are mad it's exactly the same as it always has been and it will continue to be the exact same place that it's always been nothing will change.
He'll get bored sell it or leave in a year.
Done you have no skin invested in this game do you know I haven't been on Twitter in many many years so it's it's one of those things that I can truly say.
I don't care. I think it's unfortunate that the platform has as much power as it does in the world.
How do you both feel about it? Are you on the rage quit boat on the way out of there? Or do you
have different opinions?
No, I'm not on the rage quit bandwagon, at least at this stage. I understand that Elon's not
everyone's favorite guy, although he is some people's favorite guy. So take that as you will.
I actually have and have always had a very positive Twitter experience. I understand that in the Trump
years it particularly wasn't great and that lots of people misuse it and that there's online abuse
there like just about any network it needs to be fixed. But I've never really seen many issues in
my own feed. I don't have a huge number of people I follow from very news or political spheres. I
have mainly friends, fellow podcast fans and maybe a lot of academic connections from my uni stuff
who are there. So I go in there, I see useful and funny things, and then I leave.
And when the whole thing about Musk came along, I thought, "Okay, well,
you know, I'm not obsessed with this guy. I think he's the best, but I don't necessarily think the
company's been managed super well. I certainly don't like all the ad stuff. That's why I use
an app like Tweetbot to keep things chronological and ad-free. So perhaps going private is a good
thing maybe it'll be a shake up maybe he's the best guy maybe he's not i'm cautiously optimistic
that something really useful will happen and that it will change for the better and if it doesn't
then i'll leave but i think a lot of people rage quitting could take maybe five minutes
see how it goes and then decide to leave if they don't like it and i'm not trying to avoid saying
anything controversial here it's just i don't know people have views about mask and that's
the biggest reason what he's done but let's just wait and see what he does yeah it's not
Nothing has happened so what's the point in taking an action and it just seems like you're taking an action based on nothing if you want to leave leave go for it if this is what it was needed for somebody to get out of something that was not good for them perfect.
Well look I've already rage quit twitter I've rage quit twitter once once before I lost my username my at canyon username got consigned to the dustbin of history.
You should quit again so you can return and become Andrew Canyon 55 or something.
This is my second attempt at Twitter with my @andrewcanyon. Bill O' Martin, I don't really have any other problems that people talk about with Twitter because,
really it's just a basketball forum for me and that was a concerted decision I made on returning to the platform. I thought I'm not going to go the,
all topics to all man approach this time. I'm going to be super focused and I'm going to use it just for my,
NBL basketball which has worked out really nicely and similar to Martin. He uses tweetbot. I
Use Twitter if ik after using tweetbot for a while
I switched over to Twitter if ik and bought that subscription very rarely use the actual official app because it's a so I couldn't use
Twitter full-time if that was my experience
It's worse than the Instagram for ads
So I don't get any of that with Twitter if ik and it's the only way to live
But even still I mean I can't stand Elon Musk. I think he's so
Frustrating the way that he is so willing and able to just flaunt any
Rules that are put for him with like the SEC and those sorts of things the amount of trading violations
He's been guilty of he's a massive pump and dumper of stocks
He's and he's childish as well like the fact the way with the price of Twitter
He started off it was he ended up with the price of fifty four twenty getting in the 420 reference
Which is like the the marijuana call sign in America. I think for police
And it's like he had to get that 420 in because he's such a dope fan. It's just like so childish
And it just seems to me annoying that somebody who's so pathetic on so many levels has so much money and power and
Admiration and adulation. I think he's just not worth it and now that he's gonna have this platform
I worry for the future of the platform because he's gonna think that he's the smartest guy in the room and we'll try and fix it
And I'm not sure that his attempts to fix it will be any better than what they have tried already and in fact
I think it'll make it worse, so I'm hanging with Twitter for the moment, but I've got discord instances cranked up
NBL is slowly moving to a discord instance, and I'm using Twitter a little bit less already, but I'm still there
YouTube premium
Do either of you have it I did at one point, and I don't any longer
I can't believe it's so expensive, but I still have it.
For the purposes of sanity.
Yeah, I added this to the notes because I thought at least one of you would have it.
I only just signed up for it because I looked at it for the longest time and I thought,
I'm not going to use this offline stuff very much.
I certainly already have Apple Music and I'm not going to browse YouTube for my music.
But my goodness, how many ads have I seen for Subway,
Southern style chicken on a footlong on my TV I became so enraged every time I
wanted to watch a YouTube video I thought I have to I have to give them
money to stop this I cannot bear this anymore.
Isn't that the worst part? Where it's not even that it's ads it's that it's the
same stupid ad 50,000 times in a row and all I can think is that's on purpose
that they know either people will suffer through it or they will say take my
money I don't want to see this stupid shampoo ad for the 75th time today.
But it's two ads at the beginning and then two ads in the middle of a
relatively short video so we've complained about ads before but I
thought for anyone else who's out there and is using YouTube and maybe we just
wasn't aware of YouTube premium or was thinking is it worth it? It is expensive
as Andrew said but I just wanted to say I've taken the plunge and just over the
past week or whatever that I've had it it's significantly improved my existence
because one of the things that I've noticed in TV viewing since we no longer really use a plug-in
TV aerial or what is it coaxial cable in the wall everything's pretty much filtered through Apple TV
and I like it that way but I'm finding increasingly I'm sitting down using the YouTube app to browse
various subscriptions and channels that I that I follow and the ads for these videos are worse
to my recollection than any broadcast ad breaks that I had to sit through when I was a kid and
And I thought, I can't believe that we have this internet capability and I have to sit
through this.
So yeah, turning that whinge into a positive, if you want to avoid ads in your life, just
even if it's begrudgingly, give money to Google, improve your life and know that when you hit
that little Apple TV selection button or use anything else on another device, the video
that you requested will actually appear in front of your face and not Subway's Southern
Style Chicken Sub.
Yeah I found when buying it was a case of I'm buying back my time and the time of my family as well because how much is that time worth and frustration and annoyance that we just want to quickly see how to fix my pool filter,
I don't want to have to watch three ads before I do that because I'm standing outside the shed getting frustrated don't frustrate me more but Martin the other thing I need to give you a word of warning okay so you need to prepare yourself because,
Over time you want to buy a family pack of Google premium YouTube premium you just want to look you think it's the single user things expensive try looking at the family pack it's ridiculous so what you do is you realize when Mac wants to watch videos.
Just use my account okay I got two kids.
Do you know what happens to you YouTube algorithm when you get to kids stuff pumped in.
That's not good.
And whenever the presenter says like an excribe they do it so your subscriptions.
Oh.
I basically rendered meaningless okay I have to scroll so far down to find like where's my Perth Wildcats press conference subscription thing.
Because it's very under pages and pages of roblox and.
Even game or TV and all these sorts of things it's a disaster but I'm also not going to pay extra money to Google they can get one subscription and I'm willing to suffer the pain because also my children I don't want them getting brainwashed by bazillion ads.
And I appreciate the experience as well so just a word of warning brace yourself enjoy it whilst pure.
Yeah, I think the way I use YouTube, I don't really browse it very often, if at all.
I have a lot of subscriptions in YouTube which all feed into YouTube DL for me that then
download, put the thumbnail on, and throw it into Plex.
So when I want to go watch any of my "YouTube videos," it's just all within Plex.
There's no ads or anything in there because it's just the video and it pulls whatever
is the highest quality version that they've uploaded.
So in that sense, that's why I stopped YouTube premium.
I used to have it, but after I realized all I'm really doing is looking at stuff that
I'm subscribing to in Plex anyway, and I had premium just on the off chance that I viewed
a video, I didn't want to see ads, that didn't become worth the $14.99 or whatever it is
a month.
But in the other two ways that you guys are using it, I can see that being a value.
If you don't want to do a stupid nerdy setup of having this whole server run with YouTube
DL and download stuff and transcode into Plex and all that crap, you just want to open the
YouTube app and not see an ad, then yeah.
who are a part of the One Prime Plus Club, they recently got another episode and it was
excellent. It was 18 minutes, maybe 53 seconds, I can't quite remember.
1818. Deliberate.
It's so much fun. One Prime Plus, you'll hear things that are probably not necessarily appropriate
for the main feed. You're getting slightly different content. You're getting, I wouldn't
say it's a higher quality of content. I don't want to go so far as to say that.
It's a different brand.
Is it fair to take that old Big Brother kind of brand name and call it like HV Uncut or
now that's probably a little bit too explicit.
I will give you a line from one of my favorite movies of all time and see if you can get
it you won't because it's obscure.
It's a different brand.
It's a different quality of product.
Now do I tell you or do I just leave it in the ether and let people play a game.
I think you just leave it and then there's going to be like 1.6 people out there that
are like oh that's that one movie Avatar.
All right someone gets a prize if they get it is that right.
Andrew will send them a burned copy with Sharpie written on it of that said film because it's probably public domain.
I love the HomePod. I'm so glad I bought a HomePod. I wish I'd bought more of them.
Which one?
Original. Because when you listen to the HomePod versus the HomePod Mini, oh my goodness, the sound between the two of them, it's night and day.
And I look at the HomePod Mini and I think, "You little guy, you suck."
That's a bit strong.
And I go back to the HomePod and I invoke our digital assistant on the big one and she thinks
and waits and goes slow. And I think, "You sound good, but you're very slow. I wish there was a
new version of you." There's all this rumour stuff about like a soundbar version, which has
merged with the Apple TV to make this HomeKit hub with a centre stage camera and blah, blah, blah.
Sounds great and interesting. I mean, there's other questions about putting cameras in the
in the living room and having it attached to a screen
and the idea of an Orwellian big brother and so on,
mild caution about that one.
My kind of angle about it was more about a word family.
I was thinking about in the Steve Jobs days,
if we think about another product called Pod, like an iPod,
something you heard frequently in keynote presentations
was the iPod family.
There was a range of different devices
Apple's iPod family was successful because it broke beyond this initial white product
that only connected to a Mac through Firewire and became this suite of big screen and small screen
and no screen devices that fit different use cases and preferences. And I know that we're
dealing with a much more different, much larger Apple now, but I look at that HomePod product
that they released, which I love and have in that stereo pair in my lounge room right now,
And I think, did you actually give it enough time
to extend it?
And then Andrew, you brought up the HomePod mini,
which seems like a family building product,
but was given that moniker
as they were removing the big one.
So it's a mini of a thing that doesn't exist
that stands by itself.
So I wanted to know if you two agree with this,
if you have another thought,
do you think the HomePod just needed more time?
And if they had released it as a family at the beginning
and actually marketed it as kind of like AirPort was,
or the iPod was, or now the iPhone with multiple models,
that it would have been more successful.
They put too much stuff into that one early thing
and thought this is gonna be big.
- It was the worst time of Apple when they had the whole,
they were doing the butterfly keyboards
and they were trying to supply chain efficiency
the whole thing.
- Yeah.
- And it would just seem like they wanted to minimize
their skews so much that if something wasn't a blow away hit
as Tim Cook would probably call it,
They just ditched it.
And I think if they had their time over again, or if the management team was different, they
would keep it and they would reinvest in it and make it a better thing and give it more
time.
So the current Apple, I think, would have a do-over.
I think that Apple stuffed up massively.
And so I hope that they are willing to sort of put the tail between the legs and re-release
a HomePod 2, a big guy, because I think now they are starting to realize, "Oh, this thing
at is actually pretty good and it is fairly unique in the market and there's a loyal cadre
of buyers out there that will buy the thing.
And it may not be massive but like you say as a family you have the HomePod Bar, you
have the HomePod Normal, you have the HomePod Mini, you have the HomePod Portable, they
can chuck batteries in it and compete with Logitech or whatever.
I think they need to find more growth avenues.
I mean, at the moment we saw their results come through and it's all services growth.
And that's mathematically natural that it would happen because we're all subscribing to things.
But they don't have any new growth avenues and the stock market won't appreciate that.
I think there's like a few different issues that I think got us to where we're at.
One is that the marketplace in general, the bar is set at good enough.
So when you look at the other things that it's quote competing with good
enough is going to win when it's $49 or whatever.
So I think the price was one thing that was potentially an issue given that it
was, was it three 99?
It was 500 in Australia.
Oh, so even more. Okay. But yeah.
So I think the price was,
was something where regardless of what it was,
people are going to fall back to why is this 500 and this is $49.
So that's one thing.
The other piece is that it's so heavily reliant on an entire other technology
being Siri, which hasn't had the strongest of, I guess, support, I could say from
users.
So when you, when you have this $500 thing and you're saying you could only deal
with it via this other thing that maybe you're not so hot on to begin with.
That's not super great for it. And I think the other piece is,
um, it's an audio product for your home, which I don't think,
and I could be completely wrong,
but I don't know if that's really that important of a product to most consumers.
The, the, it's, if you take like a,
a hierarchy of importance to a person,
probably phone mobile device in your pocket is going to be way up at the top, then maybe
something like an iPad or a computer, then you have this audio only, all it does is audio device.
I just don't think that's that high of a priority for almost all consumers.
If they could make a new HomePod, a new HomePod Maxi that had a couple of audio inputs,
Just to enable it to plug better into a system, keep basically the sound profiles.
I don't care. You don't need to add equalizers. Maybe it's something in software, but I don't
really care. But just make it a little bit more integrated so that it's not a dead-end product.
Like, because now, if anything goes wrong with it, or if Siri changes, or if they stop updating
software, it's dead. It will stop working. And that's the biggest problem with it.
I would not at all be surprised to see the big HomePod come back as a HomePod studio, right?
Given all the things that are going on right now. So I think a HomePod studio makes a lot of sense
as like a monitor, you know, you have the big monitor speakers on your desk or whatever.
I could see that being a thing.
I get sad for my HomePod every time I look at it because I feel like it's on death row.
And I love it so much. And I don't want to use it more than I think I should just because I want
to use it while it works. And that's a sad indictment on the whole situation, I think.
I fully expect there to be something that I will want to replace it with before it stops working.
Given how long I've had laptops and iPads that just keep going, I don't think there's an issue.
Had the Mini come out and been that thing like the kind of airplay to around the house or
semi-portable Sonos equivalent thing that you could just put in any room, cool. But then the
HomePod had actually been marketed as more of an accessible, cable-free home theatre alternative.
it would have been a very different story because the way I have it set up is with stereo pair
connected to an Apple TV. And that's how I've had it since I moved into this place. And I've
sent a lot of things online from people who went, "Oh, wow, it actually sounds cool as a stereo
pair." They didn't really click. They thought this is too expensive. I'm just going to stick
with the one and then discovered it after the fact. If Apple had, and they're never going to
do this, but if they had sold a bundle or a box that had two HomePods and an Apple TV and market
at it, not as a kind of standalone Apple Music thing,
but here is an entire home theater in a box
that costs a fraction of that gigantic amplifier thing
with cables.
I reckon people would have flocked to buy it.
- Yeah, even if it wasn't a physical bundle,
just a display that's saying like, here's what you-
- They had rooms for them.
- Yeah, exactly.
'Cause like, they'll never do a bundle
in the traditional bundle sense.
That's not their thing.
But I could see that being a little section in the store
of the two speakers, the Apple TV,
and then all that crap right underneath.
So you just scoop it up, give them $50,000 and leave.
(upbeat music)
Media Corner.
There was a whole era where backtracking was considered this work of the devil.
Wasn't that the satanic panic?
Yes.
Yeah. And one of my- one of the songs I really liked as a child was Another One Bites the Dust, which is one of the very famous ones for having it.
Because if you listen to that backwards, it says, it's fun to smoke marijuana.
So, I know what you're talking about now.
When you- sorry, when you said backtracking, I was like, what, just going back to hear what you said.
Yeah, it was much more difficult when you had vinyl.
But it was, uh, if you played it backwards, certain songs would have other lyrics
masked and it was the work of the devil.
So there you go, everybody.
That's the first bit of media corner taken care of.
New game on Nintendo switch called Kirby.
Not the full title, but.
Benjamin became addicted to the Kirby demo that we downloaded for him.
And he played that over and over probably 10 times.
Just playing that demo.
He played like played through the whole demo multiple times.
Wow.
He loved it so much.
I thought I have to get this so I bought the game. I was so excited
He saw it and he was so he was so excited that he was blown away, but then he didn't want to waste it
So he said I think that that's amazing. But I think I'll just keep playing the demo. I finally convinced him
That's okay. You can play the real game and you won't use it up
You know, it's there's enough content there that you'll keep going and I think he just knew where he was at with the demo
He knew how to play it. He was really good at it
Got in the full game. He played that for a day or two and hasn't touched it since I played it
I think it's really fun
I'm not much of a gamer in terms of platform games, but it reminds me of the Mario
Whatever the Mario 3d world games are the more recent Odyssey
It's really cool really fun and not too difficult and it has difficulty settings, which is awesome for somebody like me
Well, it's two-player too, right? So couldn't you guys play it together?
I couldn't be bothered at the time, but I need to probably pull that out and try to player
Yeah, there's a co-op mode so you can both do it together and then if he's not feeling it you can have him do the
Easy part. Yeah, and you do that. Maybe that's a Russian part
Because I saw that and thinking he's gonna want to be Kirby this Kirby. He's cute. He's pink
He's a giant mouth. Although I'm saying he Benjamin is convinced that Kirby is a she from day dot
He's been referring to her as a as a she who am I to argue?
So Kirby on Nintendo switch get around it. It's a good game
Well I can I can second that it is a very very good game.
I am unable to second or third that but I trust you.
What's next?
A TV series that was recommended to us through the discord hemisphere views discord.
There's so much recommendations flying through that discord channel the media corner discord channel but yeah there's a lot of a lot of stuff goes through there and my list just keeps growing and it's it's I love it but it's like I'm running out of time here.
The one I saw recommended was a show called upright and the reason it jumped out at me is because it's an Australian show it features Tim Minchin.
You may be known to people and some of the filming was in Perth so I thought well I gotta get around this and see what's going on.
Anything with Perth and you're in.
Yeah that's the problem whenever you see a TV show that's filmed in Perth you spend your whole time not watching the show but trying to figure out exactly where the filming location was.
What was it about a road trip across Australia isn't it so that's the destination.
And they travel across the number me interesting characters on the way all in in an effort to mention character lucky is trying to get a piano back to home.
While his mother is rapidly dying.
He's driving the piano all the way across.
Any and then he he he teams up with a young girl who's also trying to get across the country it's a really fun show every episode has hijinks it's got good Australian humor it's a good Australian music in it it's heartwarming but thoughtful.
Really good show and I think it's been renewed for a season 2 so I don't know how they'll build on because it seemed to wrap up quite neatly but they seem to have plans for season 2.
I have two questions then with upright a how many times did the phrase old mate come up if at all as I'm sure you were counting and also was it very clear that they were getting closer to Perth as they were going throughout the episodes because the occurrences of high viz increased throughout the entire show.
I think there might have been an old mate. I think there might be to be one, perhaps.
Right. In terms of high viz, there was a lot of high viz through the show.
And I would argue that, yes, it probably did increase because there was an episode around the Kalgoorlie area.
And there was high viz, definite high viz there, and Kalgoorlie is part of Western Australia.
They have some big holes there.
Mm, they do.
So I think, yes, high viz occurrences did increase as we reached WA.
So checks out it's true to true itself true to Australia
Oh
And the other one other thing about the show and I mentioned this in the discord
Is that one of the actors that turned up in one of the episodes? Yeah, I've met and spoken to a number of times. So
checks out in terms of
Just Perth. Well, it's just Perth people everybody in Perth knows everybody but by maybe one or two
degrees of separation. So again, checks out. Do you think Nick Tan knows him too? Oh, absolutely.
Yeah. Yeah. Nick Tan knows, Nick Tan knows everybody. He gets them all in the hot tub tan
machine. But even if people don't watch upright, they should definitely look into Tim Minchin in
general and particularly a song about Sam's mum. I'll let people look that up. Or they could just
click on the entry in the show notes because our show notes are the best show notes. That's where
I would go. Better show notes. Whenever you hear a show that says, "Oh, you'll find it in the show
notes," and you look in the show notes and it's not actually there, no mention of it whatsoever,
you'll never have that problem with hemispheric views. Best show notes in the business,
underappreciated, underrecognized. We deserve more credit.
I don't feel like anyone probably ever looks at them, but I like to think that they do.
Well, my movie recommendation has the title, which actually is a perfect description of our
show notes, and that is "Everything, Everywhere, All at Once." All right?
Tied to show that it's a guy it's like there was anything we're good at it's tie ins.
That's right anyway I'm not going to bang on about this movie and spoil things have either of you to seen it.
No I have not seen it yet I have not seen it but I think I want to say it.
Well can I tell you Natasha and I went to see that the movies we had a Mac free evening he was under the care of very generous relatives and this movie is excellent it's creative.
it has a great diverse cast. For anyone who doesn't know what it is, everything, everywhere,
all at once, I'm not going to spoil it. This is just the basic premise. It's a movie about
the multiverse. So, we're talking about parallel or fragmenting or interconnected universes based on
different decisions that you make or turning points in your life or happenings, right?
In a broad sense. And the story is simply about a woman, a Chinese-American woman who
operates a laundromat with her family. She's being investigated by the IRS because she
incorrectly filed her taxes. And in the procedure of visiting the IRS, she has a kind of multiverse
experience which reveals the true nature of the universe or universes to her and she has to solve
a problem. It's creative. It kind of has this feel that borrows simultaneously from the kind of,
I suppose, Chinese or Kung Fu borrowings of The Matrix filtered back into a movie with Asian
actors in it, which is great. But it also borrows, and again, universes are different from dreams,
but the kind of layering or simultaneous effects of Inception, it's sci-fi, it's comedy, it's family
drama, it's all smooshed together, the music's great. And the whole thing is kind of tongue in
cheek and ridiculous. So, if you're looking for a movie that's fun, action packed, takes itself
seriously, but also doesn't take itself seriously, this is an awesome movie.
I have a question. Everybody that has been talking about this movie, there's kind of one
theme that I keep hearing and that is, if you're ever going to go see a movie in a theatre,
this is the one you should do. So, I'm going to... Okay. So, clearly, another plus one.
I'm not going to a theatre. Sorry, it's not happening. I'm going to watch this at home
in my home theatre. What am I going to... Do you think it's going to be that different of
an experience or is it just going to be different? Look, I think when people say that they're
obviously talking about the size of the screen and that whole thing. Sure, you don't have to have
that. But I think my point would be that it is a movie that you want to be highly invested in,
turn the lights off and not have interruptions or be checking your phone while you're watching it.
That's the message.
That's all movies at our house, for sure. There's no casual watch. If we're watching a movie,
we're watching a movie. I just couldn't stop thinking that everybody kept saying this because
it's been two and a half years since anybody has seen a movie outside of their home. And most
people don't, like, go all in on a home theatre crazy system. So, it was like, to see a movie in
the theatre was just epic anyway. So, I was just curious if it really has something to do with
this movie, or it's just like, people were super excited to see a movie in the theatre again,
that had like, proper sound and lighting and all that stuff.
Look, I mean, I'm really glad that I went to a cinema to see it because I think it's,
the sound was very cool. The music's interesting, and it's really a visual spectacle. And
when you look at this multiverse or these various universes that explores,
they have different looks or because of the decisions that have led to their existence,
there's a different style to each of them. So, having that size on the screen
really immerses you perhaps a bit more. But yeah, as long as you have a distraction for
for environment, it's cool.
If you watch it at home on your OLED, watch a Mahouzit with your fancy pods.
Still good, I'm assuming.
Absolutely. Yeah.
OK. I just want to ask, does it mess with your head, the way Inception messes with your head?
But do you get caught up with multiverses and timelines and all those sorts of things?
I wouldn't say in a way that disturbs you or if you pay attention and you have no
distraction, as I said, you can follow it and it all makes sense.
So, it's not out to trip you up or make you feel stupid, but it does make you think in the sense of,
"If I had done that thing differently in my life, what would it be like now?"
It actually makes you think quite reflexively or personally.
More like sliding doors than Inception, perhaps.
Oh, well, yeah, but that's another thing.
So, I say Inception because of the presentation of simultaneous elements, but sliding doors is a perfect example in terms of what if I had done that?
I'm more interested in it now than I was before because I hadn't read much about it because I didn't want to spoil myself but I had the impression that it was more like a superhero kind of movie somehow.
It's not that.
There's elements to that too I suppose but not in the Marvel sense no not like that.
No it's it's multiverse not Marvel Cinematic Universe different.
Yes I think I think that actually does trip me up.
Not to mention a bigger word nowadays is probably metaverse. We don't hear the end of that. So there's all kinds of connotations flying around.
Yeah, it's not metaverse and it's not Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's multiverse, just like multi-pass from Fifth Element, but a multiverse.
Also, I did have several people tell me do not watch the trailer because it does not do it. It doesn't make you want to see the movie. So I've just kind of avoided the trailer as well.
It's such a big concept for a movie that to shoehorn it into a minute is unfair and to show it at three minutes gives away too much, but then still doesn't give you a vibe.
You know what I mean? So, just see it.
Don't ruin it for yourself.
You can check back in and tell me if you liked it.
I've added it to the Apple TV queue thing, so it'll tell us when it's available to rent or buy or whatever.
I guess that's me now.
I've got two.
I'll go quick.
like Andrew, uh, the first one was an involuntary movie watch called
Midnight in Paris from 2011 starring, uh, it's a Woody Allen movie.
If anyone cares about that, um, starring Owen Wilson.
I mean, what more do you need than that?
Woody Allen and Owen Wilson.
It was, have either of you seen this first of all?
No.
Yeah.
It's very, very weird. It was, uh, it was the kind of movie that's recommended to you because the
person somewhat misremembered what the actual movie was actually like. So when they were sitting
there with you watching it, it was kind of a, this is not how I remember this going. So it was, uh,
I kind of liked the premise of it. Honestly, I don't, I didn't really have a strong affinity for
anyone in it per se. And I don't, Woody Allen means nothing. I don't, I'm not like,
"Oh, Woody Allen movies are the best," or "Oh, I can't stand it." I don't care. It's what,
he's somebody, he's a person, he directed it. Great. But I kind of, I almost want to recommend
it to people to watch purely just based on the premise. I thought it was kind of a cool premise.
And seeing, if you're very into writing, literature, art, history, I think it would
would mean a lot more to you knowing who all of these characters are and kind of
having this romanticized view of what they're like having obviously never met
them. And now you're kind of meeting them in this movie.
So I won't say much more than that, but it was a, it was an interesting movie.
It's definitely one that I never would have watched just on my own if it had
come up on Netflix or whatever your streaming service of choices,
but I'm kind of glad that I saw it even though it was very weird.
So, I would- - I kind of feel like Martin would like it.
I think he would be really into it.
It might not be enough.
Might not be an arthouse enough for Martin, actually.
That's the thing. I think it might be a little too pedestrian for him.
A bit too pandering to Hollywood.
But I think the idea.
Yeah, I think so.
It's like they're writing it for like you and I, when really they should have written it for him and it would have like landed so well.
Just backtracking a few seconds.
Yes, go ahead, Satan.
My favourite thing is how you said, it's a weird movie.
I think Martin would really like it.
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
I think you would.
Martin is weird.
Yeah. Oh, I mean, that's, this is what, episode 57?
I think we're fully aligned on that.
Right. That seems clear to everyone.
So yeah, Midnight in Paris.
Check it out.
And the next one I have, doubly quick, quicker than Midnight in Paris, is a game.
I'm going to bring a game into this to fully bookend this with Kirby.
Tiny room stories, colon town mystery.
It is a, I would call it a procedural escape room.
I don't know if that's really accurate, but it's a story, but it's set in scenes
that you can't leave and it's, it's like an escape room where you're, you're
spinning the scene around to sequentially discover things to pass that section. So you
need to maybe spin a room around to find out that behind a book there's a key that you
need to get into this other room. So it's that kind of puzzle procedural discovery thing.
And if you like that, I think it's, it's, it's a fun little game and you can kind of
do one scene, leave, come back to another scene. So you don't have to really play the
whole game all in one go.
Yeah, it's on the iPad, it's on Steam, and maybe a few other places.
I think it's on Android as well.
I initially downloaded it on Steam to play it on my Mac, and there's some bug where it
said I beat the game when I installed it, and I got all the achievements just as soon
as I launched it, and I can't seem to reset it.
So that now I've purchased it on the iPad as well, and I'm playing it there now instead.
Which is the better platform to play it on?
I think I prefer playing it on the computer because I think manipulating it with a mouse
I find to be better for myself versus doing it with my fingers.
It's fine.
I think it just depends on what you prefer as a game player.
Some people really love just doing it with their fingers.
I prefer the mouse, but they both work, I would say, equally well.
I have two questions.
Two questions.
One, why would you not want all achievements straight away?
Um, that's a good question.
I wouldn't care.
The problem is that the way the story is presented is it's presented as a book and
each kind of chapter flips the book.
So when you've beaten the game, you're at the end of the book and you can
cycle back. But as soon as you go to the next chapter and beat it,
you're now back at the end. So it's just,
it's jarring in the way that the flow goes. So it's just, it's just annoying.
It doesn't really ruin it, I would say, but it's just,
it's annoying because it feels like you're kind of coming in secondhand and
you're now having to figure, Oh, I got to flip all the way back to chapter three.
I beat chapter three.
Now I got to flip all the way back and you lose any sense of where the hell you are in the game.
My second question, is there a landscaping achievement?
I haven't gotten it yet, but God, there probably is in the DLC.
I would imagine.
Perfect.
Yeah.
I don't hate him.
There's a feature amongst iCloud and iOS called calls on other devices.
Do you both have this turned on?
Partly.
Yes.
I've decided that I cannot stand it and I've turned it off because I've realized almost
all of the time, all of my devices are within a very short distance from me and on the rare
chances that I'm getting phone calls, to have one, two, five devices start ringing with
with a stupid ringtone, and then to hit one of those devices
to shut it off, they might all stop, maybe not.
It is maddening.
The funniest thing about it is of all the things
that my phone could do, phone calls are the thing
I care about the absolute least.
Why am I driving myself insane having it happen
on 16,000 devices at once?
Yeah, so I turned it off and you know what?
It's so much better.
It's one of those features where you're like, "Oh, that's super cool.
Obviously, I need to have that."
You know what? No, you don't.
You really don't. Turn it off.
Totally agree.
If you need to get a phone call, pick up your phone.
Just don't stop driving yourself crazy.
Yeah, I agree.
It's really annoying.
It's anxiety inducing enough to get a phone call to begin with.
To have eight devices all start ringing, your anxiety levels just shoot through the roof.
It's one of the coolest proof of concept features to say like, "Check this out."
You get a phone call, which is this weird, not analog anymore, but this weird phone system
thing coming in, and all your other devices that don't have a phone in them ring and you
can answer.
It's like, "Oh, that's so cool and useful."
And then it's just like, "No, actually, I've got a thousand devices ringing at me at once,
and it makes me want to crawl in a hole."
Somehow it's survived being the ultimate interruption device and people put up with it. They don't put up with interruption
anywhere else. Everything else is time shifted except phone calls
somehow have this special place in people's minds that it can annoy you or interrupt you at any point in the day.
Yeah, I could see if there were some and it doesn't work unless the phone is next to them as well
which is the other piece of it, right? Where it's like, oh, well that means I could just take my iPad with me when I
leave that? No. The phone has to be within like a distance. So if it's close enough to be able to do
the call, your phone is close enough to just do it on the phone. So I don't know. I came to this
weird realization. I'm like, I don't need this and I don't think I want it. And I think I'm better
off for it. So is it fair to say this is our first ever? Hemispheric hot tip. Ooh, hot. Ooh,
Look at that. We got a new sound now. Hot tip. I don't know how that sounded, but I just had to do
it. Oh, the other day when I was staying at, um, I was at crown, I was at crown hotels for a couple
of days. It was a delayed family break because of COVID. But we had a couple of nights at the hotel
had to ring guest services. They have the most annoying hold thing ever because they promote
their own services, but the woman who's done the voiceover shouldn't say, at Crown we offer you fresh towels every day.
She says, at Crown we offer you fresh towels every day.
At Crown you can gamble your money away.
At Crown you can eat and it's expensive.
Everything you want at Crown.
It's really annoying.
That sounded really, really good and like a great reproduction until you said you can eat and it's really expensive.
The first part rhymed even like I thought you really like it's been embedded in your head.
Then you said that and I was like, oh, he's just making it up.
But good effort, I have to say.
Well, in Australia, everybody in Australia doesn't say "crown".
We say "crown".
Yeah. Welcome to Crown, Crown Resorts.
We have a Crown Street mall in Wollongong actually.
It's like our open pedestrian zone.
So from now on, I'm just gonna walk in
and just go at Crown Street Mall.
- Self-service repair, that website for self-service repair.
Oh my God, that's terrible.
- Do you engage a lot of self-service, Jason?
- I do quite often.
Yeah, three to six times a day, usually.
- Don't hurt yourself.
- Got a lot of things to repair.
- Sorry, I just realized I was swiping up and down
with my little selection thing again in craft.
In craft, you can edit together,
Collaboration with craft seems to work best with C C words
Or the Grand Canyon, right did that mean that would work tours and adventures
Yeah, I think it's that I think it's that are that second are
are really...sensitive.
