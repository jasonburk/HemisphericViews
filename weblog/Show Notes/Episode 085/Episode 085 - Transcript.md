- Welcome hemispherians.
This is a bit of an odd bonus HV mini in the feed.
You weren't expecting it.
We haven't done an HV mini in the regular feed
for a very long time, but welcome to Gaming Corner.
Are you guys excited?
- I could not be more hyped about Gaming Corner.
- Yes.
- Andrew, are you hyped?
- Yes.
- Awesome.
(laughing)
I'll believe that.
- It's like far away. - Yes, yes.
It's like down in a cave or something.
That's what it sounds like to me.
Yes, yes.
- He's on a soundboard today.
He is just a soundboard, so.
- Do another yes.
- Yes.
- See? - Awesome, peaking.
Now, jokes aside, very serious.
What time of year is it, guys?
We've got Arcadia June coming up
and we're right at the end of May.
This is absolutely imperative.
So hemispherians, a lot of you might've heard this before,
but if you're new to the Hemispheric Universe,
each June for the past couple of years,
we've done a fantastic competition
hosted mainly in the Discord
in the Arcadia June Gaming Channel,
where we all play this wonderful app full of mini games.
You can play it on the phone, the watch, the Mac,
the iPad, Apple TV, across all Apple platforms.
Wonderful developers in Italy are behind it.
But we realized that we hadn't actually discussed it yet
in any of the regular episodes.
So I went, "Oh my God, we're not gonna have one out
"until the beginning of June, this is way too late."
So this mini episode is to promote
the upcoming game competition.
And we thought, was that the soundboard again?
- Yes, sorry, I got carried away.
I love the new soundboard.
Ferrago 3, I think is what it is.
- Perfect.
So basically what we wanted to announce ahead of time,
give people a chance to get in there,
explore the mini games, and you can share your scores
in any way you like, but mainly on Discord.
That's the way we encourage you to do it.
And Jason is the leaderboard maintenance master,
just like master of the show notes.
And we thought, how can we announce it
differently this year?
Well, we thought, let's actually play at least one game
from the Arcadia app collection together.
At the same time, I think Andrew said this
in our little iMessage chat,
I feel the same way, totally out of practice.
I'm a little bit shit.
So this will be quite funny.
And what we've done quite complicated
with multi file recording is you'll hear us
playing the game together
in this mini gaming corner, HV mini episode.
But you can also see an edited video
on the Hemispheric Views YouTube channel
with each of our windows.
And I don't even know if this is gonna work
or if I'm gonna be able to do it properly,
but I'm gonna try to do it.
I'm gonna try to edit this using Final Cut Pro
for iPad.
- Yes.
- Save me guys.
- Wow.
That is like, that alone is probably the challenge, right?
I mean, the game is probably secondary to that.
- I'm terrified.
And I just made up that idea just as we started recording.
So I don't know if that's a big mistake.
- Oh no.
(laughing)
- That soundboard is paying for itself.
I'm so glad.
- It's just, it's worth every penny really.
- Now, maybe we should turn to Jason
to talk about the game that we've selected.
Which one is it?
Why would we do this one?
- Yeah, absolutely.
There are what, six, 12, 18,
there's something like 20, 25 games in there.
There's a lot.
And they're all included in the one app.
It's just one thing you get.
It's great.
And there's only one that is not included in the competition
because it's basically table tennis.
So like you're gonna get to three and win,
so there's no high score.
But everything else is on the table for the competition.
And what we're going to do for this one is a little game I like to call fast run.
Oh, mainly because we want to do one that's quick just to give you all the idea of what's
going on and not spend 45 minutes on this video.
So side note, does that make us a video podcast now?
Is that what's going on here?
Vodcast.
Oh, Vodcast.
Got it.
Okay, cool.
So yeah, we're gonna play fast run, which is a we're effectively trying to steer around
cars in a certain amount of time to get the furthest down the track and of course get
the highest score and whoever gets the lowest score will be penalized in an undisclosed way.
So look forward to that as well. So if someone doesn't turn up on the next episode,
that's, that's what happened. We don't know. We're not, we're not saying anything at this
point, but I just want to say coming in last, not going to be good for you. So good luck to both of
And with that I think we will launch into the game.
I think if we launch in we can all be at the start screen because you don't start until I think you click one more time if I remember right.
Fast run.
I'm at the start ready to go.
I got the little hand going back and forth.
How do you start?
Let's go in three.
I think you have to click.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
And 3, 2, 1, go.
Go!
You can't use keyboard.
You got to use the mouse.
I'm winning.
You can.
You can use the arrows.
I'm winning. Are you? My arrows don't work. I've basically won already. Okay, we'll try another way. I'm using the mouse
All right overtaking the yellow car. What a loser. I'm ahead. I'm ahead.
How are you ahead? We're not even on the same track. Oh, we are in my mind. Now for people listening to this
This is actually really exciting. We're going up and down the hills. I am absolutely blitzing it now
I just crashed into a car. Hopefully I can synchronize that in final cut. Inside lane. Oh, jeez. Inside lane.
I should have, I didn't, I'm not wearing my glasses. Well, that's your mistake Andrew. Oh, jeez tight one
So do you think when you're editing this in Final Cut you're gonna like edit it to make your your run look better?
Oh, geez
I don't think I can do anything that magical Jason. I think I'm pretty stuffed. I don't know. I've heard it's pretty good
Yes, I'm in the city. So am I we must be in sync roughly Andrew. Well, cuz we're fast now Andrew
Tell us about the car. We're driving today not to distract you at all. Yeah, this is like an outrun variant
There's no girl no blonde in the passenger seat in this one a little bit disappointing
So that's a more inclusive change for modern audiences.
- I don't think there's anybody in the car in mine,
just kind of an empty car.
It's like a ghost car.
- I'd like to think of it as a Toyota
because they do lean manufacturing.
So this would be well put together, this vehicle.
- Well, it hits cars really well.
- What I particularly love about this is that feeling
that even though you're not getting any vibration
or kind of haptic feedback through the computer,
you feel that sensation of going up and over the hills.
It's like, ooh.
And there's actually a road in Wollongong,
suburb called Taraji,
which is famous for this dip over a railway line.
And you can always be sure that your guts
end up in your throat every time you drive over it.
That's what it's reminding me of.
- Oh, I like that feeling when you're in the car.
- You like that feeling of your stomach up in your throat.
- Yeah, I do like it.
- Can you tell how Jason's not speaking,
probably because he's winning and he's focusing.
- He's locked in, isn't he?
(laughing)
- I can't do both at the same time.
- This car actually does look like my Camry.
- Oh no.
- I just need to make sure I'm not last
because I really don't want the punishment of being last.
- Oh, I'll be last.
Did you know I have a red Camry?
You do.
This is basically your car.
So this is literally me.
Do you feel like you're driving your actual car, Andrew?
I do.
I'm driving to Kalgoorlie as we speak through the desert.
I am done.
Oh, how did I not hit that?
I am done.
Done.
I was literally on the checkered board and it quit.
It died.
All right.
Let's share the scores.
Is that the finish line?
Here's something interesting.
Is that the finish line?
Did you get to the finish line?
Yes.
Is that the finish line?
Oh, it's not just a continuous thing.
No, it will end.
It's the first time I've ever finished that game. It's about the time.
Top scores are what? Anyway, never mind me.
I'm feeling like Andrew might not be the top score.
So I'm going to go ahead and let you go first.
Okay. It says new record.
Okay.
So this is my best ever performance.
44,736.
Wow.
Is that good?
Well, I was doing the most crap talking.
So I actually probably lost with 35,169.
You did.
I had 43570.
Wow.
Look at that.
What a twist.
What an upset.
Wow.
The David Ducofny/David Wenham lookalike we established before the recording has taken the victory on the same show.
He has.
Congratulations.
Put it on the leaderboard now.
Seed that leaderboard for Arcadia June.
Andrew Canyon, number one spot with the Toyota Camry.
That was brilliant.
I am 92nd for all time of today extra fun that I won. I've saved my recording wait
Why is it saying do I want to replace it did it already save?
It should have automatically saved
Shouldn't have to do a save again
50 megabytes, that's quite small. Oh, yeah, it did. I didn't check. Oh, no. What'd you do 50 megabytes?
Oh, no, did you not save it? Mine's like a gig and a half. It was recording an mp3 file
(laughing)
- Just put a giant face palm emoji underneath his screen.
- So isn't it great that the one who won
does not have a video?
I think that's great.
We leave it that way
'cause that's another beautiful twist.
- You didn't tell me to check that setting.
- Well, we were recording video.
You know the old mp3 screen recording oh, I know hang on hang on hang on hang on
Hang on. I think there may we may have a twist another twist
What is that file then twist upon a twist upon a twist file in downloads?
Oh, God. He's recording with devin think or something hang on hang on. I think
Let me put this over here. I think I have it guys hang on
1.3 gigs
It's a it is ah I was gonna say you're 50 megabyte video of a high quality display sure
I'm just making sure it actually is there I am
Good I don't know what this other file is you can still just put dot mp3 underneath his
Thing in the video screen recording on the 26th of May. Oh, that's a couple of days ago. So do you have it or not?
Yeah, I'm confused. I've got all right great. Just wondering what these other file a little two days ago
