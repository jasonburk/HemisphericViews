*An update!* Thank you to everyone who participated in our Twitter polls about macOS Finder usage after [episode 018](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/018).

We're excited to share the results: when [launching a new Finder window](https://twitter.com/HemisphericV/status/1351846085900206082?s=20), the majority of voters (83.3%) click on the icon; and when it comes to [the window view](https://twitter.com/HemisphericV/status/1351846245485080578?s=20), it was a tie between icons and columns (38.9%).
