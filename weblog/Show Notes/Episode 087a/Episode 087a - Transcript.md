Hi I'm Andrew and I'm Jason and I'm Martin this is hemispheric views.
I have to start with a question straight away how would you actually record a podcast on windows.
I have absolutely no idea how you do it.
Windows Media Player. Would that do it?
Yeah, maybe.
I think there's a voice recorder. You can download a voice recorder from the Microsoft
store. I don't know if it's default. That was a few years ago when I looked at that, I think.
It's probably no audio hijack though, is it?
Isn't that funny? Like you just have no idea how to do something on another platform.
No.
Yeah, doesn't matter.
I mean, surely people do it, right?
They must.
- They must.
- Actually, I reckon a lot of people would go for web apps.
Like you'd have Zencasters and otter.ai
'cause you don't really even have to do that
with a native app now.
It's just all done and transcribed on the web.
- I bet you're right.
There are a lot of those webby things
that let people kind of,
and then you like edit it right in there too, I think.
So that's probably, yeah, I could see that.
- Okay.
It's not how we roll.
So are we, are we going to switch?
Are we all going to collectively switch to windows then?
So we can do that.
Is that what you're suggesting?
Negative.
Oh, okay.
Keep just status quo.
Keep doing what we're doing.
Yeah.
Okay.
We're good.
Jason, have you got, um, iOS 17 going?
I have it on one device.
Um, I have it on my phone only right now.
It's actually, I'm, I've been doing a very annoying thing for the last couple of days
since it came out, there's this feature in accessibility
where you go into it and you read sentences
and it records you reading these sentences for,
I think it said it was gonna take an hour,
but it only took me maybe 20 minutes.
And you just read all these seemingly random sentences.
And I think what it's doing is it's effectively making
my voice that I can use.
Like if I had, if there were a reason
that I could not use my voice
from an accessibility standpoint,
I could use the phone to speak,
but not like in a Siri voice,
but like my actual voice.
- Like a deep fake.
- So I was very intrigued by that.
I don't need it obviously,
but I'm just, I'm curious about the technology part of it.
So I went through the whole training thing for,
like I said, like 20 minutes,
and read all these weird sentences
and started to go a little bit crazy
because I was just in my office by myself
just reading these like weird sentences to myself,
looking at the phone,
trying to keep the phone exactly six inches from my mouth
like it said to.
And then when it's done, it says,
okay, now plug your phone in and like turn the screen off,
which joke's on you, always on screen,
so figure that out.
and it's gonna like do the crazy processing or whatever
on device, all on device to like make my voice say whatever.
So I was like, okay, cool.
Tonight when I go to bed,
I'll throw it on the little chargey dock on my nightstand,
the little MagSafe thing,
wake up in the morning and it'll be done.
Get up and it's like, hey, this is paused.
You need to plug your phone in.
I was like, oh, like, I need to actually plug
like a lightning cable in apparently.
Okay, so I did that.
A couple days later, I'm still like trying to get that to work.
It says it's 90% done, which if you've ever worked in any working environment and ask
somebody how far along is a project, they're always going to say it's 90% there, right?
So TBD on...
Do you say that?
Never.
No, I'm, I always lowball it.
I'm like, we're like 30% because then you're always going to beat it.
But so I don't know.
I was hoping actually to record this whole episode
using this fake iPhone voice that's supposedly me,
but maybe episode 88 will be that
and that will just be a version of me.
But I think that's really cool from a technology standpoint
to be able to have the device speak on your behalf
based on what you type, but in your own actual voice.
I think it just lends a bit of, I don't know,
humanity to it in a way where it's not just like robot voice.
So I don't know, we'll see.
Hopefully it'll finish some time and we'll actually get to use it.
That's cool. And just to clarify, when you say the new iOS that is out,
and I have installed it, you mean developer beta one, which is out.
This is not for your normal everyday person. They're looking at software update.
Where is it? I want this feature. Wait another three or four months.
And you might get it.
September. Yeah. September. Or I guess public beta in July, but yeah, for me,
developer beta one on day one at hour one, basically gold master as far as I'm concerned.
So let's just get it on there.
I say I've always loved that term.
It sounds like some kind of championship level or status that you've achieved.
The gold master.
Yeah, it's very over the top.
See how I think of it.
Of course, my mind goes straight to the matrix.
Do you remember when Neo walks into the tea house and reload and sees the code in the room,
but says that Sarah if his golden code is a different kind of program he's like the gold master he is yeah.
Andrews like thanks man.
Apple held like a little a little event that none of us went to of course because we're not that special we watched it on the live stream well on the delayed stream.
Because I'm not getting up at 1am Perth time WWDC worldwide developer conference.
The big keynote they they announced some new Macs. They announced some new software updates
They announced a new pair of ski goggles no matching Parker though pretty disappointing. Well, they have it
It's just it's exclusive to Apple Park gift shop. You got to go to Apple Park to go to go to Apple Parker
Yeah
Very good. I just imagine it would be like you would just get wet and it'd be like your jacket is now dry
Yes, www.dc.net happened.
And I have, I have five things to talk about.
Okay.
Because I'm surprised it's so low.
Yeah.
Five things.
Well, one I already did.
So technically I only have four left.
Okay.
So one was the accessibility personal voice thing.
Okay.
And then I've got four others.
Type 45, Jason.
Type 45, yeah.
Do you want me to just to run through them?
Do you wanna give feedback?
What do you, how do you wanna,
how do you wanna go about this?
- Speed run.
- Okay, speed run, here we go.
15 inch MacBook Pro.
Oop, sorry, 15 inch MacBook Air.
Sorry, there we go, MacBook Air.
I think this is an incredible option
for the masses that want a Mac
because I think the 13 inch is great,
but like the phones, I think more so on the computer,
people really want a bigger screen.
Like the more screen you can get, the better.
So now I think it's just, it fits this perfect model.
We have a 1315 for a MacBook Air.
We have a 1416 for a MacBook Pro.
I feel like that really covers the range
from both a screen size and performance standpoint.
standpoint really, really well. So I think the 15-inch MacBook Air is a really good thing to have.
Comments, questions, anything? Or you want me to keep going?
I have one question about the screen resolution of the 15-inch. Is it too low? Have they actually
increased? Because I read something that the resolution hasn't been improved and it's
significantly less than the Pro, which doesn't surprise me. But if it's just the 13-inch
resolution. Just magnified. That's not great. So it says here display 13.6 inch on the 13
inch. Yep. Okay. So it says here for pixels, 2,560 by 1,664 on the 13 inch and 2,880 by 1,864 pixels
on the 15. Okay, so it is bigger. Hmm, but the PPI's and all that, I'm not very good at that math
off the top of my head. But it seems like it'd be reasonable on par. I think it's the sort of
thing that you could probably quibble about if you did some advanced test on it, but the masses are
not really going to notice. It's going to be sharp either way. Yeah, I think it's going to be an
incredible machine for a lot of people. So MacBook Air, awesome. Next one, Safari Spaces. I think
I think that's great, 'cause that's one of my favorite
features of the Arc browser, which is having dedicated
spaces for my different kind of personas in my life.
I think that is one of the biggest draws to Arc for me.
So I'll be very curious to see how they do it in Safari
and how they do it differently, the same or otherwise.
Next one is the Vision Pro.
So, Vision Pro, the hardware specs are incredible.
If you know anything about the VR space
or these different headsets,
just this general area of what the hardware is,
the specs of the Vision Pro are phenomenal,
like next level kind of stuff.
And that's super cool, and I'm very excited about that.
That being said, I don't fully know
what I would do with this,
'cause I've never used one, obviously.
It's not gonna be out until next year.
So for me personally, I'm just sort of parking this
in the back of my brain for six months
and not gonna even worry about it.
I'm not gonna speculate, I'm not gonna do anything
because I haven't seen it, I haven't used one.
It is the very beginning of it.
So I'll be very interested to see
what actually ships beginning of next year.
And I think from a price standpoint, it's $3,500,
which is a lot.
- Yeah.
- Let's just all, let me just say here,
let's remember how much the original Macintosh cost in 1984
and how much the Lisa cost before that.
So I think that kind of puts all this in perspective,
very expensive, but cheap as chips by those earlier ideas.
- I also don't see this as a primary device.
I don't think you're gonna walk into a store
with this first version and say,
"Should I get a MacBook Pro or a Vision Pro?
"Oh, I'll just get a Vision Pro."
Like that's not happening right now.
But same thing with like the Apple Watch, right?
Where you didn't get the original Apple Watch and say,
"I don't need an iPhone anymore, like screw that."
So it's similar in that vein.
And you know, it's a specialized product
for a select group of people that will use such a thing
and eventually it will turn into something else.
I'm mostly just intrigued by the tech
that they're building now, like going out into other areas.
I think that's gonna be interesting.
So I just think it's way too early
to say anything about it, honestly.
- I think there's a lot more to say about the Vision Pro,
but I'll let you finish here.
- Yeah, I just wanna say quickly,
the first Apple Watch that was released,
one of the models was $10,000.
So just keep that in.
Would you have bought a Series Zero Apple Watch
and paid $10,000?
Some people did.
I certainly wouldn't have.
So that makes the Vision Pro look cheap.
- Can I make a quick comment on that?
I actually wrote on my blog several years ago
when that was first announced,
a piece that is probably really outdated
where I wrote why the Apple Watch needs to be expensive.
Now reading that, now you go, that seems ridiculous.
That's outdated.
Of course it should be cheaper so people have access to it.
I totally agree.
But in that first year, like with the Vision Pro,
it completely blew everyone else out of the water.
Anything like Pebbles or other smartwatches.
Case in point, I think the same with these headsets.
So by going for that higher echelon, that higher level,
I think it makes everyone else look totally irrelevant.
So I think we'll see that price drop.
And this is really just a big statement
to get everyone ready for what the cream of the crop
actually will be.
So I think it's actually quite a wise move.
- I don't really think there's a lot to scrutinize about it.
I mean, it's as with every product that ever comes out ever,
no one is forced to buy it.
So that's good.
I'm glad about that.
And it's a first gen and the first gen of everything
is pricey.
That's how these things tend to go.
So I think it'll be again,
very interesting to see where it goes,
but the fact that they came out with such incredible hardware
on a Gen 1 and it's still relatively small in all things considered in terms of headsets.
I think it's cool. I'm very intrigued to see what it is. I'm not like clamoring to get one right now,
but I do think it's going to be a very interesting thing to watch.
And how and mostly, not mostly, but a lot of it, I think, will be how does this product
inform the direction of other adjacent products, right?
Because, you know, we had the Mac,
then we had iOS and iPadOS,
and those things all started to kind of
mix together over time.
Then we had the Apple Watch,
and like half the things on the Vision Pro
are like Apple Watch pieces, it looks like.
There's like a couple crowns on there,
there's the little pull tabs from the Apple Watch Ultra.
So there's like--
button turned camera shutter.
- Right, yeah, so there's like some clear
like cross pollination of stuff,
which on the surface of it at first,
you could easily be like, oh, they're just,
you know, that's so dumb.
They're just making, they're pulling parts
and reusing them in other places.
But as hardware pieces become less and less,
like you almost want them to be more unified
across all things because they become more specialized
in how they work.
and like a crown has a twist and a twist and a push,
maybe a pull someday,
like there's different things it could do.
So I think by being as similar as possible
across platforms, it just makes it that much more natural
to jump right in and be like,
"Oh, I know how this works already.
I know what this is gonna do.
I have an expectation."
Versus relearn everything on every single device.
Like nobody wants to do that.
So yeah, I think the Vision Pro is super interesting
And anything that anybody says today doesn't matter because it's going to be
eight months before we actually see what it's like.
And it's not going to be, it's not going to be available in Australia.
So Martin and I don't even have the opportunity to buy it,
even if we wanted to and could.
Oh, is it not, not on, this is like an iPhone situation.
I think later in the year.
I thought it was only US only at this stage. So that was my understanding of it.
It also makes me, it also makes me wonder whether,
whether our internet infrastructure will be able to support it. So you've got two 4k screens,
you could potentially be streaming double two sets of 4k video down. How many people have
bandwidth, home bandwidth in Australia to support that? Now Jason, you with your gigabit fiber,
not an issue. Good to go. Gigabit fiber in Australia, unheard of. Like we just plug the
fiber directly into the headset. It's just, yeah. So Andrew, don't you dare question an Australian's
ability to thrive on Telstra's greatest Australia-wide network. All right. I'm sorry.
Side tangent on the broadband. Do you all have caps? Like data caps? Or is it just that the
speeds are not super low? Or not super high? I think it depends on the plan. So I have uncapped
I have infinite data but infinite to the point that you can actually lower now the speed says the same but because the speed is.
Relatively low to begin with.
How much can you.
I say stuff like God around this time it's a high traffic period and you may encounter blah blah blah.
I don't know it's like even if you had a cap you couldn't hit it because they bring down the speed so much that it's like you can't download it all anyway.
Yeah I mean our plans are, speed is useless you know and it's, we've always got a geographical disadvantage because so much of the data is coming from the US anyway, it's got to travel half around the world through some undersea pipes to get here.
But it's definitely been under invested at the local level so we're always going to struggle until that is improved.
What else we got to about WWDC Martin you've been quite quiet on it, any thoughts?
Well, we're letting Jason have his one more. I have one more to throw out. Yeah, say the Iowa. No, I said five. This is this is number five.
This is number five, iOS keyboard. I like the changes in the iOS keyboard in terms of spelling correction and the way that it flows for like, identifying words, you're going to type and so forth. I think they've updated it in a good way. And I enjoy using it. I think it's great.
The only since since Martin is taking the piss as it were, I'm going to throw in a number six,
which is in I'm happy to hear that in messages. When you bring up the little plus to like do
other things like emoji and stuff, there's this new menu that is so incredibly different design
wise than anything else on the system. And I have to believe that we have not seen anything in terms
of new design for iOS 17, if this is any indication whatsoever.
So I find it hard to believe that this whole menu would be updated in this new weird design
and the rest of the system would stay exactly the same.
That seems unlikely.
But do you like this design?
Is it a good thing?
I don't have a feeling about it at this point.
It's just sort of, it's so different than everything else that I think if it were system
wide, I think it could work.
And I'm okay with a system wide refresh
in terms of just how things look and how they feel.
So I would be okay with this.
- Am I right in saying that actually covers the whole screen
or does this translucent thing?
- Most of it, yeah.
- Right, 'cause it reminds me of the uselessness
of the iPad version of Control Center.
This little thing you toggle from the corner
but everything must be obscured.
So I suppose that's a similarity
but you're talking more about the design
of how the menu looks or is navigated, is that right?
- I'm gonna go out on a limb
and assume this is like an A/B test in terms of like,
hey, we're gonna kinda seed this out in one area
and sort of feel out what people are feeling about it
to kind of use that going forward for what we decide to do.
I mean, obviously they're not gonna base
a whole redesign on like that,
but I feel like there's more to that menu
than meets the eye.
So there you go.
That's my five things, plus one.
Sorry, Martin, would you like to talk about WWDC?
I had no problem. I said it was a great idea.
Andrew just said you hadn't said much, so I went, "I'm waiting."
Go ahead. Fire it out. What was your top whatever list?
I thought everything was very impressive.
Vision Pro plus all the other systems.
A couple of standouts for me were
hearing that there'd be more flexible layouts for Stage Manager on iPadOS.
I was quite excited about that
'cause I don't like stage manager on the Mac.
I think it's kind of redundant
given the extensive system of windowing and management
that we already have.
But on the iPad, I really liked those first few steps.
It was that dynamic sizing or placement
which kind of put me off.
So the fact that it'll be more flexible is really good.
On the Mac side of things,
I'm eager to try the new kind of column of widgets
or putting widgets anywhere on your desktop.
I really loved dashboard in the past and being able to maybe have things to make the most
of my screen to the left, which doesn't really ever have much.
I know you can put them anywhere, but I can imagine arranging on the side there to have
kind of like a menu bar set of items somewhere else.
So I'm keen on that.
Yes.
I completely forgot about the widgets on the desktop.
I'm very excited for that.
I would love to have a couple, like you said, on the left side, probably top left corner
would be a prime location for those.
That would be great.
And especially now that you can like actually
do something with them,
and it's not just a big dumb ass button to go to the app.
That's huge.
Interactive widgets, I think is exactly
where it should be going.
- Yeah.
And I had some extra thoughts on the Vision Pro,
but I feel like we could talk about that a lot.
Andrew, do you want to throw anything else in feature wise
before maybe we go down a rabbit hole on that?
Yeah, okay. I'm just going to, yeah, just a couple more focusing on the actual show itself rather than the products or the updates.
Because Jason's done a good job covering those.
First of all, it's Joswiak that does the Apple Watch, right?
Is that, that's him?
No.
No.
Kevin Lynch.
Sorry.
I always forget those guys mixed up.
Kevin Lynch.
They are all white men who wear interesting shirts and sweater vests and stuff.
So it's okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And they do their Apple, they do the Apple hands all the same.
Kevin Lynch it always sounds like he's about to come down with a horrible cold.
Bit nasal.
And I always feel sorry for him.
He's like, "Oh, Kevin, you're just about to get the flu again."
Poor guy.
He's the fitness guy.
It's not a good look to have a guy that always sounds like he's about to have a cold.
So that's something they should maybe think about.
Optimizing your health.
The grass at Apple Park, man, that looks so spongy.
I was watching him in his sneakers.
Step on the grass and it just sunk, you know, two inches into it. It was like, Oh, I'd like to lie on that grass. That was my other takeaway.
It's very comfortable grass. Can't attest.
Are they leaning too heavily into Craig Federighi being cool, like daggy cool?
No, no. Lean harder into that.
Was the, okay. Cause they did the bus, they did the basketball with the, with the throwback to the track suit kind of look.
Awesome. So good.
They did the three neck guitar.
Awesome.
Okay.
They did the force grab and release of the iPad.
Could you turn that down?
If someone said to you, Hey, we're going to do this like Jedi thing with an iPad.
There's no way you could turn that down.
He did the power stance wearing tight jeans.
Like where he spreads his legs quite wide apart.
I don't recall that one, but I'll take your word for it.
Okay.
He does that.
And he did another reference to the crack marketing team which has become like his trademark.
Oh yeah that that's like a bit now.
Yeah so we're still okay they haven't overplayed their their Federico hand.
I say play it while you got it you know like Craig's not gonna be there forever you gotta use that while you got it.
Okay okay cool because I still love the guy don't get me wrong.
I think it's really cheesy, and I'm sure that it doesn't work for a lot of audience members or cultures around the world, but they don't have and haven't had Steve Jobs for a very long time.
Right. And I think Tim Cook, for all of his CEO logistical prowess, knows that he's not that guy.
So if they can find any way to humanise the event, make it accessible for all the non-developee nerd people who are watching it, particularly now that it's 100% online for everyone who isn't like a
media person I think they need something like that. Otherwise it would just be like watching
some cringy meta event or sleeping through a Microsoft presentation.
Okay. Now that is a good segue to my very last point and I'm almost ashamed to admit
this but after two, how long was it? Two and a half hours basically? It seemed like it
went for. Yeah so halfway through the Vision Pro presentation I actually started to get
a bit bored and start to tune out, which is probably not ideal.
And I was probably in the minority.
I'm sure most people were like super enthused, but I'm sitting here in Perth,
watching a stream.
And after that long length of time, I was just like, yeah, okay, get on with it.
Get on with it.
And I, some of the little details of the vision pro actually passed me by.
Um, I just didn't really take it in because I was just over it by that point.
So I think it went too long.
But they're also very dense. They're more dense than they used to be. So it's a little bit more exhausting.
Just less Apple Watch, less Myopia, less that stuff.
I just feel like it really could have been its own thing.
Like, I know why it has to be a WWDC, because it's a platform and people need to develop.
But if it weren't that people needed to develop for it, which I get that doesn't make any sense.
But if somehow it just like, I don't know,
say it ran iPad apps or whatever,
like which would be stupid, but let's just say that it did.
It could easily be its own product event by itself.
And it feels like it kind of needed that
because after we did Mac, iPhone, iPad, watch.
- TV.
- I feel like mentally it was just like
all that the brain can hold
and to do a whole nother event, basically.
It was just like there was no chance to reset.
It's almost like if this were on day two,
or something, like they would never do that.
But let's say there was a day two keynote or something,
and like that was day two only for an hour.
I feel like that would have really helped
the like mental separation,
just because it's such a different product, right?
Like a Mac and an iPhone and an iPad and a watch,
They're all apps, they're all on a flat screen.
You poke 'em, you don't poke 'em, you mouse 'em, whatever.
They're all kind of the same stuff.
But to have this like, holy shift in like mindset
of what is even possible,
I don't know if we had enough like brain cells left
at that point to like fully comprehend.
It was just like, wow, shiny, ah, my brain turned off.
I don't know what to even do.
That's kind of, I feel like maybe what happened, is that?
- Yeah, that's probably a really good way of putting it.
I mean, don't get me wrong, the tech in it is incredible.
It's amazing.
But also, I think as well, because I'm looking at it going like it's amazing, but it's just a tech demo at this point.
Like, it's not for me.
I'm not about to go buy one.
Nobody I know is.
Well, maybe Jason is going to buy one.
But it's so far into the future that it's like it's not it's cool, but it's not actionable.
Sorry, Jason, was that yet a throwaway yet or a confirmation yet about buying?
Probably both.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but also like of all the,
I think they even said this multiple times,
but like these kinds of products can not be
demoed on a T like you can't watch that.
There's just no part of it that translates zero. It doesn't work.
They show like the T-Rex coming out of the wall and it's like, it's a flat,
I'm on a flat screen with not spatial 3d audio around my
head, it won't translate. It's, that's the biggest problem with things in the VR
space is that there is absolutely nothing you can do short of putting a
headset on somebody and saying, do it. As soon as you do it, you go, holy crap,
this is unreal, but you cannot translate that. It's the worst kind of product
to demo on this kind of thing until you can walk into an Apple store, look at
pixel density of the screen and you're looking at it on a monitor that straight up says HDMI on the bottom right corner like you're not going to be able to know the pixel density right like it's just not going to happen.
Let all three of us have used some sort of VR goggles before right.
Yeah yeah we have one.
Yeah I've used one.
Martin have you used one?
Yeah.
Only ever once and it made me feel a little bit ill but yes.
Okay but yeah it is cool isn't it when you put them on and and you're like whoa you look around it's like far out.
It would be really interesting to know and Apple's doing it at a super high resolution.
That is going to be key especially to like the sickness thing the refresh rate the resolution the eye tracking.
That is what also different lenses for different eyes kind of like prescription so you can tell that they've thought about accessibility a bit more.
And and and the fact that you're looking around still seeing your own space everything else whenever I've used one I've launched I'm launching to suddenly I'm on a mountain top or you're on Mars or something like that this is much more like you put it on and I'm right where I was.
I'm just looking at everything as a video display rather than live but if they can make that convincingly so it looks like real life,
That's true augmented reality at that point isn't it in a sense it's not because you reality is being faked but it's stupid is being augmented it's it's a really interesting and different approach to whatever you use before.
This conversation on whatever show episode is seven or eight months from now.
I think is going to be very interesting after we've been to an Apple store and tried it or seen it in some way.
I think it's going to be a very interesting conversation to look forward to.
Something that I wanted to bring up, which is more of a, it's not negative, but it's kind of a critique or my, let's say, social concern about the product.
I've heard a lot of people on different podcasts and read people in different blogs and articles
talk about their social concerns about things like recording the children's birthday party
through the headset or how lonely people look, you know, in rooms and stuff. I totally understand
this and I agree with a lot of that to a certain extent. But I think what people are missing in
this sense is we've gone through the same kind of moral panic or social issues with phones,
other computers, AirPods. People continue to use them in ways that are inappropriate
or weird or antisocial, but for the most part, we iron out what these problems are and work out
where and how they should be used, right? So I think it's weird and it will be strange,
but we'll get past it. The thing that I'm a little bit about is as technically impressive
as the product is, and in particular, things like these environments, you know, these environments
that you can put around yourself like you're in the middle of, I don't know, Yosemite National
Park while watching a movie on a fake big screen, right? It's when it passes into that area of
escapism or mindfulness that I think this is going to be one of the most interesting things
that we see develop over time. Because have either of you seen a movie called Aniara?
Does not sound familiar, no.
Okay, and you're probably going to go, "Oh, of course," because it's a Swedish movie,
and you're going, "Oh, here's one of Martin's weird film festival moments."
Here we go, yep.
watching the presentation, all of that stuff about floating mindfulness beads and escape in this
environment in your lounge room, it is 100% the same as this thing from this movie. So if you
let me digress for a second, because I think this will be interesting to revisit in a year,
like Jason was saying, basically, it's the story of these people who are trying to escape a ruined
Earth. Basically, everyone's shipping off to Mars on this ship. And the Aneara is this kind of
carrier of people moving to Mars. And on the ship, they have this technology called MIMA.
And MIMA is essentially this room where you escape the misery of what you're going through.
And they have fully synthesized virtual reality representations of what Earth used to be like.
So they're escaping the misery. Yeah, similar ideas. Other sci-fi stuff has done it before.
But connecting to the Vision Pro, what I thought was interesting was it's like this luxury liner
matching up with the Vision Pro as a device,
helping you escape the reality of your everyday.
And I kind of think it's just a little bit strange,
the idea that you would essentially be sitting
in your own home around what would once be things
like communal televisions or social spaces with family,
and then try to cut off from your own relaxing sanctuary
in the world by layering another virtual experience
over the top.
'Cause I know people probably use them out there,
I'm not a huge kind of advocate of mindfulness through screens. And I think this whole part of
the presentation actually kind of contradicted Apple's point about screen time and screen health.
Because if they're advocating that this becomes some sort of cannibalizing product for the Mac
and the iPad, you could assume that with the Apple Watch and stuff, good for just as mobile devices.
you're kind of advocating as Apple that everyone has screens in front of their eyeballs all day,
every day, working or leisure. So I think this will be the massive societal shift of whether
we want to have stuff in front of our eyeballs even closer every single day. What do you two
make of that? Well, it was funny because they had the doctor on just before this segment talking
about screen distance. Exactly. And then immediately went into strap that shit to your face. And I was
I was like, wait, what?
I'm confused.
How's that?
That was a weird transition, but okay.
- Anyway, thank you for tolerating my long rant there,
but do you know what I mean?
It feels kind of contradictory.
- Well, I think you're exactly right though.
Like the phone thing.
If you go to a concert,
there's 15 phones up recording the concert
instead of being at the concert.
Or you can illustrate a million of those examples
all day long.
And like all technology that we get
is always like apocalypse first and then like useful later.
And, and this is no different. I think that's exactly what you're saying.
So I'm not surprised that that's sort of where it goes to initially.
And I think also all technology sort of ends up being something different than it
started out as generally. So I do think it'll be,
it will be intriguing to see like where this does go and maybe it goes nowhere.
Maybe this is the first product
that's like an absolute just bomb
and it is a gen one never to be seen again.
I doubt it, but it's possible.
I mean, you know, in an infinite timescale,
all things are possible.
So we'll see.
- But I honestly think in Apple's brain,
they say this is replacing the Mac and the iPad.
- Yeah, possibly. - Mainly.
- Possibly. - And iPhone and Apple watch
have their on-body mobile.
- Yeah, I still like that even if I happen to be,
you know, addicted to my phone doing a thing,
I do like that I could just kind of throw it on the table
or walk out of the room and it's gone.
I do think that having a thing on your body
for eight hours a day is almost never going
to be comfortable or acceptable to anyone.
It's just not, like physically it's going to be annoying
to have this thing on for that long.
Like it can get as small as you want.
I mean, Martin, you wear glasses every day.
At some point, you just wanna take
the goddamn glasses off your face
and like give your face a rest.
And that's just glasses.
Honestly, the most exciting thing that I saw
was when they connected it to a Mac.
It's like, oh crap, I can have like a 400 inch screen
in front of me.
You know how big my dock could be?
That's gonna be great.
So like, already.
- And you'd put it on the side, of course, right?
- Oh, absolutely.
All that screen real estate.
Yeah, so much space.
Yeah, so I think, let's wait and see.
And I'm sure we'll have more to say as time goes on.
Once I get the call to get the secret sneak peek at it,
I'll inform everybody of what I find.
- All right, folks, that's been 45 minutes.
That's show, that's hemispheric views for this week.
It's high 45.
Next topic, topic two.
Are we ready for topic two now?
