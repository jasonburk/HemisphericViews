(upbeat music)
- Cool, so I should preface this episode
by saying that we have a very special guest today.
Someone who I've been regarding
as the second generation Feldfoot,
the new and improved version of the family,
and that is my sister, Jodie.
How's it going, Jodie?
Thanks for joining us.
Thank you, Martin.
Hello, everyone.
Jason, Andrew, Martin, good to be here, and everyone listening in.
Yes, so I'm Jodie Feld, the younger sister of Martin.
And I'm very happy to be here today.
It's taken a while for me to get here, but very excited to chat.
We've had to put up with Martin for 40 some odd episodes
just to get to this point in our podcasting career.
So I think we've pretty much plateaued at this point, I would say.
So we've pretty much now we're at the point
where we have the field we actually wanted.
- Great, yeah.
- There you go, there you go.
Don't, be careful what you wish for
because I may have a bit of a felled foot as well actually.
So there's two felled feet coming down.
(laughing)
- Oh no.
- Jason, this isn't going according to plan already.
- I'm okay with it, honestly.
I think it's okay.
I've got my red pen, so I think it should be fine.
- Now, I thought I might transition
as to why we have Jodie here.
Of course, she's here to answer any questions
that you have about me, which is not my intention.
It wasn't an ego trip, but you know,
she can uncover the dirt.
But there's the world of finance, right?
I'm not much of a financial guy.
We know that Andrew likes to keep his spreadsheets,
budget things.
It's a very sensible, pragmatic approach.
And even though it's not for me, I respect it.
Jodie, on the other hand, is an interesting case
because back when I was working in Sydney
and I was commuting, I stumbled across some budgeting apps
and that was my first foray into it.
and I very quickly discovered how much I hated it.
But before I discovered that, I got Jody onto it.
Now, Andrew, Jody is someone who respects the financial app
and I thought we could have a special edition of App Corner
which investigates this particular area
which we've often neglected 'cause it's your area of fandom.
- And it's terribly boring, don't forget that.
- Well, Jody's gonna spice things up today, I hope.
- So you--
- I have a number of apps to talk about, actually.
- You found a category of apps that you absolutely hated
and said, "Hey, here you go."
That was your handoff.
I like that, that's nice.
It's a good thing to do to your sibling.
- Yeah, exactly.
(Jody singing)
You want apps, we got apps.
It's Hemispheric Apps.
Boop, boop, bop.
- So Jody, I mean, is that a fair background
or context for everyone?
How do you wanna get into this?
- Just a bit of further context, yeah.
So I think it was back in 2016,
Martin and I were both working in Sydney
and commuting together, which was a fun time in our lives.
I had just started my first full-time job.
And I think Martin and I had always been good at,
you know, sensible spenders and managing our money,
but he got me onto this app called Spendy,
which I believe he mentioned in a previous podcast
that I had received a notification from the app
congratulating me on my five-year spendyversary,
which was a very exciting moment for me.
- I think Martin's interaction with that was he opened it,
I think looked at it and then deleted it,
I think is how that went.
I think that was his review, so.
- That was after one of my three or four
attempted reinstalls to get back into it.
So that's pretty accurate, but not the first time.
- Okay.
- Well, I think Martin, he gave it a red hot go,
but he got sick of doing the manual entering
of each transaction, which I can understand,
but there is automation.
You can connect it to your bank if you like to do that.
I've personally actually stuck
by manually entering everything.
I much prefer it.
- For five years?
- For five years, yes.
And it's been incredibly handy.
And again, you know, Jason Martin,
you might find this boring,
but they have a lot of nice colored graphs
and they show you the growth over time
and your different accounts and everything like that.
And obviously there's lots of financial management apps
out there, but the thing that got me with Spendy
was obviously Martin sort of got me onto it first.
They had a 50% off lifetime premium,
which was only $60 or something
to have all the features of the app.
And I just committed to it.
And I just love it.
I live off it.
And I don't understand people who
don't keep record of their finances and budgeting.
It's been so helpful to me in my life.
I hope that $60 lifetime is more ironclad than the guarantees
that YNAB made to their potential customers
about future discounts.
But anyway, I digress.
[LAUGHTER]
Wow, spendy.
OK, so wait, first of all, you said you could tie banks to it.
I thought you guys weren't allowed to do that there.
Have I been lied to by Andrew that that is a thing you can do?
I don't know what information Andrew is referring to specifically.
I haven't connected my bank.
I didn't like that function, hence why I still manually enter everything.
But what is that, Andrew, that you're mentioning?
Essentially, you said Spendy can connect to the banks.
That's a step that YNAB doesn't even offer in Australia.
So, cause I'm obviously a YNAB guy for better or worse at the moment.
Worse.
They offer it in the US.
They've just launched it in the European union, but nothing in Australia.
Oh, okay.
Which is annoying.
There are some third party applications that promise to connect to your bank and
then they'll connect to YNAB and act as an intermediary.
Just something I'm not totally comfortable doing.
I'll do that for you as well.
If you'd like.
But like Jodie, there's something to be said for manual entry.
Because it's so easy to spend money these days with everything's credit card, right?
You're either using your phone, your watch, an actual bit of plastic.
You're never taking dollars out and going, there you go, money flying away.
So it's, it disassociates you from the act of spending money.
So by putting it in, taking those few seconds to punch it in, that's the little
pain point and the reminder of, "Oh look, money is actually leaving."
True.
I think it encourages me to spend less as well.
It's like, "Oh, fewer transactions to pop into the app."
And I think when you have been budgeting and looking at your finances for five years for
me or however long it's been for you, Andrew, you get an idea of what you're spending monthly
or weekly or however long.
You can see where the money is going personally.
It's been really helpful for me.
I mean, last year I bought myself an apartment in Sydney and going through the whole loan
process, I didn't really, you know, the guy was like, "Oh, you're a dream person to give
a loan to because you've got five years right here.
You know, don't even need to look at all your statements and everything."
So, you know, and it's been a really good way of managing that and having particular
financial goals and going, "Okay, I'll hit that."
So much to Martin's sort of surprise, I think I've really sort of got into that and each
year setting a number of financial goals, tracking everything, watching my super and
everything like that, which again, Martin won't take a look at.
So yeah, but I think it's quite interesting because Martin kind of made a bit of a money
monster out of me all those years ago by introducing me to Spendy.
And I think that's not the only app I'd like to talk about today because my interest in
this has broadened and I think that Jason has a question.
I have a question. You said watching your super.
Can you elaborate on that for the listeners, please?
Can I please make one little translation just because I've always wanted to say this in like...
Okay, let me try it. Think about your Roth IRA or your 401k.
Right, I think about those daily.
I've always just wanted to say that.
Is that a traditional or a Roth?
I was waiting for the 401k.
- So a super is related to that, I take it.
- Jodie?
- Yeah, yeah.
I've only heard of the 401k in America,
but yeah, your superannuation.
You know, your employer or whoever putting money away
for your retirement.
- I will ask HR about my super next week
and see what they have to say about that.
Okay, continue.
I just, I like to be the one to help facilitate
the translations amongst the group.
I love superannuation.
I know you love superannuation.
That's a legitimate t-shirt he would wear every single day.
That's the next product we're selling.
Not even not even saying any brand affiliations or which super funds Andrew might like or be with.
Right. Andrew, am I right in saying that every time superannuation ads come up like from little things, big things grow, you get a little
little flutter in your chest or something or people talk.
Yes. And Andrew Jody's doing the little hand movement.
We're gonna have to do this in the show notes.
- Compare the pair.
- Same age, same income, same super contributions.
- What the (beep) happened to Sam?
- You love it, don't you?
- I'm this far up the escalator, my friend,
and I'm just looking back down.
- What is the hands?
What is that?
- It's the logo, right?
It's like these lines that, they don't really intersect.
They kind of form a shape with holes in it,
but they use the hands as like this way
of linking to the logo at the end,
like you're cradling and fostering your super
and its growth.
Wow, okay.
- Yeah.
- Do you know one of the most interesting things
about superannuation is it's sort of,
it's viewed as a commercial investment product, right?
You're investing, money is being invested
in corporate entities.
- You're right, yeah.
- I swear. - Ironically.
- You sound like you're trying to sell me this right now.
It's one of the most interesting things
that most people don't know about a super.
- The best performing super funds
are actually those which are member-based,
not those which are corporate in their own rights.
So ironically, the corporate entities
that try to invest in corporate entities
don't do as well as those entities that are member-based,
not-for-profit, distributing most of their,
all the money back to members who are investing
in corporate entities, delivering the best returns.
Industry super funds, disliked by the current government.
- Okay.
- I was gonna say, are we promising this
as like a benefit to listeners now
that they also get financial advice through the podcast?
'Cause that's like a One Prime Plus thing.
- I think One Prime Plus does offer both 401k
and the option for a super,
depending on where you're located.
So that will be in the fine print.
- We could offer a Hemispheric Views SMSF.
- We, I think we do already.
If you look at subclause three, it's in there.
- Ah, okay, cool.
That would explain all that extra Patreon revenue
just pouring into our accounts.
We're meant to be investing that.
- Yeah, yeah, you should be.
Yeah, yeah.
- Moving to software,
that I was actually thrilled
when she accepted the app recommendation originally,
Because normally I'm the guy going, oh, you should try this app or have you ever thought about writing in this or something?
And I just get kind of like eye rolls constantly.
But this one, oh, it just went off the charts.
And you've got more apps now.
How many times has he tried to make you use IA Writer?
I don't know if he hasn't asked me about that one specifically or I just wasn't really listening to the name of it.
Probably the latter.
I think so. Yeah.
Yeah. He's tried to recommend lots of things to me.
Sorry.
Do you write in Markdown?
I don't really write in anything.
So hence why writing apps are not really required for me.
He's tried to get me, you know, to do a blog and all different kinds of things,
which I see the value in, but ain't nobody got time for that personally.
So yeah.
That's another t-shirt. I love it. We got so many things today.
Catchphrases. Yeah. No. So yeah, Martin's tried to recommend many apps to me.
doesn't take any recommendations that I give him
in any facet of life. - No, of course not.
That checks out.
Typical foot.
It's all output, nothing's coming in.
- Exactly, yeah.
I'll get onto more of that later.
But to wrap up the finance section of this chat.
So the Spendy app really ignited
this financial passion in me.
That then extended to,
I started listening to a few podcasts.
There's the ABC Pineapple,
is it the Pineapple Project, I think a while ago.
There's also the She's on the Money podcast
that I listened to a little bit as well.
And that then got me into a few other apps.
So Andrew, I don't know if you use any of these apps
or know too many of them.
But I first started with Raise, a micro-investing app,
which I think in the US is known as Acorns.
There's another version.
Yep.
I know that one.
Yeah.
So I started using that last year
and then switched over to another app called Spaceship
this year.
But basically, just a way for people
to invest small amounts of money in different sort
of portfolios and ETFs and managed funds and I'm throwing all the lingo out there.
Do I really understand all of it?
Who knows?
Andrew looks happy.
It doesn't matter.
Exchange traded funds.
Yeah.
I mean, at this point, you're just making my research for the notes awesome.
So keep going.
And I'm also, so I've really tried to get Martin into, I get that he doesn't want to
do the, you know, budgeting apps and sort of tracking all of that.
But I've really tried to get the family into any of these micro-investment apps such as
Spaceship, because it's basically just like another savings account, but with potentially
higher gains.
And also there are referrals.
So if you sign up and I've referred you, then you get like five bucks and things like that.
And I've just really tried to get the family into it, and they're just not doing it.
Her referral code will be in the show notes.
I love her referral code.
He does.
He really does.
I'll give you my referral code and anyone is welcome to it.
- That's in the show notes.
- He really does.
- Although I will say that I'm not qualified
to give financial advice, so please don't.
Do your own research.
I've learned that from the podcast that I've listened to.
- I was gonna say, that seems like exactly what they say
at like the very end of all these commercials.
So that's perfect.
- Exactly, yeah, yeah.
But definitely, you know, look into it.
And speaking of super Andrew,
Spaceship also has their own super product as well.
- So many supers.
- Love it.
- Yeah, yeah.
So many options.
It's really cool. Yeah.
I hope we're not going to talk about crypto right now though.
No, I haven't. I have not dabbled and don't plan on it.
I just wrote a blog post the other day expressing my-
Praising it? Pretty comprehensive one I saw.
Well, I got fired up. I couldn't sleep one night.
I've been to that conference and there was too much crypto talk and my bullshit-o-meter was going crazy.
I'll have to read that. Please direct me to wherever.
That'll be in the show notes, Jason will sort that out.
On it.
Wonderful.
Jodie's been really the second gen Feldfoot as I've said, because she has better coordination,
more musical talent.
She's way more attractive than I am for a start.
So it's kind of like everything was enhanced for the most part.
Is that fair, Jodie?
Look, I think you're selling yourself a bit short there.
Very good.
There's definitely a few, you know, elements that I am the improved version but I think,
you know, intellectually you're superior to me and I'll always be striving for that.
I don't know about that.
It's been a bit of a sore point throughout my life actually.
I may have completed my year 12 assignment on basically living in a sibling shadow and
the effects of birth order and sibling rivalry.
So, if that gives you an insight into my childhood.
Well, look how big the foot is.
do you get out of a shadow that big? It's huge. Exactly. Impossible. That's been my life, Jason.
I'm seeing the shadow over here. That's how big it is, okay? Everybody thinks it's just
because I'm on the other side. No, it's actually sunny out. I just have no sun because of his
shadow. So that's what's happening there. Mm-hmm. Well, we like you. So as much as Martin
may, you know, try to push you down, we're here for you. Just to preface, Martin is a fantastic
Older brother and you know one of my best friends so I don't want to be to to mean to him.
Yeah but we can check the blinking.
Yeah he's a good guy he just you know like slice things his way.
So can you can you just casually unlock that room that you've locked it your sister.
I want to touch on the music thing real quick, wrap back around. You play instruments. Martin,
I don't think does, but he's very into music. He's like a music freak. He uses an iPod in
2021. So did that start for you as a kid playing instruments? And he just was like, eh, or
did you do this later? Because that seems like you would have both done that as siblings.
Yeah, yeah, so let's let's get into the the childhood hobbies of Martin and Jodie and do a bit of a comparison
I think it's it's quite interesting. Yeah, paint me a picture. Yeah, so
Martin I believe he sort of did drama and things like that. I also did that so, you know, we we shared that interest
theater performing
At a young age Martin was gifted a trumpet from our aunt who who plays the trumpet and he dabbled in that
but it never really took off. But then at age nine, I started taking guitar lessons,
because a friend of mine's dad did guitar lessons, and I thought it would be cool.
And then I started playing drums age 12 as well, after a few years of begging. And I don't know
how old you were, Martin, but you actually also started taking guitar lessons and played.
- I did some, yeah, that was during high school. - Yeah, yeah. And I'm sorry, Martin,
but I have to be honest, I think music was the thing that I pursued because I was like,
"Oh, wow, I have this over Martin. Sucked in. This is my thing."
So, that's why I kind of pursued it.
Yep. And I do.
But I was, Martin makes jokes about me being the more coordinated,
Feld sibling as well, because I played soccer for many
years, skated and surfed and did all these other things,
which were, you know, probably more typically associated with male dominant
activities whereas Martin was you know at family events telling tragic romances
and doing soliloquies and the like. He still does to this day. Even worse I
played tennis and golf as a child and did not end up wealthy. Oh you had every
opportunity. Should have been using that finance app telling you. That's it.
There you go. Yeah if you did golf and tennis and it still didn't happen this
is not that was not for you. Don't worry there's lots of money in podcasting. It's
It's huge.
You should see my Spendy app.
It's got all the details of all the income.
- But yeah, Jodie was always more coordinated than I was,
still is, and yeah, I think it's fair to say
that I was very forceful about my music
and listening and musical taste,
but Jodie actually transformed it into creation.
And even still, I think at family events,
we talk a lot about music and where things are heading,
and I generally get annoyed about Spotify
for a good 10, 15 minutes and then try to move on and have something to eat and shut up.
That sounds like you.
So, Jodie, who's your favourite artist or band or singer?
Oh, that's really too difficult to answer.
Martin did very much influence my musical tastes growing up and also just family and what we were listening to.
So, I grew up listening to a lot of Coldplay and Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age and things and
Powderfinger and Silverchair and other things like that, that Martin was listening to.
And then he kind of went off into his more atmospheric, interesting Sigur Rós sort of stuff.
Oh, yeah. Good, Martin.
So, yeah.
You just got Andrew approval.
Thank you. I like a bit of ethereal post-rock from Iceland.
He does, yeah. I think my sort of tastes and things like that have definitely broadened.
and working in music, you are introduced to a lot of different genres and artists and things like that.
So, I think it's far too difficult to pinpoint any particular artists that are my favourite at this stage.
Okay. I'm going to get you off that fence, Jodie.
Have you got your phone with you right now?
I do.
Okay.
Can you open your music app of choice?
Can we get a phone?
It's a...
It's an 11 product red.
Okay.
Can you open your music app of choice?
I can. Can you go to your recently played list?
Oh, no.
And tell us, what's the last song that you listened to?
Yeah. Oh, this is going to be bad.
Where is my recently played?
It was Dare to Dream by John Farnham and Olivia Newton-John from the Sydney 2000 Olympics, wasn't it?
That would be so...
I've found my recently played.
Right. It's actually an album that I recommended to Martin yesterday.
an Australian artist called Nick Murphy, who just released a new album called
Taking the Roses. He's also known as Chet Faker.
Oh, I've heard that name.
There you go. That's my recently played.
Okay. So wait, that was the one you showed Martin.
What's the one just prior to that, that you were listening to by yourself?
That's what we really want to know.
By myself was the song Lenny by Stevie Ray Vaughan,
which I was learning on guitar.
Okay.
Or have been for some time. So there you go. And then before that
was a song from The Incredibles, the movie, because I saw it on an Instagram
meme and I thought the music was great and wanted to go and listen to it.
Kronos Unveiled is the song.
So, there you go.
Speaking of TikTok.
And then before that, sorry, I'm going to have to jump in here because I'm going to-
She's feldfooting.
I'm feldfooting.
I'm feldfooting and I'm doing this because right before that in my Recently Played
is one of another strong interest and passion of mine that Martin has not taken on. And he's,
you know, going to be like, here we go again, she's talking about it. But right before that,
in my recently played is a playlist of songs from the show Better Call Saul that I compiled.
So, the spin-off series of Breaking Bad that I've been desperately trying to get Martin to watch,
and he has not. That got to the point where earlier this year, Martin recommended that I watch
Shmigadoon, which he knew that I would enjoy.
Yeah, the old Skadoogle.
Love a bit of Shmigadoon.
Don't we all?
But I got to the point where I was so frustrated by Martin not watching Better Call Saul that I said I would not watch Shmigadoon until he watched Better Call Saul.
And of course, I just caved and watched it.
Who won?
You did.
Cutting off your nose to spite your face, that one.
Are you allowed to watch the Saul one before you watch Breaking Bad?
Is that not like a sequel?
I having watched both I watch Breaking Bad first I would say watching Breaking Bad first is probably a better payoff because all the Easter eggs and stuff in Better Call Saul will make more sense but having said that you could watch Better Call Saul first.
It's its own standalone show and having said that you could watch Better Call Saul first and then if you went to watch Breaking Bad it would have the opposite effect of oh now everything is tying together so you know you could go either way.
I struggle with Saul. I watched all of Breaking Bad and loved it. And I watched the first season of Saul and I could just never get into a rhythm with it. I just couldn't. I enjoyed it in the moment, but I never was desperate to watch the next one. And so I've got, I've just never gotten around to watching the subsequent seasons, even though everybody says it's really good. And I know I would like it in the moment, but it just doesn't bubble up enough.
Yeah, it's a very different show. It's not as action packed and it's much more, for lack of a better word, slow burner.
It's more about the character development.
But I would say, honestly, controversial opinion.
I think Better Call Saul is like maybe even better than Breaking Bad if you stick with it.
She has said that to me before and I accept it.
And I haven't watched it, not out of protest, but because Natasha never actually finished watching Breaking Bad.
So to invest in a long series with...
He did find the time to rewatch Battlestar Galactica by himself, might I add.
So.
Priorities.
That was imperative.
That was imperative.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I've seen neither, so I will trust your judgment.
You want apps.
We got apps.
It's Hemispheric Apps.
I want to circle back to App Corner, App Roundrag.
How many times do we have to reinsert your theme, Andrew?
Your little.
Jeez, that's going to be a lot.
It's Hemispheric Apps.
Who's editing?
- Oh, Martyn will fix this up.
'Cause you said you came in with a couple of apps.
I don't wanna leave you like lost on those.
So you said you had,
I think it should be called Savey, not Spendy,
but you've got Spendy.
- That's a fair point.
- Okay, so what's next on the app?
- Are we gonna workshop some names for these apps too?
(laughs)
- Send a note to the developers.
Yeah, so I started with Spendy,
then I mentioned Rays and Spaceship.
So they are two apps that I have used.
I'm not using Raze anymore, but I am using Spaceship.
So that's an app that I...
- Spaceship.
- Spaceship Voyager.
I think it's Spaceship Voyager is the full title.
- Why is that the name of an app
that has to do with finance anything?
That's because you're taking off to planet money?
- Probably.
- Is the backing track for the Spaceship Voyager ad
done by Mr. Alex Canyon by any chance?
- Oh.
- Should be.
a good product placement or what is that?
Were they, yeah, okay.
- That would be, yeah.
- We'll note that down for Alex.
- I think they've just gone with the space theme.
Like I guess the exponential growth
and shooting off into other--
- Exponential growth, there's another term, there it is.
Do we do year over year growth yet?
Has that come up?
I can't remember if we talked about that yet.
Everybody loves a good YOY.
EOFY, we got the EOFY, everyone knows about that now.
Happy Eofi.
I did listen to that this morning.
Sorry, Jodie, you're still trying to talk about your other apps, weren't you?
I know. I just keep ruining everything that you're doing.
No, that's cool. Yeah. So Spaceship, they have the different sort of investment portfolios.
And one, the original one is called the Origin Portfolio.
And then they have another one called Universe, which is basically they're investing in companies that they see, you know, being the future.
So it's got all that kind of theme running.
And then they've got the earth portfolio, which is a more sustainably minded
portfolio for sustainable investing.
That's the NFT one.
Maybe.
No.
I don't think so.
I'll just go on with you there.
So they're the main sort of apps that I wanted to mention, but then the last one
is also an app called get reminded, which I'm sure there are different versions of,
of this sort of idea out there, but it's basically just an app where you can put
in all your bills for the year and it gives you sort of a countdown reminder of when they're
going to be due and how much in total you'll be spending in bills and it gives you a breakdown
of all the categories such as you know car, insurance, electricity, internet, subscriptions,
etc, etc.
So I only actually started using that one this year because after five years of tracking
all my spending and then you know having a mortgage I realised okay my spending is going
change. I've got bills now that I didn't have before and I need to keep track of them. I
just wanted one place that that could all sort of be. So that's also a really good app
that I would recommend to people. And it's got different breakdowns. It's got the breakdown
of counting down how many days till your bill is due and then the breakdown of expenditure
as well.
Please tell me that you use some kind of application to track tasks from day to day. Please tell
me.
I don't actually.
Damn it. I was really hoping that we could drive another one into Martin on that. But
Yeah, the long shot but I had to try yeah, there are only certain
Aspects of my life that I do like to track that much so I do use the reminders app just on the iPhone
To just set reminders of general things. I have a specific work one as well
But yeah, this kind of very specific tracking is only really taken off in the financial
Personal finance part of my life rest of your life. You're just like whatever it's gonna happen
Yeah, kind of.
What's going on tomorrow?
I don't know.
I mean, I use a calendar and things like that, but, you know, it's kind of funny.
And I don't know if Martin has any comments about this, but I think...
He does.
He has a comment for everything, really.
But I think people in my life have found it interesting how on top of things I am at work
and with personal finance and stuff, but then in other areas, I'll just forget to do things.
However, having said this, and I probably shouldn't say this on the podcast, so feel
free to edit it out if you would like to Martin, but Martin forgot to pay his,
he forgot to register his car one year.
And, um, so that's where things like this get reminded app comes
in handy.
And the insurance.
And the insurance. There you go. I wasn't going to give too much away. Um, but
yeah, there you go.
This is where my comment comes in.
The funny thing is that I completely forgot. And then I managed to get in right.
And renew the whole thing. And service New South Wales said, you know,
Martin for being such a responsible driver we've given you a discount. Come on!
It's true I'm a responsible driver but I was forgetful at that particular point
of my life so I was rewarded for my tardy renewal. I'm similar to Martin in
the sense that if I didn't have that app like too many life admin things going on
I can't think about it don't think about it you know so. The biggest concern for
day-to-day is have I had my afternoon fruit and nuts? That's the big thing.
Are there any questions you may have about Martin that you'd like me to answer?
Oh, hell aye.
There are many.
Or a fellow family or anything like that?
There are many, many questions about what goes on over there in his world. But I feel like I've
hit the line of how much I can just kind of crap all over Martin in this episode. I just feel like
like there's been a very heavy amount of shoveling toward the little box that he's in on my screen.
So I'm going to bow out gracefully and say thank you for the info you did give. We may back channel
a little bit behind his back with you later, but he doesn't need to know that.
I think Andrew has more. Thank you, Jason.
Well, he's the Australian between the two of us, him and me, so he would be glad to just,
you know, shovel on some more.
- I do have a question.
It's going back in time a little bit.
So what's the age gap between the two of you?
- Whoa, Doc, that's a lot of personal information.
- Four years?
- OpSec.
- Yes. - Okay, okay.
When Martin was younger,
was he super possessive of his toys?
Would he let you ever touch, play, look at his toys?
Or was he like, hands off, they're mine,
go away, annoying system?
- I have them color coded in alphabetical order,
don't mess it up.
- See-- - They're mint in box.
- Mint in box.
That was me.
I had so many toys that were still in the,
I love the packaging more than the toy, but go ahead.
- Now see, Jason, you've said you don't wanna answer,
sorry, ask any more questions
because you feel like enough has been heaped on Martin,
but I'm actually here to dispel any myths as well
about Martin.
And I would like to say that Martin was
a very generous and kind brother.
He, I shared all, he shared all his toys with me
Is she reading off a script?
I can't tell.
She's blinking again.
Look at those eyes.
That's a call for help.
Okay.
Sorry, continue reading.
I've not been coached into this, but I also was quite the tomboy growing up.
So, Martin would have a lot of trains, cars, things like that, and he would share all of
them with me.
There's also footage of Christmas when we were young.
I think I was about two and Martin was about six, and he got some Star Wars toys.
And I'm sitting there going, "Star Wars!"
And then we're, you know, shooting each other with these-
- That's fantastic.
- Laser guns and things like that.
So, and I always really looked up to Martin as well.
So all his sort of interests I was sort of into.
And yeah, so no, he was very kind and generous.
He wasn't super possessive of things.
- Okay, follow up.
- I'm sorry if that's not the answer you wanted.
- It is the answer, that's fine.
But I have a follow up.
Who set the rules of games?
- Okay, I think you'll enjoy this story.
Growing up, we had an Xbox and then an Xbox 360.
I don't know if you've spoken about this before, Martin,
but Martin liked to play games like Halo and Splinter Cell
and things like that.
And I, oh, and going even further back,
we also used to play Wolfenstein.
I think you may have mentioned this, Martin.
And there were a few games that Martin enjoyed playing
and I just sat there and watched him play.
And to me, it was like watching a movie.
And I used to click the space bar for him
or do things like that to open doors,
but I really enjoyed it.
So I wouldn't say that was necessarily rule setting
because Martin did offer and say,
"Do you wanna play as well?"
And sometimes I would, but he was typically better
at the sort of shoot 'em up games.
So having said that, when it came to rules,
I would say I'm more competitive than Martin
and more of a sore loser as well, actually.
So I kind of also set some rules back in the day.
- So you're the one flipping the Monopoly board.
That's you.
- 100% have done that before.
- Yes.
- And she loves Monopoly.
She would crush a particular friend in high school
who she invited over pretty much
just to destroy with Monopoly.
And might I add as well,
it's been a bit of a funny recurring story with our aunt,
I'll name her Francine,
that yes, I like things my way,
but she would often laugh that when Jodie was a kid,
that were downstairs in the rumpus room and Jodie would turn to her and say,
we're playing, we're playing soccer or basketball. It's your choice.
But pick basketball or I will hurt you.
It's one of those. That's what we're doing.
I gave her the choice. You know, I don't see what's wrong with that.
The answer is always basketball.
This may seem a bit random or out of the blue, but Andrew,
in terms of things that you've added recently,
Manually to your budgeting and your transactional history was one of the items that you added recently a packet of state daddys
I saw those and I haven't bought them
But I was mightily impressed by it. Oh what Andrew do you wanna explain to Jason since you're actually from the state?
Okay, so our premier premier of the state Mark McGowan
has a
extraordinarily high popularity rating and he sort of
People in the state really appreciate the hard line he took in terms of closing our borders because WA probably one of the few places in the world only place in the world maybe has basically been covered free for 18 months.
There's not been any community transmission has been just nothing but people can walk around safely and so he's held in very high regard and he became he sort of became me me fired.
And he became sort of the state daddy right because he looked after all sounds that sounds terrible he looked after all the citizens you know he was he was a giant daddy.
Look after his own politician right.
That's not an apple politician this kind of high regard one guy actually got a tattoo of mark mcgowan on his leg or something.
Giant portrait of martin mcgowan.
Um but more recently there's a local artist created a.
Box of cereal like a cereal box graphic designed and called them state daddy owes and it had a caricature of martin mcgowan on the front with his bowl of cereal.
And a big spoon in his hand and given the big thumbs up at the same time.
I'm a little bit disappointed because I thought Martin said steak daddy owes and I was thinking it was gonna be some kind of meat pie special edition thing but.
That's next in their merchandising plan for the government if you buy if you buy a limited edition box of steak daddy owes it is actually fruit loops.
Wait these are actually for sale they didn't just do like a.
Yes it's a thing.
Yeah you can get the thing.
I've not heard of this either Jason so I'm right here with you.
So I just want to point out you've closed the borders. Good job. No COVID cases. Good job
But you've all gone collectively insane within those borders during this time. Is that fair to say?
Yes, okay. Fair to say.
State daddios. I mean just now that you brought it up. Let's all do a quick top five cereals while we're here
We've got time
Fruit loop for me is pretty high up there. Actually, I do
- Do you have Fruit Loops?
- I'm talking junk cereal here, right?
So this is like top five junk cereals,
nothing that provides any nutritional value.
In your world, it would be the half to one star
on your five star food scale, right?
Or zero stars, which one of the things you sent me
was zero stars, so that was--
- Three Andrew thumbs, whatever.
- So Fruit Loop is pretty high, I would say.
I'm not a big fan of chocolate cereal.
I'll eat it sometimes, but I think you really can't go wrong
and have as your number one, a cinnamon toast crunch.
- Is that a Pop-Tart?
- You don't even have cinnamon toast crunch.
- Damn it.
- No, sorry.
- Son of a (beep)
- Doesn't work at all.
- I like cinnamon, so I'm with you.
I feel like- - It's a winner for me.
- I feel like that'd be good.
- Sounds good.
- Oh, man. - I tried it.
- See, for me, the top junk cereal is actually one
that doesn't outright lie about its health benefits,
but kind of presents itself
that it could be a healthy alternative,
and that is the Kellogg's Crunchy Nut, right?
- Wow, they put the nut in there like,
oh, nuts are good for you.
Yeah.
- It's essentially like a cornflake
that has been enhanced with more sugar
and honey and flavoring, right?
So you go, oh, this is kind of like an enhanced,
you know, culinary cornflake,
but it's really just a sugar fest.
And they also have some ridiculous ads.
And so it's even got to the point where when I visit Natasha's family, if I ever say the word delicious, my father-in-law, he always says tall Jan's malicious because there was a crunchy nut ad where someone was saying the crunchy nut was delicious.
But over the cubicle wall in the office setting where the ad took place, there was a woman who was known as Tall Jan because her name was Jan and she was tall.
And she misheard them saying, do you just say tall Jan's malicious?
And then a fight ensues.
Wow.
That's my memory.
There's another thing for the show notes.
- That is, thank you YouTube in advance
for someone putting that on there,
'cause damn, making a note.
- Tall Jan's malicious?
- Tall Jan, got it.
- Okay.
- Jodie, favorite cereal?
- Cereal wasn't a huge thing in our household, Martin.
We did dabble in the Cocoa Pops,
so I grew up loving Cocoa Pops,
but just recently actually, when I moved out,
because I'm very lazy with food preparation,
I got on the cereal train,
And I discovered this cereal called cheeky monkey, cheeky monkeys or something like that.
I just saw this, I'm scrolling through Woolworths right now and it's here in front of-
Are you thinking messy monkeys?
Messy monkeys. That's it.
Sorry. There you go.
And the only reason I got it was because the packaging is just really cute.
It's really nice.
It works.
There's a chocolate crunch flavor.
It's a nice sort of pastel blue with a nice little messy monkey on there.
And it's actually made of legumes.
So it's actually like, you know, the health star rating is actually pretty high.
So I would say that doesn't qualify for this discussion, but as well as the messy monkeys, I've also really gotten back into Milo cereal, which is not healthy.
And there's also the Milo duo cereal, which is like there are some chocolatey ones and some vanilla ones.
And I'm quite into that.
Cadbury Topdeck is a cereal.
So you're not, you're not, this is not a self DIY cereal.
This is there's actually a Milo cereal like pre-packaged.
- Sharp cereal.
It cuts the roof of your mouth if you're not careful.
- That's how you know, it's good.
- And after you've had that you can enjoy your Milo ice cream.
- Yeah, that's good.
Jodie, I've got good news for you.
If you head down to Woolworths right now, they've got Missy Monkeys on special.
Just only $2.40 for a box.
That's cheap.
Save a $1.60.
- That's why I was living off it.
- It's practically half price.
- Brought to you by the fresh food people.
You like pretty much don't even have to log that in Spendy it's so cheap.
It's a source of protein.
I would still have to.
Hidden goodness.
And 4.5 health star rating.
Oh my goodness.
It's not cereal at all.
A messy monkey is a 4.5.
Yeah.
I can attest to this.
I've tried it after Jodie's recommendation.
Oh wait, Martin took a recommendation.
Fascinating.
What was the reverse?
Actually, it might have been Natasha.
I'm stuffing up this whole story.
It is delicious and it is healthy.
The milk on this box is so-
It looks more like coconut cream.
So white and thick looking.
Jodie, have you ever put half and half on your cereal?
I don't know what that is.
Oh, right.
This whole thing is...
(laughing)
What is that?
