Uh, you can take his place now. Jump on in there.
Here I am. Okay. Okay.
Oh, it's nice in the interrogation spot. Let's go.
First of all, so we just talked about the Keychron K1. You obviously have the K2.
Yes.
Did you have the K1 ever or did you start with the K2?
No, this is my first ever Keychron keyboard. I only got it a few months ago.
I've long sort of lusted after a clicky keyboard.
It's not quite as clicky as I'd like it to be.
I remember the old IBM ones that weighed about five kilos
and had like a phone cord coming off them.
Yeah, you could like chop a tree down with those things.
Yeah. Yeah.
I want a keyboard that clicks like that.
And this isn't it.
But hey, it clicks.
I don't like the fact the keyboard layout is weird and I end up pushing
Like this, it's got this button that kind of does like print screen,
sort of like screen grabby kind of, and I always push that by mistake.
And then I have to think,
does that go to your Apple laser writer or?
Yes. It doesn't actually, it's not really print screen. I don't know what it's like.
Screen capture, screenshot. Is that what it is? Yeah. It's annoying as all hell.
Cause I never want that button. And I always push it.
That was something on the K one. And I always hit the little, um,
before they added the firmware to lock it, I would always hit the little light
button on accident and it would change what the lights were.
And that was always drove me nuts because the,
I cycled all the way back to the one that I wanted. I do, you do the same Jason.
You cannot have the one you don't want. Yeah. Yeah.
I can't type up. What do you know? I'm just boring. Just boring.
You just lights on. That's all I want. And then I broke it. So now I don't have it.
Okay. Next question. Um, obviously, uh,
What the hell, what the hell are you doing with your doc?
Like, what is that about?
Why is it like, why?
Yeah, that doc, that doc has actually gotten a bit out of control.
Even after the screenshot, I looked at the doc and removed a few things from it.
I think it's COVID.
I've had to like live a dual life.
Your doc, your doc got COVID?
Your Mac has COVID?
Yeah, well it's got, it has to function as a, as a, I need a, I need a two doc mode.
I need like a, a work hours doc and an after hours doc, because I've got to have all
the Microsoft garbage hanging out there because I need that all the time.
It works.
Spreadsheets.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't let any of the Microsoft apps into my dock, even though they're some of the most
used apps.
I will spotlight that every time.
Do you remember when you first install it and it has the gall to put all that crap in
your dock by itself?
Error reporting.
Look at error reporting.
Everyone's favorite app.
Let's launch error reporting by mistake.
No one should ever be allowed to put things in your dock without asking.
That should be against the law.
Sorry, go ahead, Ed.
No, I agree.
Look, and that doc is a bit of a monstrosity.
I have tried a few different things.
I always sort of come back to it being on the left and always being shown.
I don't like a hiding doc.
But yeah, there's a few too many things on there right now, I admit.
I have pruned it since that screenshot.
For some reason, I had both PDF Expert and PDF Pen on the doc.
Why?
I don't know.
I got rid of one.
There's a couple of others I keep around.
But yeah, I guess that kind of is like my working toolkit, I guess I'd say.
So you guys, you guys both have your docks on the side, which means I'm assuming you both subscribe to this, to this false narrative that like, if it's on the bottom, you somehow like lose all this green real estate.
Is that are you on the side?
Because yes, that's untrue.
But I have it on the bottom, but it's hidden.
Oh, OK.
Oh, that's wrong for a whole nother reason.
Oh, my gosh.
All right.
I'm gonna just gonna I'm gonna go past the dock now. I will be here for hours
I honestly the the bottom hiding thing is only a result of switch glass because it lets me focus on the apps that are open
Without switch glass. I would be 100% visible all the time
So I get you and I'm sorry to have hindered you now
So I have a question for Andrew and I feel like some of the decisions here were made as aesthetic choices and preparation for the
Photo I want to ask whoa
That's quite the Wow, that's quite the allegation. They're saying that that someone would go through and clean everything before taking the photo
I think that's good leading the witness. I would never do that
There's no no
There are some things that actually seem quite natural like I can tell that you've got a very nice
Diagonal tilt to the way that the iPad is slightly off-screen like it's facing you but still within the photo
What I'm interested in is right now. You look quite normal. You're sitting upright
You're speaking to the microphone like a normal person
It's a quite a human stance, human posture.
But the distance that the keyboard is
from the edge of the table, are you like leaning over?
It looks like it's a long way away.
- It does, and to be fair, it is that long way away.
I am a lazy typist.
I can touch type.
I learnt that in primary school.
- Yeah.
- Or high school, whenever it was, a long time ago.
So I do touch type, but I'm lazy.
And I sort of just have my forearms resting
on the desk in front of the keyboard
rather than having my hands up,
wrists off the table as you should do when you touch type,
I just kind of like, meh, lay back, arms resting on the...
- So that's the natural position for the keyboard.
- That's pretty much it.
Maybe it would come forward an inch or two,
but no, yeah, right back like that.
That's how I roll.
- I'm impressed.
And how long are your arms?
I mean, I haven't actually seen you physically in person,
so this is maybe a very impressive arm length.
- Keep in mind, basketball players are probably like...
- Pretty long.
- That's right.
six foot four or something, he can dunk.
I used to be able to dunk effortlessly.
I can't do it anymore.
But yeah, I've got gangly arms, I think it's safe to say.
- Okay, that's a great answer.
And the blinds, you're following the same general policies
that I did or what's happening there?
- Yeah, I moved this desk to this location
about six months ago, thinking that natural light
with all the video conferencing we're having to do
during the day, natural backlighting would be better.
and it would be giving me something just a different angle.
I actually don't like it because I never get,
I'm either being blared out with Perth sunlight,
which is really bright, and I don't really have a view.
It's just kind of like a fence with a few plants,
there's a few plants hanging off
like a little planter box thing on the fence,
but it's pretty ugly.
So it's just a general disappointment out there.
(laughs)
- Raving review of Perth.
It's just a general disappointment out there.
- Wow.
Such melancholy.
Jason did you have any questions before we move to you?
I have loads more actually so much for Minnesota the little headphone stand. Yes. Does it have a light on it?
What is the little it looks like there's a little
Light on the front and if it is a light, what is it doing?
You're talking about that little dot right at the bottom of it. Yeah. Yeah, that is a little magnet
So you will notice oh they stick together sitting in front of it. They glue together. Yeah, this is the
I think it was called Gather.
It was sold online like a Kickstarter thing by Ugmonk.
And you could buy it as a kit, that whole thing in front underneath my monitor and those
pieces and they all magnetize and click into place.
Got it.
Do you put drinks on that thing?
I do on the coaster, yeah.
Two more questions, which means probably three.
There's a USB monstrosity, I will call it, back there.
There's a lot of USB things plugged into there, but I don't see a lot of USB things on the
desk.
Like where are all those going?
- Yeah, that USB thing's ugly.
I can't find a good spot for it.
Where is it going?
- 'Cause there's like, I see a keyboard.
I see the little pushy button thing and...
- Okay.
I've got, let's see if I can figure it out.
Stream deck.
- Yeah.
- UPS monitor.
- Okay, yeah.
- I think that might just be a loose cable
that can charge stuff.
Apple watch charger.
And something else that I, um, yeah, I don't know what that other one is.
Well, don't, I'm sure she's going to unplug anything right now.
I feel like that would be, I'm, I'm the whole, all the house lights are going to turn off.
If you touch that, everything's going to show.
They're all critical.
Probably.
Yeah, for sure.
Doing something and then a standby.
What Mac is this?
It's an iMac obviously.
And then the wallpaper.
What is that?
Is that a picture you took?
Is that a picture from somewhere?
I wish I could say I took that picture.
No.
So this is a, it was a set app application like wallpapers, something or other.
I'm not, I'm actually, I actually quit it again earlier today.
I quit it and went back to a boring desktop.
It's wallpaper something and it does the sort of 30 pictures over the time of the day.
So you see it, it synchronizes with the clock.
So at nighttime, that turns into a nighttime scene of the same picture.
It's actually quite a nice little app.
I didn't take the photo.
It is an iMac 2019.
What is it?
27 inch screen.
About this Mac.
Retina 5K, 3.1 gigahertz, core i5.
Got it.
Okay.
And you have lovely giant JBL speakers.
And then now, now is my final two questions.
I think I said I had four before.
Green your preferred post-it note color if not, what is and you have one of those little
Those little remotes that have like those little
Crappy buttons, you know, like I don't know what those are called where they're like
Plastic little domes. Yes. What is that controlling? These are great questions
Green is my favorite. It's my favorite colorful stop. So these actually though are not even real post-it notes
They're ripoff post-it notes that turned up from somewhere
Collins Debden
Dot-com dot au not real post-it. Don't stick they just
Apparently Martin has a thing for green as well with his 12 green pens. He just held up
I just pulled all the green pens out of the the cup holder thing and the little remote control with the buttony things
They are for my LED
Lighting array that I have stuck to the back. Ah, okay. So it's like a lot LED strip and
And, um, that has a million buttons cause it's not home kit.
It's just buttons on a remote control to change the colors.
You got your AirPods pro.
And I think that's, I think that's my final question.
I think.
Yeah.
Oh wait, no.
One more.
There's like a piece of paper stuck to the wall in the
background with bullet points.
What is that?
Is that like your daily?
Oh, yes.
Or something that was a, that was, that's a failed experiment.
Hang on.
Check it out. Hold on. Did you print screen on reminders?
It's it's an omni outliner file that's been printed. Thank you very much. You printed something
My desk is instead my desk is in stand-up mode. So I need to go crawling underneath just check what it says
That makes sense why you're so high up
It never made sense the keyboard shortcut reminders that I was trying to memorize and that would have been hat that would be handy
I was trying to remember one of those keyboard shortcuts earlier today and it's
Sticking right there. Huh. I think that's my my final accusation. Thank you, sir
