Music.
I got this new hand clap thing that I've installed I'm good you too I've still got mine.
Yep still works out.
So your mom and Jodie said hello.
Yeah, they said hello. They said hello to you too.
Do you do they do they check like do they do a follow up on that? Or is it just blind faith
that you'll actually say hello? Because what if you never said it?
They're pretty easy going about it. I think when they say say hello, it's just pass on my regards
or make sure to send my thoughts or something. And I don't normally super follow up with people,
but it reminds me of when I've walked past people whom I know and didn't notice at the time and then
afterwards they said "I waved at you and you didn't wave back" and I've thought well I didn't see you.
Oh this was years ago and it was at the local shopping center which is a hive of activity and
you should not go to if you only want to buy milk because you'll be out 90 minutes later.
So now whenever I go somewhere like that I'm on the lookout and it's like I will just wave at people
Even when they're not looking at me just so they can't say that.
Just a kiss.
Honestly, I've waved at people who haven't noticed at me or waved at people who I thought were that person, but wasn't sure because I hadn't seen them for ages and thought, I'm just going to be on the defensive here.
He's like the queen just walking down the street, just waving.
Pretty much.
That's what I envision, yeah.
Well, hello, Martin's family.
Somebody says to you, say hello to Joe.
Do you feel- I feel really worried.
If I don't say hello to Joe, I feel bad about it.
And I feel like I need to tick that box off.
It's a strong social convention in my mind.
Is that appropriate or am I overthinking it?
- Overthinking it.
If they're already in the position
where they're not even going to do the hello themselves
and they're already passing this off to a third party,
clearly the hello wasn't that big of a deal to begin with.
Cause they've already given it off to you to do.
They couldn't do it.
They've outsourced it.
Yeah.
I just, I don't think it was that important to them.
Yeah.
It's important to Martin's family.
So let's give that as due credit.
It's great that they're listening.
Helps our numbers.
Do you know when I was growing up, I, cause I had that American background.
I used to say, we were brought up to say mom, say hi mom.
Um, and I used to get all sorts.
a hassle at school for not saying mum, because the Australian way to say it is mum.
I didn't change that.
I stuck with mum until I was...
I still say it, but I have softened my stance and I say mum a lot more now.
Probably took it to my 30s, I would say, before I transitioned into the Australian way of
saying mum.
You're kind of saying the same thing both times to me.
Not terribly different.
And you're saying M-O-M versus M-U-M.
Your U's and O's basically the same.
No, look.
Might as well just get rid of one.
Mom.
And mum.
Mom.
Mum.
Well, now you're forcing it.
You're forcing that, though.
This is the Australian equivalent of, like, Mandarin inflections or something.
Now, that's about as complicated as we get.
That was a forced differentiation because you're trying to make them sound different.
rewind your podcast 15 seconds and listen back and they both sound pretty
much the same. You've kind of made a new one where like it's a U and an O sound
together. So it's probably what happens when you when you live here and you
influence wines. Can you say can you say mom just for the the proper
American expression? So you've just illustrated I'm not sure which one you
asking me to say because it sounded like the oh oh mom not mum mom one's a long vowel sound and
one's a short that's how i hear it mom mom mom mom and mom mom mom if you want to commit if you
want to commit andrew and convert yourself i think you just need to get in the habit of starting to
say mommy do you say do you say mother or mother mother i don't think i've ever heard anyone say
mother that sounds like a problem but we say but we say bother we don't say bother is this the
english analysis podcast now because i've got a lot of material ready if we're gonna have to
abandon the show notes at this point we got a huge influx of new listeners thanks to our
advertising deal and um they've tuned in for this so we should send a quick thank you for the
wonderful feature to manton and daniel of core intuition it was lovely to be featured and i know
you know, we get on with these guys and really like their work and we met on micro dot blog. So,
I was, I was certainly happy to be mentioned. I don't know about you too.
I, I don't, I don't have words to even, it's never would have crossed my mind that something
like that would happen where there would be an established, well-regarded thing in the world
that gave any amount of S's about this little old podcast
that we have right here, but I truly appreciate it.
So thank you to both of them.
- It's very cool.
- 'Cause I'm sure they listen to every minute
of every episode every week.
- It's very cool.
I mean, I've got micro.blog in my doc.
I've got MarsEdit in my doc.
They write those apps.
Like they're real genuine, proper internet people
And Mac people. Yeah. And they've talked about us. That's pretty cool.
It's fantastic. I, again,
massive thank you to both of them for that.
So if you're not listening to Core Intuition,
then our message is go and check them out too.
Coreint.org. .org. Yes. You don't see a lot of .orgs anymore.
No. I feel like that was like a thing for a while. A lot of,
a lot of .org action going on and then not, not anymore.
People are less organized this century. I think that's all it is. Too many things to do.
Was that intentional? You said everybody's less organized?
Dot org? Yes.
Of course it was.
OK, OK.
Assume that everything I say is born of a smartass tendency.
Now, we have an important item of follow up and I have my own little thing to add to this, but we have to hear from Andrew first.
For those who missed out on last week or need to catch up, Jason made a recommendation in
Media Corner to listen to Knife Party and by extension Pendulum, because they're related.
I had heard of them before, but I'm not a super fan by any means. Andrew was not aware that they
were from Perth, Western Australia. Andrew, have you done your homework and listened to
one or both of them? I listened to Knife Party and-
Before or after Pendulum?
It was after Pendulum. So Pendulum I just listened to a little bit of and I was like,
"Yes, it's fine. It's okay. Not really my cup of tea, but it's okay." And I like that ABC,
the ABC theme one is classic, but I think I'd still rather just listen to the original ABC
theme. It reminds me of many, many years ago, probably two decades ago, I actually bought a CD.
I think the guy's name was David Lowe. He produced the BBC World Service theme music,
And I bought a CD from BBC with that music on it.
It's really good.
Did you play it before you had anything to announce or share with others just to add an official air to it?
No, I just drive around.
I just drove around the car like delivering pizza, listening to BBC World Service music.
Gotcha.
But then I listened to Knife Party and immediately I felt like I'd grabbed a knife and stuck it in my ear.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's the right effect.
It really comes in strong.
It really smashed me over the head. I chose the Knife Party Essentials from Apple Music.
I chose to put it on and figure, "Well, where do you start? Start with the Essentials."
The Essentials, obviously.
It really, really did smash me over the head.
And my immediate reaction was, "This is horrible. I hate it."
I persevered for a couple of tracks.
And I started to sense...
It's the sort of music where it's a time and a place kind of music.
So if I just popped some acid and was in a club, that would be the time and the place.
It would be.
There's no other point in my life where I would think, why would I choose to sit down
and listen to this?
Well, I guess you don't sit down and listen to it.
That's probably not the way you do it.
No, this is not kick back in your lounge chair and relax kind of music.
So basically because of my lifestyle, never in my life am I going to have an opportunity
To be in the right environs where this music would be appropriate.
So I'll probably never listen again.
I didn't I didn't love it.
But I want to add to this because I went through the same essentials playlist to try to find one or a couple of the songs that I mentioned that I might have remembered because it was when all of my friends used to get drunk around me while I drank tea.
And that wasn't a joke.
The last episode that was serious.
I would sit there with tea because I just don't drink.
We know you got that.
It was serious.
Yeah.
A funny, serious statement.
Anyway, and the one that I found I went, that's the one they used to play all the time was Internet Friends.
Oh, yeah, which is just if you haven't heard it, it's just this really posh kind of almost robotic English woman speaking through it.
And at one point she exclaims, you blocked me on Facebook and now you're going to die.
And then it just drops.
And I thought, what on earth are people listening to?
while I just sat there drinking tea and they were mixing alcohol in one jug in the center of the table and
conveniently skipping me when it was someone's turn to drink it.
That's my association with that music. So when you say dropping acid, Andrew, I think you're right.
Not really my kind of music. I could see Jason
playing, having a hardcore gaming session and having that on in the background. That was, I did think about that.
He's nodding. Yeah. Oh, yeah, lots of acid, lots of games all the time.
That's just Tuesday.
And I don't know if this is a preview to Media Corner later on in the show perhaps, but
this was a week of catch up for me because not only did I listen to a bit of Knife Party,
I watched a lot of Matrix movies. I've watched them all.
Are we going there right now?
I don't know. I don't know if it's on the agenda, the run sheet. I don't know if we've got the
Media Corner music queued up.
Oh, actually, we can't go to that yet because it's not the next item on the agenda.
Good point.
The next item on the agenda is unannounced trivia corner.
- I have a feeling. - Boom, 2022 edition.
- Oh man, it's back. - How stoked are you guys?
- Oh geez. - For 2022?
- Do we get an update on the scores ever for last year? It's just, no.
- Maybe. - Maybe.
- We'll see how well you do with these two questions. No, here's the thing.
Can I let you guys in on a little secret if you promise not to tell anyone?
Sure. Okay. You guys are tied right now. Seriously? Yeah. I was so pissed because I wanted to
have a grand winner at the end of 2021 and you guys screwed that up and tied so I couldn't
do anything. So now we're going into sudden death. All right. 2022 unannounced trivia
corner here we go ladies and gentlemen question number one what was the name of
the first Android phone hardware was it a HTC dream be Google pixel see Samsung
droid or D LG g1 I'm gonna go first and I'm gonna choose the first option was
- Is that HTC?
- HTC Dream, is that what we're going with, locking it in?
Okay, Andrew's locked in.
- I will go for the LG G1,
although I have a feeling I'm not correct.
I have this feeling that maybe it's that touch screen thing
that technically came out before the iPhone,
but wasn't the same multi-touch or something.
I don't know.
- I know, I'm sure it probably didn't come out there,
like at the same time it did here,
much like everything seems to be.
Do you, I, this is a little tangent, tangent. Okay. Got it. Tangent.
Do you remember when that happened there? Like when the first,
when that very first wave of these devices started happening?
Are you saying touchscreen phones as we know them today?
Yeah. Like the first Android phone, like did it launch it, you know, JB HiFi,
and you can go look at it or whatever. Do you remember that?
My memory of it is maybe you remember better Android, I don't know.
But my memory of it is that there were the smartphones
with hard, you know, built-in keyboards for years and years,
like all through the noughties.
And then when the iPhone came out in 2007 in the US,
we didn't get it until the following year
officially with the 3G.
So it was really 2008 onwards
that everything went iOS touch screenified.
And then I remember that all the Android things
kind of followed or came out around the same time.
- Oh, so you guys launched with the 3G.
You never actually had the first one.
- I got it like at the beginning of the launch 3G, yeah.
- Oh, interesting.
Okay, I didn't realize that.
- Hannah got one before I did
'cause I think I had my iPod touch
and I was happy with that
and my work was paying for a Blackberry.
So I didn't need to get another phone.
But I think Hannah got a 3GS, I think was the first.
- That was the one where a lot of Australians jumped on board
'cause I remember driving people mad in 2007
about the iPhone and people went, "Yeah, whatever."
one or two people came back from overseas with, you know, they kind of made an iPhone work here.
And then the 3G came out. I and another friend got one. Everyone went, "Oh, what's this? This
is what you've been talking about." 3GS came out. Everyone got one.
All right. And tangent, question two.
Oh, yeah.
Are you ready?
In what year was the German expressionist horror film Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror, released?
Was it 1911, 1922, 1875, or 1931? Andrew? 1931. Okay. I'll say 22. Okay. Can you say it like
Richie Benne? And end of unannounced trivia corner. There's no theme for that, by the way.
I'm a little upset that there's no theme music. There's your mission. So if anyone is, you know,
sitting around thinking about Eurovision or whatever if we could get a theme for
unannounced trivia corner that would be pretty rad. Andrew do you want to give
your Richie impersonation because it's really you who wants to do it. It's Chew
for 22 here at Sydney Cricket Ground. Wow what was that? That's definitely gonna
become a repeated sound effect for no reason. Richie Benno is the doyen, the
The past doyen of Australian cricket.
Can we replace the hand clap sound with that?
Right. Anyway, sorry.
Richie Benner corner, unannounced trivia corner.
What's the next corner? What corner are we looking at?
Jason, did you add something about the home row?
That piqued my interest.
Oh, the home row.
Yeah. I was thinking about this the other day, how I'm sure anyone that's roughly in the age range of any of us remembers some kind of typing class in school.
Maybe they put like a box over your hands or something and to test you and there's always a home row.
You got it. You got to have the home row. You know, it's all about that home row.
Well, I'm a horrible typist. I'll admit that.
Are we doing another typing test here? Because we've done this before.
Okay.
People can revisit that in the show notes for sure.
I was just thinking there's so much emphasis on mobile devices now and thumb typing.
that the home row doesn't mean anything
in terms of thumb typing.
So how long until that is not a thing?
Much like how, I feel like handwriting is probably not,
I'm obviously not in school learning that now,
but, and maybe Andrew, you have some insight into this,
but handwriting, I have to imagine,
is not as emphasized in school as maybe typing is now,
given where we're at with technology.
So I'm wondering if Home Row, does that start to go away
as we get into these screen-based keyboards
where there's no tactile feel today anyway,
maybe there will be in the future.
And pencil input and things like that
where you're writing and then it's turning into text.
Do we need Home Row?
Is that really gonna be a thing for very much longer?
- Can I interrupt for a moment?
Just for listeners who aren't as technically inclined
or maybe do type a lot, but never heard this term.
When we say home row,
we're really talking about that middle row with the keys,
A, S, D, F, J, K, L, semi-colon,
where you would rest your eight fingers
as a base for touch typing.
- That's why you have the little nubbies
on the F and the J for your fingers, right?
So you can see where you're at.
So I don't know.
It's like, obviously the keyboard itself has been around
since the beginning of time,
and that hasn't changed at all.
So maybe home row is here to stay,
But I think the transition to screens and pencil inputs,
and even voice input, is maybe what's going to change that.
I don't know.
It was a thought that came up.
And I was curious if either of you
had ever thought about things like the home row,
and does it really serve a purpose anymore?
As a touch typist, I love me a home row.
Nothing makes me feel more at home than feeling
the little nubbies under my index fingers.
Fun fact, some keyboards at a certain point in time
had the little nubbin under your second finger
way back when.
That was a thing for a while.
I think it was a UK thing.
That's not where the little nubbin belongs.
It should be on the index finger.
The thought that people wouldn't take the time
to invest in touch typing knowledge worries me.
But you're right.
It's like, who's gonna, I ain't got no time for that.
It'll probably be the prevailing wisdom
as we move forward.
So maybe you're right and auto correct will probably become more of a thing across all the platforms.
So I think not even home rows typing will not become a thing and then spelling
might not become a thing anymore because auto correct will fix it. Although the way the Apple's
going at the moment with their auto correct would probably make it worse. I thought I might get that
out of you. They're not doing that so well at the moment. Yeah so I hadn't given any thought but I
I see your argument.
And when you talk thumb typing, yeah,
Homer is a total waste of time.
It just makes me wonder if the keyboard in general
makes any sense anymore with digital as we move forward
and having, you know, like the thumb,
does the standard keyboard layout under my thumbs
make any sense at all?
Or is it strictly just because that's the way
it's always been?
Would it be better to have them in, you know,
weird circle shapes in, you know,
eight different circles of letters for my thumbs
to attack. I don't know. It just feels like there's a transition that's actually going to maybe happen in the keyboard type input.
And maybe we just say, forget keyboards.
Everything's voice now.
I hope not. My brain doesn't work when I have to engage voice typing.
I can't do it.
Well, and it changes everything, right?
like your whole, your inner voice is gonna be changed
because now the way you're thinking about it
is in a spoken word versus typing.
It just is two very different forms of communication
from your brain outward.
At least that's what I feel.
The way you speak to people is very different
than the way you type,
which is why people get in trouble so much
with the way they type things
and having them be received in a way
that is not the same way as you typed it.
It's just too, it's like the neurons get crossed
and things just change.
But yeah, thumb typing to me is the weird one.
And I also wonder how many weird,
horrible hand problems I'm going to have
when I'm very old from holding these stupid little devices
with my pinkies and this weird claw shape
to work as an easel to hold this stupid phone up.
I hate thumb typing.
If there's anything of any length at all,
I will avoid the thumb typing
and wait till I can get to a proper keyboard.
but I'm old.
- Okay, weird tangent.
I'm tangenting, tangent, ugh.
Going on tangents today.
I kind of hate mobile devices more and more every day.
Like a phone size one.
I'm okay with like the iPad size,
but I'm kind of wondering if maybe
I don't want to have a phone anymore.
And that sounds insane, but I don't know.
I just, the more I have one, the more annoyed I am with it.
And it has nothing to do with, you know, iOS, iPhone, Android, whatever.
It's just the idea of the phone device.
It just feels so compromised in every single way.
Even though they can do amazing things all the time, I find more and more that I'm
like, I'll just wait to do that till I get home.
I'll add to that and I'll add to that and I'll tie it to the Home Row thing that you
opened with. I'm a huge fan of the Home Row.
I think I've mentioned on the podcast before
that I learnt touch typing at school
with the whole tea towel over your hands thing.
And I've found that that has very heavily influenced
the way that I think,
I grew up doing handwriting at school
and naturally that slows you down
and it's different from typing
and dictating with your voice into software.
They're all very different.
But I find that that influence of the keyboard
from an early age ended up shaping even the way
that I do thumb typing on the phone.
So I have auto-capitalization and auto-correct turned off,
which might sound like madness to people,
but I found that I liked the idea of having something
that didn't capitalize automatically
because my Mac doesn't do that.
No matter where I go, I never have anything
trying to guess what I'm writing or slowing me down
or altering the way that the input works.
So I like that if I go to the iPad, the Mac, the phone,
whatever I have set up, it's the same everywhere.
And then getting to your tangent about mobile devices, I think that kind of, they started
off as smaller items of convenience.
You know, you used to have to synchronize to an iPod.
Now you don't have to do that.
It's just there in the streaming app that you use.
You used to write something down on a post-it note and stick it somewhere and then make
sure you didn't lose that or lose your address or notebook or something.
It's all in there.
So it was doing a lot of things.
Yeah, I just I feel like more and more the only reason I take a phone with me anywhere I go
is because I want the camera. Because I would leave the house without my phone all day long,
but the problem is the camera. I just I want to have a camera on me at all times.
And I can't do that any other way than with the phone. And then it just feels like everything on
the phone is, I don't know, I feel like I'm complaining now about something that is probably
one of the most revolutionary things that's ever happened in all of humanity. But it just feels
like everything it does is hampered in a way that would be probably better if I just waited and did
it later. Well, this is where I think some people have kind of gone, you know, who actually uses
screen time or that doesn't make sense. A lot of the time I think screen time is sold as this thing
to help cut down on your Instagram hours or something. I've actually found screen time
incredibly useful to turn what you just said was your complaining Jason to maybe a positive.
I've used screen time to try to understand what I actually do on different devices,
not how long I'm wasting, but what I do on each one. Because where I was talking about consistency
with the keyboard before, you know, I wanted always to behave the same way. I used to think
that way with the apps on everything. I thought, oh, if the apps on the iPhone, then I should
probably have it on the iPad as well, because then I could pick it up there and then I can do it on
on the Mac and then I found,
well actually I'm never personally playing games
on my iPhone.
I'm never really reading this on the Mac.
And then I realized, huh, screen time is showing me that.
So let's reduce what's on the iPhone
to make it really important or meaningful
or less fatiguing.
Like you said, it's the camera, it's tot.
It's that quick web browsing or sending a Discord message
whereas the Mac is for this and the iPad is for that.
So I don't know if this is useful for listeners as well
but use something like screen time to cut out
all the rubbish that you don't actually do on your phone
and make it the important minimal thing
that actually helps you in your day.
- One of the things I've been wanting to try for a while
is the different configuring it
so different home screens load
with the different focus modes that you can set up.
But it just seems like such hassle to get that done
that I keep procrastinating on it.
- That's where I think just cutting down
on the number of things,
that's where I think just cutting down
number of things on your phone actually makes you like your phone more. It makes it less of a first
world luxury problem. Yeah, I think I guess what triggered this was the iPad mini because it,
like if I'm at home, I much rather would pick that up and use that as my device than my phone
because it just does things. I just feel like it's a better device for basically everything I'm
doing. But what I did with that is I did exactly like you said, I don't just have it mirrored
to my larger iPad. It's just it's got different stuff on it and it doesn't
have certain things installed and if I want to do that other thing well then
I'll go do that other thing on another thing somewhere else. We're obvious
outliers because most people would say they need their phone for Instagram,
Facebook, TikTok, you know the social world and we're not really a part of
that world are we? Love me some messages on the Mac. It's an equal counterpart to
that of the iOS application except it is not. I'm confused a little bit about
messages on the Mac in that it is supposed to be the same app right
because it's is that one of the catalyst ones? Yeah it is now yes. Why isn't it the
same then. I don't understand. I thought this was supposed to make it the same.
It's just seems so different. None of the plugin, uh, not plugins.
What are they called? Um, the apps, the apps don't, they're not there.
Um, whenever, this is my favorite thing.
So whenever you do a workout with like the Apple watch, right.
And you get the little, uh, like we're all Apple watch,
fitness, what is it, fitness friends, I don't know what it's even called.
So, we're that.
We're activity sharing or fitness sharing, yeah.
Sure.
So, you complete a workout, I get a cool little nicely stylized box that says a
little overview of what you did and I can reply and say, you know, great work or I
can say try harder, whatever.
So, that's cool.
That works great on the watch, works brilliantly on the phone, comes through
as that nice little box.
What does it do on the Mac?
Well, if you look at the messages on the left side,
it comes through as, let me actually read this to you
because I took a screenshot of it.
It comes through as Andrew Canyon, dollar sign,
parens, KIM transcript plugin breadcrumb text re.
- Wow, breadcrumb, ooh.
- Which I assume was something from iOS
to tell it where to get some asset to display something.
That doesn't work there.
- I agree with you on the other bits that it's not the same.
And it's very bare bones.
And it is disappointing
'cause I thought they were gonna synchronize everything,
you get it all working the same way.
Because if you could choose to install Signal or WhatsApp
or something like that,
And they're all horrible electron apps,
but they all work the same, right?
So iMessage is platform specific,
and yet is the worst at being a common communications platform.
It's just a really odd thing.
Apple, with all its might, they can't get this basic thing
sorted out.
It works so well on iOS and iPadOS.
It's just such a great experience in the way that it works.
And I can double tap a message to get the little tap back thing and all that.
I don't know. It's a weird one for me.
Every time I use it on the Mac, I kind of just prefer to use it on iOS.
Can we talk ringtones?
Yes, please.
Who added this?
I did.
I thought you might have. I was...
Look, I'll be honest.
I don't know how much listeners have got from what we've said before,
But we add to the topic pool, we add to the show notes, pretty, I suppose, standard podcaster behavior.
But sometimes we don't always, people don't always put the emoji next to the thing to denote who did.
And I was like, who the hell wants to talk about ringtones?
Are they still a thing?
I know. So that was my, that's part of my first question was, A, do you even use a ringtone or know what your ringtone is?
Because my phone's on silent 9000% of the day.
So the other, the thing that brought it to my mind is that I was in an office
environment and people apparently still use ringtones and they use the worst
ringtones ever.
And they're usually the really, really annoying one that's made by their
carrier that is meant to say, Hey, look at me.
I use Verizon.
"Oh, I'm on T-Mobile with my horrific ringtone
"that came on my phone.
"Oh, it's so bad."
And they have it on max volume.
And the worst, the worst thing is not the phone ringtone,
the text ringtone that is like eight seconds long.
- Oh, yes.
- And they're getting message after message after message.
And it's like the ringtone is starting again
before it even ended from the last message.
This is a surprise to me though,
because maybe I'm living under a rock,
but Andrew, do we have carrier
or network specific ringtones in the same way here?
'Cause the last time that I heard something
that was branded was when someone's phone said,
"Hello Moto," and then played that little thing.
- Oh yes, yes. - Right?
- I always think-
- Everyone else I hear, if it's an iPhone,
it's that default one or the same for Android.
- The Marimba one from 2008.
- I don't think we have carrier tones.
Yeah, I always think of, when I hear default,
I think of the Nokia.
I don't think we have carrier ringtones.
No, I didn't even know that was a thing.
But yeah, Marimba drives me crazy.
Jeez.
Yeah.
I mean, in the good old US and A, they will brand/do anything they can to your phone,
unless it's an iPhone, because somehow they're still getting away with that.
I mean, now that's never going to change.
But back when that, you know, when you would go get your Blackberry or your Android phones
back in the early days of this thing, and you would get it and they would have, you
know, if it was Verizon, you'd have 35 Verizon apps on there, and there'd be a wallpaper
and it would have a ringtone and it'd have a startup sound.
And the ringtone, if you notice, I hope you've all turned this off, but iPhone by default
has it plays a second message ping.
So if you receive a message and haven't done anything with it, it'll ping you a second
time and I think...
Message reminder or something?
Yeah, yeah.
I think that's on by default and I reckon most people don't turn it off.
So for every message, you actually get...
You get twice.
You get pinged twice.
And then that same person has probably set the fog horn.
I remember that I liked that function pre-Apple Watch because I would sometimes forget or
the...
In fact, that was the thing that came up with that whole messages discussion and features
I saw recently that there isn't a mark as unread in Apple's iMessage. So that was kind of my unread of,
"Oh, by the way, you haven't done something about this." But with an Apple watch, like to your point,
Jason, there's a ringtone selected, but it's always on silent or the volume's down low or
something because my watch pings me. Do either of you use a ringtone at all?
Or do you have your phone on, on Audible ever? Never.
No, it's always mute. And my watch is mute as well.
Yeah, same. I think people who don't wear an Apple Watch or equivalent smartwatch don't quite get it.
And if they don't want one, fair enough, you know, each to their own. But I just think,
why wouldn't you want to be privately notified about something that will just stay in the
notification centre on your wrist if you don't get to it straight away? Don't tell the world
and yourself and bother yourself constantly about someone wants to talk to you.
Now Andrew we've come to a very important point I don't want to labour over this too much because it is a very big fandom so I'm going to behave.
I'm going to sit back and only really offer things if addressed how about that.
Is this media corner.
I think I think it is a devoted media corner devoted to your very important catch up of a very certain franchise so I'm gonna let you start off and we'll go from there.
Okay, hit the music
Media corner this little movie series called the matrix
Martin is as you all know he's been banging on about this movie for a long time and I knew that I had seen the first one I had some semi vague recollection of the second one.
And then I had nothing for the one after that and the new one Martin I have done you a big solid I've watched all of them over again.
So impressed very impressed in order to write you watched but you went back 123 and then watch the fourth right.
Yep yep so we're right back to the original the original is still excellent still really like it it's.
It is perfect it's perfection I would almost go so far as to say it is a great movie the effects even though the data they still actually kind of hold up.
The premise, I still love it. It makes you think. The acting's good. There's a lot to love about
the original Matrix. I have very few issues with it. Your comment about the effects being dated
but still holding up, I think it's because of what the movie is about that the effects
will always work. I don't know if I'm explaining that really very well, but the way that the world
is and once you find I mean I guess I'm I'm spoiling the matrix I don't maybe
you there may be spoilers careful people what's the timeline on spoilers like how
long does something have to be out anyway for the matrix I mean you you kind
of understand you're in this alternate university kind of world thing but the
way that because the effects are the way they are it's kind of perfectly fine no
matter what they look like because at any point it's like well yeah they're in
the Matrix. That's what it looks like. So I think your point is exactly correct that it's one of the
rare times where the effects, regardless of what they look like, it's totally fine. It just works.
There's also a point in the story where people are constantly saying that something didn't feel
right about the world in which they were in. It's reality, but it's not quite. It's filtered
through or designed by something that thinks differently. Yeah, it wasn't a CG person that
that they were trying to trick you into thinking this is a real person and now you look at
it from today's technology like that looks like crap.
It's not like that.
So it's really cool.
So the matrix excellent.
Okay.
So happy with that one.
So I was quite enthusiastic.
All right.
I liked it.
I'd forgotten how much I quite liked it.
So number two, this should be good.
I remembered this one because I remembered it had the dread the Albino dreadlock guys
in it.
All right.
That was my memory.
Okay.
So it all starts off well enough.
in the back in there but like what do you call that little the ship with that
in the the nebuchadnezzar in the blood vessels of the earth good description
and yeah I'm watching I think this is pretty good and and then we get that
whole I'm gonna jump around here because I don't have the encyclopedic memory of
the movie like Martin does but you suddenly you've got that French guy
He's just been very French and a lot of the nerve engine a lot of the exposition.
Okay, but I home and then you get the and then he's got the bodyguards who are the dreadlock guys like alright this is going to get good now.
And kind of doesn't and then you've got him jumping around again in his fight he had this extended battle scene right of him fighting like a million Mr Smith is that number two is that number three.
Number 2 and and I'm sort of like jumping between do I buy into this.
It is all the Matrix so they're not real people but surely he'll be overwhelmed by that many Smiths get his.
So powerful but it's a computer program course like physics don't apply.
I have an explanation for that.
And then we get to the freeway scene right which is kind of cool but this is where the effects don't work the effects do look dated on this.
Saying you know the flying off the.
The truck and almost falling off and all that kind of stuff and then I can I'm a self jumping in and out of reality because there was one point where they jump off a bridge.
Or something and onto a moving truck and I was like.
And and then they jump from one truck to another and I'm thinking what's their velocity and as soon as they lose traction with the truck going at that speed.
This their velocity changes and they wouldn't be able to land on that truck again because it would be by and it's in this in out sort of my brain between thinking no but it's the matrix it's not real so they can manipulate it so therefore they can do that but what's so I'm confused by the physics engine that were playing with here.
And then overall you have the worst part of this second movie is that the albino dreadlock guys are basically one done villains.
What they underutilized massively so thumbs down on matrix 2.
Matrix 3 this one next one will be quick matrix 3 they should have just called it the battle bots.
Because I had no I had never seen matrix 3 basically it's just an extended.
Make battle with that be the matrix colon battle bots or with that just be.
That the matrix colon battle bots I would have watched it way soon so I've never watched this one this is my first viewing of it I had no idea it's like a video game it's just like.
I'm in a big Mac with giant machine guns.
Shooting it squid I remember that scene as a good scene when he did that and yet despite all the squid flying around.
The destruction being rent upon Zion.
There is still the need for manual reloading and pushing out your bullets in a wheelbarrow.
And somehow there's still a clear path for you to steer this wheelbarrow around to get to the battle boss.
The rate of fire of those battle bots there is no way that there was enough ammunition in those
buckets those reload buckets
okay, and
It's just it was a mess that that third movie was a mess, okay?
So thumbs thumbs up on that one or but I like the battle bots it's kind of fun, so I'm giving you a thumb sideways
Maybe thumbs 45 degrees down. It's a tough one
45 degrees.
Wow.
This rating system is really.
Okay.
And now finally I move into right.
This is the matrix.
The new one, right?
And now I do have to be careful of spoilers here.
Yeah.
That one did come out within the last two months.
So I didn't need to watch it cause I'd watched the first matrix a week prior.
So it was a total waste of my time because it was like star.
It was like star Wars.
And they just, it was the same story told again.
But worse no no it wasn't not at all so there have the end of the lesson.
So this one would be matrix colon star wars is that what you would call that one or or don't call it don't call it matrix.
Resurrection just got the matrix again.
Or we could call it the you suggested this to me Jason you got the Matrix Colin John Wick edition.
Yeah because basically he's just John Wick.
And where was Morpheus what somebody's got to tell me why isn't Morpheus in this.
Totally explained it was explained in the fourth movie.
No but really what was the contract negotiations or like as I know the original Oracle's dead so they had to recast that.
So where's where's Morpheus really.
Okay so wait can I can I just draw a quick line in the sand there okay so that was the comprehensive.
Full series review by Andrew Canyon you can see all of his in depth reviews at.
I'm on letterboxd.
Letterboxd dot something.
/canyon. Summarizing some of the most philosophically dense cinema ever made in two sentences. That was
good. Yeah. Okay. So, okay. The first one I believe was deemed perfection. Is that okay on your end?
I totally agree with that. I would list it as my equal favorite film.
Okay. So, the second one, we had a little bit more talking about it. It sounded like it was
pretty well received. He's seen it twice now. He's not as big as number one, but still okay.
Third one is where we start to get a little bit iffy here. So the third one, I believe he said
something to the effect of didn't need to be made. I think he said that at one point. What
would be your opinion on number three there? I thoroughly enjoy number three, and it's for a
number of reasons but I'll try to keep it brief. What I like about number three is that by the time
that you've gotten to number three and this is what I find so particularly impressive about how
it was made because for anyone who doesn't know number two and number three were made
simultaneously and they have very very different vibes or feels so by the time you get to the third
one sorry spoiler pause or leave now if you want by the time you get to the third one the myth or
the prophecy of the one has been unraveled it was a control system by the machines right so number
Number three is incredibly dark. It's incredibly hopeless in its outlook and it kind of measures Andrew's review.
Yeah, exactly. So you've got martyrdom. You've got much more of a view into the real world and the circumstances of how humanity is living six anomalies or matrix reloads into future history.
So to me, it's a really, really daring conclusion that actually kills off people in the story who people are very emotionally attached to his fans. So I thought it was daring. I thought it was dark. I thought it was impressive that they actually made a film at the same time as the other sequel, which feels totally different and has arguably a bit of a darker look to it as well.
Wow, that is a completely different take than I got just moments ago from-
He didn't even mention the Battle Box.
That's a view into the real world that I mean the fact that for the first one you kind of live in this.
What is the matrix you know you really kind of cut off from the rest of human civilization as it lasts number two expands that universe and number three kind of suffocates you again and brings you into this very.
Man vs machine feel so that's what I mean it feels and looks totally different.
Fourth movie in the franchise.
I would say in the way that and I like The Force Awakens from Star Wars, right?
I feel like The Force Awakens, even though I loved it, was more of a New Hope rebooted than what The Matrix Resurrections was.
What I loved about Resurrections was that it actually and I saw people complain about this online that it doesn't offer anything new or there's nothing thematically different, which I find totally false.
Purely because what was so fascinating about this and this is where I think I'm not having go at you Andrew but where you were saying about suspending your idea of reality.
Right and what it is you know you were saying like you had to remind yourself what was real and what wasn't the whole resurrection thing and this is.
I'll try to stay brief here this is what impresses me about the Matrix is a sci-fi franchise more than any other is that you have things like.
AI and replicas and replicants and Blade Runner and Terminators and stuff all these different things but it's generally us versus them.
The Matrix actually interweaves two totally different human classes that tolerate each other into the one new future version of the real world.
Being the pod born ones who are essentially manufactured by machines and the ones who are born of normal circumstances once they've been released and propagated in the real world.
Now, what you essentially have is a totally different class of human which can interface
with computer technology.
You're essentially talking about some version of the superhuman which can manipulate a virtual
environment or in Neo's case is the anomaly actually interface with machines in the real
world, right, as you see in the Matrix Revolutions.
In the Matrix Resurrections, what you essentially see is the discussion post-Jesus style martyrdom
and revolutions that Neo does fighting Smith.
and Trinity actually being brought back to life. They are rebooted in a sense and the philosophical
implications of what that means that a human can be brought back and that they are essentially a
manufactured product is tremendously interesting to me. And the fact that you can essentially
conduct repairs on them and we just kind of, I think that just kind of people ignore that,
that the entire premise of this movie as a reboot actually physically reboots the characters.
That's fascinating to me. That sounds very different from what I heard Andrew talk about,
I'm just going to say. That was a very different approach and take on the film. So, thank you for
that. It's more thought through, I'll give him that. Yeah, I think there may have been a- like,
an edge of extra thought to it. Not to say that you didn't really think about it, but I think
I got to give the nod to Martin on that one, I think. That's fair.
- Yeah, that's okay. - Sorry.
(upbeat music)
- Mixing food slash separating food,
I just need to know from both of you
what your stance is on that.
So you get a plate of food
whenever it could be like a holiday thing.
You've got different, you know,
you got maybe a vegetable
and maybe some potato thing going on, a meat.
You got different food categories all on a plate, right?
and they're usually in separate areas of the plate.
Are you a eat each thing on its own,
doesn't have to be all before you can go to the next one,
but it can be, that's a valid option,
or are you the tornado mix it all together
and just eat it all together?
What's your take on that?
And I have a feeling I know what each of your answers are.
I don't mix the food like the tornado style, but I don't eat all my peas and then eat all my meat and then eat all my potatoes.
I might have a little bit one at a time of each or I'll have a bit of each on a fork at the same time.
Okay, you might throw a couple peas in the corn.
Maybe, maybe. Correct. Taste sensations as you go along.
But I and I don't have any fear of food touching or anything like that.
So there's no issues with any of that kind of stuff.
But they do remain in their individual areas on the plate.
I would agree with what Andrew said about making little flavor sensations.
You want to combine some little side dishes or vegetables.
I'm assuming that was a kind of steak and three veg view, wasn't it, Andrew?
The idea that you have, you know, a few vegetables to the side
and you might combine it with the meat or something.
Yeah, yeah. I mean, if you're having a stir-fry or something,
it's kind of some of the work's already been done for you.
Yeah, yeah. This is things arrive to you separated. What do you do?
Right. Yeah. I would say, let's say that it's a meal where there are multiple components.
Typically, what I like to do is, let's say that there is a meat part of the
dish that has its own sauce or something. I would like to try that by itself first,
or anything that has its own inherent flavor as a part of the meal so I can go, "Oh, that's what that tastes like. I like that."
Exactly. And then from there, I can mix and match and do things because I've at least understood what's been delivered to me first.
Okay? Just want to see what the starting point is. Where I don't mix things is, let's say that you've ordered Thai or Vietnamese food,
and you've got a range of different curries or stir fries or noodle dishes or something.
I'm not a huge fan of the tornado thing there because I think if I've ordered a musselman curry, right?
And I have maybe a green curry, there is already a wonderful mix of flavors to make said curries separately.
So then to mix the musselman and the green, while that may be delicious, I've actually compromised the ideal flavor of that thing that's already been mixed by someone who knows what they're doing in a kitchen.
That's a flavor integrity compromise for sure.
Exactly, which I used to laugh about because when my grandparents were still alive, this is my
mum's parents, they loved spicy food and they would actually do exactly what I said that I
don't do. They would go, "Why wouldn't you mix all the curries together? This is fantastic." So,
I respected their taste buds, but I thought, "Don't you want to kind of look, there's the
coconut in that, not just mixed together." And I admire them for their bravery when they were still
with us, but that's not my style. What I will plug just quickly though, Natasha is known for doing
something which I don't do this is where I kind of I would not mix this she will mix pasta and salad.
Now you can have a pasta salad but I'm talking about the pasta dish now to me it might end up tasting good well it can taste good I'm not saying it's bad I am.
Just a point of clarification a pasta you're talking like a cold pasta dish.
I'm talking about like a warm like it's a pasta meal unless I misunderstood she will happily insert salad elements on and combine it on the fork.
Like you having a spaghetti bolognese.
And you're gonna throw throw a little lettuce in there.
I must have totally misunderstood then yes that's what she's saying.
Where is to me the salad is the refreshment at the end or intermittently like glasses of water something else that I don't mix and this actually happened today at family brunch if there are roasted breakfast tomatoes.
I don't really mix that with anything because to me that is the king of the breakfast and it comes as the juicy refreshment post cheese or bacon or eggs or bread or whatever it is.
It can be on the bread it can be mixed up maybe if that's how it's presented but if I'm given roasted tomatoes like on a vine as they were this morning that is ultimate breakfast refreshment.
Will throw my the pasta thing still cuz I thought I had that figured out and now I'm more confused than when we started.
So what do you do with your food Jason.
I have changed over time.
As I've aged,
the mixing has become more okay.
Whereas previously as a child,
I would prefer those plates that had the little compartments
where everything lives in its own little section
and they stayed in their section.
Jason Bento Burke.
That's what we're saying.
Yep.
And you would,
that's that was exactly what they called me until I was at least
13 years old
Yeah, so everything would be separate all the time and
Now I'll do a little more dabbling in the mixing to get a little bit of cross pollination amongst the different food
But I am of the mind that if it came as a prepared thing
Probably just need to eat that thing as it was intended
Somebody went to a lot of thought hopefully of putting that together and there was reason behind it
so you should probably take that and run with it. So there you go.
You want to count us down, Jason?
In three...
Oh, wait, where's my record thing?
In three, two, one, stop.
Why did it not stop?
