Jason you may hate me with the suggestion that's gonna follow because
you are our resident show notes master but I'm thinking we extend the desk
photo extravaganza to the masses the masses of audience that we have
accumulated so what do you two reckon we get people listening you dear listener
to submit your desk photo to us online and maybe we critique it in an upcoming
episode what do you two reckon? I love that idea I would love to see other
people's messes / artistic expressions through desk artistry. Yes I would too.
They've had the chance to sort of laugh and critique our own setups. It's not
fair if it's one way only. So yeah drop us a line and let us see your
battle station. Type it in word format, make a haiku, whatever is your jam. We
want to see it. We don't accept PowerPoint decks. No, no PowerPoint decks.
All right, so you've heard it at home, dear listener, you can send a haiku. I'm
not sure if you'll understand it, but it'll be terribly poetic. If you want to
show us your desk photo, we may critique in an upcoming episode. At the very least
we'll include in the show notes, so pop on Twitter, pop on micro.blog, maybe use
the hashtag #hemisphericviews, that's a new thing for us, or even join the
public discord and send us your photo and we'll include it. Naturally don't
include anything terribly private or secret. A little bit secret is okay though.
I'm just I'm just super excited because Jason has a new gadget and I think we
might be due for some follow-up. I don't I don't know if you guys have heard but
there was an Apple event I think it was seven Apple events ago now if I'm
counting correctly, they decided to do something a little different. Emphasis on
little. The iPhone mini. Okay. The best phone ever made by the fruit company. It
is perfect in every single way. I can show you, no one else can see it, but it
is the smallest phone with all of the same features built in. It fits in your
hand unlike any phone of the last seven years it's a delight. I don't feel like it's any smaller
in terms of the screen. So when I'm looking at it I feel like the same amount of stuff
is on the screen as my previous 11 pro. It's just smaller. That's it. There's not really much more
to say than just it's a great phone in a smaller package. The only thing that I would say that is
maybe weird is immediately when you pick it up your brain switches to this is an
iPhone 5. I don't care what you think in your brain it thinks it's an iPhone 5
which is good in the sense that from a size standpoint the only negative is
that my finger keeps trying to reach around to the top for the power button
okay instinct it's just like it thinks that's where the power button goes it
It obviously is not there, so you immediately are very confused.
But other than that, the phone is absolutely wonderful.
If you thought you wanted a smaller phone, this is the phone to get.
Is that feeling encouraged by the fact that it has the flat sides?
Do you think?
I think so.
Yeah, I think it's the combination of the flat sides and the size that as soon as you
hold it, it just feels like, because you really couldn't reach around to the top with any
of these giganto phones, right?
Like there was just no way to do it.
now you're like, wow, I can actually reach all sides of the phone with my hand.
Maybe there's a button up there.
No, there's not.
That's like the only thing that's been, I guess, surprising.
It's just really, really good.
5G.
I guess that's good too.
I don't know.
I saw it in the, in the, in the bar on top.
And you're happy with the green choice, the green color option?
Oh, the green is gorgeous.
It is.
I could not be happier with this color.
It's the one true color.
I got the green and my wife got the blue.
The blue is also very, very good looking.
- I was an old iPhone 5 user and I really loved it too.
Even though I have big hands and stuff,
it was always just really comfortable to hold.
The one thing that would worry me
about going back to that size
is the legibility of the fonts.
Like looking at the screen, is everything so tiny
that it actually feels like you're either cramped
or just hard to read 'cause everything's small?
- It is definitely smaller.
And I think that's what I would emphasize in terms of the screen is that I think it's,
I mean, I didn't like do any scientific measurements or anything, obviously, but having used an
iPhone 11 pro for a year and now switching to this, I don't in my day to day use of whatever
apps I use, I don't feel like I'm seeing any less.
So I think in terms of what's on the screen is the same, but to your point, I think it
is smaller.
So if legibility, like if you used an 11 pro and you had it on the big text mode, then
I think probably not the phone for you because if you go big text mode on this, it's going
to be strange.
I don't think you're going to like it.
I know like my, I know my, uh, we got my mom an S E two and like she has the text thing
like jacked way up.
Right.
So there's just like very little on the screen.
It just kind of makes the UI weird.
But I think if that's what you're doing, I would say go bigger phone probably.
But if you're fine with just normal text size, then you're going to be fine.
And the keyboard in terms of getting your thumbs around that keyboard?
It's a little bit smaller, but honestly, I think I type equally terrible on any of them.
I don't really see that as being a problem.
If anything, maybe it makes me be a little more diligent about typing slower instead
of trying to speed type, but I don't think it's really any different.
I type equally bad on both.
How are you coping without the third telephoto lens?
I don't care.
I mean, I, ironically, ironically, the other day we were out walking around and I was taking
some photos and I actually was like, Oh, this would be a really good use of the wide angle.
It was like, I haven't said that once in the last year.
And all of a sudden I said that total coincidence, but there will be a time where I missed the
telephoto.
I'm sure, I'm sure you'll get over it.
The size of the phone is so much more important.
I actually don't realize I have the phone in my pocket,
which is insane.
I will go to leave the house and be like,
wait, do I have my phone?
Oh yeah, I know I have my phone.
It's in my pocket.
It's so light.
That's the other thing,
the aluminum compared to the stainless steel,
it just weighs nothing.
This phone is so, so light.
- You're killing me here, Jason.
Please, I've spent enough.
- Yeah, I think everyone should buy one.
Absolutely.
Please, just go, go out.
Don't go out.
No, actually do not go out.
Do not leave your house.
Order it online, have it delivered.
done.
Yeah, we had the one more thing of it where we got, what do we get?
Max, we got new max.
It's like fondly.
It's not always something people are excited about, but when it contains a
completely new architecture in terms of chips inside, pretty damn exciting if I
do say so myself.
So we got new Mac minis.
We got new MacBook Air and a new kind of entry level MacBook Pro 13 inch.
They all have what is now known as the M1 Apple Silicon.
And I'm loving your American pronunciation of that, by the way, too.
The con.
I was actually, I was, I was wanting both of you to say how you say Apple Silicon,
but we can get to that because I hear a lot of silicone out there and
it just makes me cringe. That's definitely not correct.
It depends where the application is really, whether it's silicon or silicone.
Yeah, well, it's definitely not inside your Mac. There may be some silicone in there somewhere,
but it's certainly not in the M1. So the M1, I mean, I'm not going to go into a deep dive
on what that is. I'm sure if you don't know what it is, you don't care, which is fine.
know that it is amazing and blows away everything that's currently out there.
Uh, if you bought a MacBook air entry-level MacBook pro or Mac mini.
Prior to this event.
I hope it was a long time prior because these are quite a big upgrade.
Sure.
There are some caveats, but I didn't personally get one.
I really want one, but it's one of those where like, I don't, I hate saying this.
I don't need it, but I'm told someone in my close proximity did make a purchase.
Who might that be?
That would be me.
I dove into the Mac mini thing and just like the watch event, I was going into this thinking
I need a new Mac.
I went into detail about this during our HV mini episode.
If you haven't heard that, dear listener, go back and revisit them because it's good
fun.
knew that I needed to update this thing because as much as I love this machine, the temptation
of Apple Silicon, system on a chip, all contained, I got the 16GB RAM version with the 2TB SSD,
so that's doubling storage for me, doubling RAM for me, I can swap out this box, put the
new one in, it's on its way so I'm very keen to receive that. And of course I'll update
you once it's actually here. But funnily enough, sticking with the silver case which I thought
was very interesting, not the space grey, when I actually swap this around it's going
to look like nothing changed on my desk so it's going to be bizarre to have what essentially
looks like the exact same machine but potentially blazing fast with iOS apps on my screen.
That's going to be very strange.
I can't wait to see or hear rather what that is like.
In my head it just sounds amazing.
There was all that brouhaha and carry on when the home app first came.
You remember that whole thing about the date pickers and the slidey things and this is
the end of the Mac as we know it and everyone just said calm down.
It's not a big deal.
So look, I mean there are some iOS apps that I'd be keen to see on the Mac.
It'd be interesting to see how those mechanics translate to an indirect input model.
Andrew were you tempted by anything?
I am very very tempted by both of the MacBooks that have been released.
Which sort of I want to put my hand up and I might need a little mini counseling session
here because I am so conflicted about which is the one to get.
Really you're just saying do I want a touch bar and a better microphone and a slightly
brighter screen and that's it. There's really nothing else to differentiate
other than the size shape. But yeah, a fan I guess is the thing and whether it
makes that much of a difference in performance. I've never had a MacBook Air
though. My wife has, she had one of the earlier ones. I've always been a MacBook
Pro user, but similarly I've never had a touch bar because I went a long time not
getting a MacBook Pro because of the butterfly keyboards. I'm in this weird
world where I don't have a antipathy towards the touch bar or I don't love it
because I've never used it and that seems to be the defining feature. So what
do you do? Do you go save a little bit of money in a MacBook Air or do you say
well just get the Pro? I'm open to feedback and opinions. I think the Air
would be a good option purely because for work I have the last of the MacBook
that came with the butterfly switch.
Now that, you know, that keyboard has its own issues,
but I've been very impressed with the performance
of that computer on an older Intel chip.
So I can only imagine that you could probably get away
with the MacBook Air and be very, very happy.
Jason, do you agree or disagree?
- I agree and disagree all at the same time.
Here's where I would come at it from my own personal angle.
I think it's gonna be a matter
of how long are you gonna keep it.
And I think we know that as well, I think everyone knows at this point, Andrew has a
lot of spreadsheets revolving around costs of things and depreciation and so forth.
He's not going to get an M1 and then jump up and get an M2 in six months.
I think we know that's not going to happen.
Not going to happen.
No.
So with the MacBook Air, I think it is absolutely amazing.
And I think that's a great computer.
I think my only concern would be long term, not have, and I don't, it's just, it's hard
to tell.
We don't have them, but I have to imagine that fan is going to mean when you fire up
that, you know, that one app that uses a lot of juice, that you're going to end up back
on those, those efficiency cores sooner than you would with a fan.
Start ripping the DVDs.
What's going to happen?
Right, exactly.
- Exactly, 'cause you know, all those DVDs
that you're ripping with your back of the hair.
But it's not your main machine either.
So if it were your main machine,
that would make me say, okay, GoPro,
but it's not your main machine.
And you have an iPad, so you can do iPad-y things also.
So I would probably go Air
just because it's smaller slightly
and you can kinda get away with carrying it around more.
Also, where are we going?
We're not going anywhere right now.
When are we gonna go somewhere?
If you're flying all over the place,
definitely the air it's a really tough position to be in with these chips being like actually the same
it's not just that they you know spec wise they're the same chip they're both the m1 if you get the
slightly better uh macbook air you get exactly the same m1 you know the lower end macbook air has one
less core but i'm not gonna do that to myself i'm getting the eight core right so at that point
you're the exact same chip, exact same performance, same everything. If it were a hundred dollars
difference, I would say just get the Pro because why not? You know, then you get a touch bar.
I think the touch bar is awesome. Apple have not made this easy. Thanks, Apple. You're a
little quadrant of, you know, home, business, laptop, desktop. You've buggered up your quadrants.
I'm confused. The thing with the iOS apps that I, it was something I was thinking about yesterday,
actually. I was really excited. Oh, I could have iOS apps on my Mac. I'm curious. Let's
see, pick an app that has both. Fantastical. I am looking at that right now. There's a
Mac version, which is great. There's an iOS version, which is also great. Can you just,
can you have them both? Can you, do you have to pick? I wonder how that works. If there
is a Mac app, can you not have the iOS app? I don't, I'm not expecting an answer obviously,
But I'm just curious, I've only ever thought of it as apps that don't exist on the Mac,
you can now have the iOS version.
What if one already exists, but maybe you prefer the iOS one to the Mac one?
I wonder, or you bought the iOS one, but not the Mac one.
That's another issue.
I'm wondering how people are going to get around that.
I see it as if it's the modern form of shovelware.
So we haven't gotten around to developing a Mac app ever, and we probably never will.
So here, here's our iOS app, have fun with it.
Whereas Fantastical for instance would be, you know, that's crafted with love and care
as a native Mac experience.
So I would think from a developer's point of view, they will not make that available
for the Mac.
Partly because they want you to experience the full love and care, and also they don't
want to do themselves out of revenue.
And I sort of think the same probably be true of the Omni group for instance, that's like,
I think of OmniFocus which I use everywhere all the time.
You could theoretically run that on your, the iOS app on your Mac and it would be okay.
But I still don't think you'd really want to if you had the choice.
I've had the same sort of experience with things like IARiter.
I use it on my iPad heavily, I use it on my Mac heavily, and I would actually be pretty
happy to run the iPadOS version on the Mac.
There are just those little niggly things like when you want to rename a file or drag
things, the behavior is slightly different.
So I think maybe it depends on the level of care from the developer as to how many of
those nitpicky details or paradigm elements they adopt.
So it'll be very interesting to see how it goes.
So that leads us perhaps into that next area of how do we test these apps?
Yeah, test flight.
I'm guessing you could do test flight on the Mac.
I don't know how that's going to work, but it seems like, well, again, I guess if they
don't uncheck the box, then TestFlight will be available on the Mac.
So we'll have to see if that person does or does not do their job correctly in terms of
checking the box.
But I think TestFlight is interesting because we've always had demos on the Mac.
There's the option to do a demo outside of the Mac App Store on the Mac since the Mac
existed.
You could give it away, you could do a shareware thing, you could do a 30-day trial, whatever
it is.
Obviously, we've never had that on iOS.
There's not ever been, probably never will be, never say never, but there hasn't been
yet a way to really do a good testing of an app.
I think in-app purchase is probably the closest we've ever gotten.
But lately, I'm kind of feeling like TestFlight is the way to demo apps and with things like
AirPort.
I don't know if either of you have used that.
It's an app that comes from TestFlight that basically tells you about all the apps that
you can get in TestFlight.
Wow.
Meta.
I'm honestly surprised it hasn't been shut down, but at the same time, I kind of wonder
if this is just, let's not talk about it, but if people want to figure out a way to
do trials on their own through TestFlight, go ahead, because I think they're limited
on how many people they can have on a TestFlight.
So it kind of naturally makes it not a good replacement for an app store because you can't
charge, you can't get any money.
I don't think in-app purchases even work within TestFlight.
So it's not like they're getting around the app store at all.
But I just, I don't know.
Do you guys use TestFlight?
I have way too many apps in TestFlight at this point.
It's kind of gross.
It just kind of occurred to me that maybe this is how we do demos on iOS,
and maybe that will transition to the Mac also.
I've used TestFlight, obviously nowhere near as much as you have, Jason. I've used it predominantly
for when NetNewsWire came out on iOS, and then I think there was also the great third-party app
Gluon for micro.blog by Vincent Ritter. Really enjoyed that. But there's something about TestFlight
I think it's pretty easy to use. It seems pretty self-explanatory that you're downloading a
a test version and installing it, but thinking about how that would translate as an experience
to people who are more novice users or maybe just want to try something out, I think there's
just a little bit of friction there.
I don't think it's terribly self-explanatory or easy for people to understand that it's
like a testing environment within another app.
I think if Apple were to rethink the whole approach and put it into the App Store and
have a little demo list area, pretty much the same idea but within the App Store it
be more approachable but it doesn't strike me as something that is terribly friendly
for the average user. Does that sound elitist? I don't know. I don't think so. No, I think it
sounds reasonable and that's why it is quarantined away, you know, so you have to do some digging to
get it. I think it's by design in a sense. Yeah, I use it from time to time. I go off and on with
it. Sometimes I just like the purity of running the... because usually I've got the app, you know,
I'm not really using it as a... maybe I'm demoing the new features, but I'm usually not demoing
an entirely new app that I have otherwise no interest in. But overall I generally just prefer
running the production version. I also feel guilty because I don't particularly, or don't often,
send back feedback. I don't really give much feedback. So I feel like I'm wasting everybody's
time a little bit and it's not appropriate. Especially if there are seat limits. You know,
It would be a shame for somebody who's really into beta testing...
...to miss out on a seat because I've got it and I'm just playing with it and using it.
I don't know if that really is a problem.
I'm not a developer so I don't see that side of things.
You get that annoying orange dot though on your icons.
I don't like the dot, no.
But that's pretty much all that you really notice that's different or annoying about it.
Because I had this experience where I can't remember the name of the app...
...but I was on test flight for a particular RSS app that was being tested.
and it was super polished, it was beautiful and I think it was just as they had redesigned a lot of
the elements of iOS to have the large banners, the bold headings at the top. It was the new design
language at the time and it was really beautiful, really polished and I started to really like using
this but there was this ominous message about how when it would be finalized there would be this fee
and there'd be a subscription and then you'd have this recurring payment for these features
And in my mind, using the test flight, it felt like a completed app.
And I had it completely free.
And there was this sort of dissonance.
There was this feeling of, oh, I've got this thing already,
but I'm going to have to pay for this.
And I didn't really want to stick around, even though I really enjoyed it.
Because I pay for enough services already.
So there might even be the risk if it's too polished
and you're used to having this thing just auto updating,
but you don't become a converted customer
when suddenly you have to pay for this thing.
Yeah, it's such a fine line, isn't it? With like, is it a genuine subscription or is it,
gee, it would be horrible for this app to go away, you know, like,
when is it protection money, basically? Nice app you have here, be ashamed if it disappeared.
Real quick, does Australia have Apple Pay Cash yet? Just doing my Fortnite Lee check.
No. No, that's a no. Okay, just checking. I'm gonna keep checking back. It's gonna happen someday. We're gonna give it to you
But look spreadsheets have been mentioned already and and they've brought up money and I can see something in the in the show notes here
That something about a weird document that Andrew keeps is that related to spreadsheets or money?
Cash related anything like that. You are the CFO after all which weird document. That's the question
I mean, I feel like most of his documents are probably pretty weird
They all are pretty weird. I gotta admit
I think it was off-air that we were talking about this bizarro kind of documents and I mentioned the fact that I had this spreadsheet
referred to earlier in the podcast I
Buy a lot. I in least in in my world. It's a lot of computer hardware
It probably isn't really but for a hobbyist standard, but I still like to track things. I I want to know
How much money am I spending on this stuff and how long does it last?
Whenever there's a significant asset purchase, I will put it down and I'll notate the acquisition date
I have a column for the disposal date and then I have a life of service calculation
So it works out whether it's disposed yet or whether it's just today and will tell me how long it's been in service for
I've got a purchase price and then a cost per week so I can start to understand how much is this
Asset costing me on a weekly basis if I was to look at it like that
So I you know for instance I can tell you that my original Apple watch
Series one I bought on the 28th of September in 2016 and I disposed of it on the 1st of October 2020
So it lasted me
209 weeks and a day at
$449 that works out to $2.15 per week that compares with my current Apple watch
which is currently costing me $98 per week.
- Whoa.
- I need to hang on to that for a bit longer.
It's only been in service for six weeks and four days.
- That's a lot of blood oxygen measurements right there.
$98 a week.
(laughing)
- Now the great thing, you get some good data
and you get some bad data.
My, where is it?
I have a cinema display, which is still battling on.
Cinema display, bought it in 2011.
On the 15th of January in 2011.
- That thing must be paying you every week now.
My goodness 513 weeks of service. That's like 10 years. Where's it sitting? Where is it operating?
My wife is currently using that as her external monitor for the her 2013 MacBook Pro
That's dedication. I know this is why I don't want to upgrade computers because that monitor won't work anymore
It's not even retina, but it's costing me. It's cost me $2.53 a week still with the original purchase purchase price was
$1,300. Yeah. Yeah, it starts to see you basically gotta say I don't like I don't like this spreadsheet
at all. This is this doesn't seem like any kind of news I would ever want to be able to have readily
accessible. No, that's fine. I've got a chart. Of course, this is charted as well. Now, I want to
know, because naturally, as the CFO, you're tracking things, it's sensible, it's responsible,
you want to know where your money's going, what sort of value getting out of your investments,
I get this whole thing, like Jason, it's crushing my spirit a little bit. But I want to know,
When push comes to shove and a purchase decision comes around and that highly irrational human
behavior kicks in of "ooh, shiny, me want", does this actually help you to stop or to rationalize
or does it just sort of fall to the wayside and you end up putting a new number in it because
you bought something? It's a great question Martin. I see this spreadsheet as more of a
backward-looking document, historical information. However, that doesn't let me
off the hook because what I have to manage that is I have my YNAB budget.
You need a budget.com. Not a sponsor. Not a sponsor. They should be because the
thing is amazing and you know if you want to sign up use my referral code at
least you know hook me up that way. But you need a budget. I have a complete
chunk of items that almost sort of replicates my spreadsheet and it sets
aside a certain amount of money each week. So I kind of know I will want a new
Apple Watch in 2023. Right, so I look and I say my first one lasted me
four years, so I assume this one will last me about that. So I'll say and the I
reckon it'll cost about 500 bucks in 2023. So it tells me that I need to
there for budget X number of dollars to get to that amount in 2023.
And so I do the same thing with all my hardware purchases.
I build up money so that when the time comes, it's sitting there, I go guilt
free, I can buy myself a new computer because the money sitting there waiting
for it, waiting for me to use it on that purpose.
With like this new MacBook Air, would you put that in there and find out it's, I
I don't know, $400 a week or whatever.
And with that, is there some kind of trigger
that says if it's less than X dollars per week,
it's a go versus no go?
Or is it truly just stuff that goes in there
and I'll look at it later?
- No, the dollars per week thing
is just a little informational thing 'cause I could.
- Got it.
- But I do need to have the money put aside
before I can purchase it.
And look, if I don't have enough saved up
and I really want to get it, I might say,
well, look, I'm going to defer my purchase of the watch.
And I'm going to put the money I'd set aside for the watch
into the MacBook Pro/Air category.
And I'm going to go now.
- Or you just record a podcast and we tell you
it's a great idea, go ahead and buy it.
And then you think, sounds good.
Board meetings are for making tough decisions.
And that is what this is.
- Andrew, I have another question.
Natasha calls me a pusher.
And when she says that, she's not referring to drugs.
She's referring to the fact that I constantly try to push
apps and services and different things onto her.
Translating this to you,
do you push such spreadsheet behavior
onto your wife, Hannah?
- Yes, I do.
We pool our money.
So we've been married and together long enough
that we just, all our revenue goes into the one bucket
and we manage it jointly.
But I'm always reminding her,
Don't forget to enter those groceries into YNAB.
Oh, you know, I was, I was reconciling YNAB and I noticed there was a, uh, you know, some shoes got bought and they weren't in the register.
I don't mind you buying the shoes.
I don't care about that, but maybe if you could just enter it into YNAB.
On your phone.
You must be so popular at home.
Oh mate, this is, it's not easy being a CFO.
Okay.
So if I told you, if I told you that I went grocery shopping with Natasha on the weekend and I went and bought mangoes, even though they were more
Expensive than usual and I got more than the last time and I didn't enter it into a spreadsheet and I then enjoyed said mangos
How are you feeling? Jason's looking worried. Are you okay about that Andrew?
He would divorce you in a minute
Look, I don't like the idea you didn't enter the transaction anywhere
I'm glad you enjoyed the mangoes, but you need to realize that you're stealing from your future self
because maybe you went over budget for those groceries and so that means that buying your your
Mac mini just got a little bit harder
So I hope you enjoyed that mango. I really did often I buy the Kensington pride
They're really good. But these were our to eat you mangoes
They sound delightfully close to our to D to nothing to do with Star Wars
Also, Disney is not a sponsor, but they were mega mangoes. They were more expensive
the flesh was beautiful and supple and I
Regret nothing as past present or future Martin, but I will take on board your budgeting tips
I fully stand behind your mango buying decision. Thank you. And I think you should have bought twice as many as you did
On your spreadsheet you keep talking about per week and it's making me a little bit hesitant to ask this because this is somewhat of a
It's a touchy topic. When does your week starts and maybe this is like Australia verse
US although I am in not the majority in terms of US people
Does your week start on a Monday or on a Sunday?
regardless of which it is, why is that and
Yeah, what do you what's your personal preference? And do you find that your personal preference conflicts with the people slash things around you?
Yeah
I have very strong feelings about this in Australia as far as I'm aware
someone had the bright idea that the first day of the week is Sunday. I don't understand where this
came from. I'm not a particularly religious person but as far as I'm aware Sunday is the rest day
traditionally. It's the seventh day of the week. It's even in that thing next to Saturday that is
collectively known as the weekend. Monday is the first day of the week as far as I'm concerned.
I change the calendar to reflect that if the default setting in any app says that it's Sunday.
And you know what? Somehow, unlike, you know, not acknowledging daylight saving time or something,
when you choose to make Monday the first day of your week, the world doesn't collapse. You're
not suddenly in sync and going to work on a Sunday. Everything goes as it should. So I'm
in the Monday first day of the week camp. Thank you, Andrew. You are now in the hot seat.
You're right, Martin, that in Australia, the official way, I believe, is that Sunday
The beginning being a rule follower myself for them
many many years of my life I
Recognized the
well, that's that's the law of the land that we live in so therefore Sunday is day one and
And I rationalized it in the weekend. It's it's week and it's ending the week
So you have end over here end over here. It's on the ends
Weekend, it's not week end of the week weekend. It's ends of the week weekend
now
That was my position until I would say 18 months ago. Maybe two years ago
Now something thought I'm gonna change it
because really whenever I think about my life, I think about Saturday and Sunday as a block unit and
Monday through Friday is another block unit. So why am I
Complicating myself and when I want to plan I need to see Saturday and Sunday next to each other not
You know one half of it on one screen
Swipe across to see the next screen. I have now changed my life is
infinitely better
People if you haven't changed two weeks begin on a Monday and they end on a Saturday Sunday
You are doing it wrong. I am so relieved. I'm so glad we don't have to cancel this podcast
I was I was on edge there for the last 45 seconds. I was it was going in a bad way
I was I had my finger hovering on the delete button of the website
But I'm I am happy to see that this has come back around
Obviously, I'm the same way.
Monday starts the week.
It just visually, it looks better on a calendar.
And I've gotten rid of calendar apps that couldn't do it.
I'm very happy to hear that you're
both in the correct side of the calendar camp.
I'm glad you asked.
I'm glad you asked me now and not two years ago.
It would have been the end of a beautiful friendship.
Yeah, if you had been doing Sundays
the first day of the week, how on earth did we even
schedule this podcast?
How many time zones are between us?
And then suddenly the date.
- Ah, it was stressful.
- Nightmare.
- Did I mention in my spreadsheet
that I can tell you both the median
and the average price of all assets ever purchased?
- No, you didn't, but please, please go on.
I think everyone would like to hear about that.
Can you tell us the formula?
- Absolutely, I can.
Of course I can, it's easy.
- This is numbers, right?
This isn't Excel.
I mean, I know you're all about finance and everything,
but this is not Excel, correct?
- This is numbers.
- Okay.
- I went numbers, it's a personal project,
Therefore numbers can be the go.
Now the median price of all the assets on my column, $499.
So that's the middle price.
- That makes the new laptop only $499.
- Well, not quite.
- How did you manage to get your median price
to sound like an Apple price?
- I know, it's quite impressive, isn't it?
- 'Cause they're all Apple products on the list.
(laughing)
The average is a very unhelpful $729.18.
Doesn't quite have the same ring to it.
(upbeat music)
- Okay, media corner.
It's media corner time.
I hope you came prepared.
And I would like to, let's see who started last time.
I think Martin went first.
So we'll go Andrew first.
- Alrighty.
This is the one I have been enjoying.
I'm still in the process of enjoying this show.
It's a show, again, another Apple TV program.
Continuing on the strong run after I panned it originally
and said Apple TV's not worth it,
suddenly I'm realizing it's totally worth it.
This one is "Long Way Up",
the motorcycle adventure travel show
featuring Ewan McGregor and Charlie Borman,
I think that's his name.
I was a big fan of "Long Way Round" and "Long Way Down"
when they came out,
And it's hard for me to even realize how long ago that actually was.
I think I had to source those from the back of a truck with the license plate
that said Torrance a long time ago.
With a Z.
Yes, definitely with the Z.
Because TV was hard to come by.
That's how long ago that show was, um, was originally aired.
So it's really cool to see this one in, you know, 4K high definition, drones
flying everywhere for the footage and everything.
But what makes this show is other characters.
And I really, yeah, obviously Ewan McGregor
is the driving force.
He's like the known guy, but I actually really like Charlie.
I think he's a good character.
I really enjoy what he brings to the table.
But it's also just really, it's a nice, heartwarming show.
Have a few dramas along the way, things go wrong.
So you have some action, you know,
are they gonna escape?
This is, you know, they're gonna, they're riding on electric motorbikes, which is crazy.
It's just really fun show to watch.
And the scenery is beautiful.
And it just, it's like a epic travelogue.
And that's kind of like the, the thing I'm sure we would all like to do with our own
lives, but we don't have a budget to achieve it.
So long way up.
I don't know anything about this show.
I've heard, I think I'm wondering if this is going to be another Ted Lasso
situation because I hear about it a lot but I never it didn't really pique my
interest when I first saw it well this one has a legacy about it yeah right
yeah so it sounds like there's there's previous shows was it I was under the
impression it was actually these two people as themselves but I meant do I
have that wrong is this actually a show where they're playing characters or are
they just this is about those people this is yeah those people they are
being them they are being themselves I just see them as characters because you
people, people are characters and yes it does have a legacy so this is their
third adventure all with the same the same people even the same sort of camera
crews have joined on so yeah it's a real it you know and you almost sense that
that they're excited to be back together having another adventure after the last
one was a decade ago or however long it was it's really cool and it's just a
great show but also showing like how things are changing and you see them
riding electric, they're riding electric motorbikes and driving electric cars
from the bottom of South America up to Los Angeles. And it's, I mean, no
easy task. And sure they had to support crew and they have pre-prep and all
those sorts of things, but at the end of the day they are still riding these
motorbikes. And it's a really, really cool adventure.
Awesome. Another plus one for the Apple TV column. I think last week I did a game
and I'm gonna do another game surprise this week I'm going to go with a game
called Carto. C-A-R-T-O. It's a very relaxing game. Well I say relaxing I did
get a little heated with it last night but it's a game where you are the
premise is that you have the ability to effectively change the map and the world
around you. So you are walking around like you would in any other kind of game,
but you can go into a kind of overhead view where the map is in squares and you
can rotate each piece and move them around like a jigsaw puzzle to rearrange
and complete different puzzles. Or if you need to get somewhere that you're not
able to get to, you just change the map and now you can get there. So it's a
unique way of manipulating the world around you where you kind of control
what the world looks like versus the other way around where you have to
figure out how to navigate the world. You just you make your own path. It's kind
of a hand-drawn feel to it which is nice instead of the normal you know super
realistic 3d graphics. It's nothing like that. It's a much more tame and just
relaxing puzzle type game. I think if you're not really a hardcore gamer this
still is very appealing I think to anyone who would try it. If you're
end of figuring out puzzles, I think this would be a good game to get into.
And it's also fun just kind of doing it.
It's not actually multiplayer, but if you're with someone else, kind of going
back and forth to try to figure out and just have one person do the controls and
figure out all the puzzles and how to move things around, um, that's kind of how
we've been playing it over the last.
Week or so.
So yeah, Carto is a, it's a, it's a good game.
I think it's all over.
It's on all kinds of platforms.
So, and it's again, not super, you know, it's not a big, big budget, $60 thing.
It's a very reasonably priced.
And I think overall a really well done game.
I'm tempted.
I may end up purchasing that one.
That sounds like something I could get into.
And that was instantly appealing to you, Jason, you, you didn't
have to work through it or.
No, no, it was, I think it was the art style that really stuck out at first.
And then when they did a quick pop out, move the map all around, and now
you're in a wholly different place.
It was a unique mechanic that I've never seen before in a game and it just seemed like that's
the draw, that mechanic seemed very enticing.
Shifting to mine in Media Corner, I thought I'd be a little bit weird, a little bit Australian,
and this is not new in the slightest.
This is not like you, being weird?
What's going on here?
Thanks, thanks Andrew, that's kind.
Yeah, so I've recently rewatched a very, very beloved favourite program of mine from when
was a kid. In fact it might have even been made before I was a kid. It's a show called
Barjass. Are you familiar with that?
Am I familiar with it? Any of you lovely ladies care to join me in a Dutch oven?
Jason does not look impressed.
So many questions. So many questions. I am ready to watch it again.
Jason's obviously very surprised and shocked by this. So to give you some context, in Australia
there was a comedy group and a lot of these comedians or actors or writers or whatever
are still very active on different projects but they were called the D generation and they had a
program called the Late Show and it was a recurring program right it was a thing that was on broadcast
TV but they would occasionally do these weird specials and one thing that they did was called
Barjass and what they did was they went through a 1970s police drama called Bluey and they
raided the season's worth of footage and spliced together a completely different voice dubbed
program voicing as the actors themselves with these alternative characters and they took the
main character this rather portly gentleman from Bluey, I think that was his actual name from that
show, and called him Barjass and they turned the whole thing into this horrible toilet humor
fart comedy where he's just totally flatulent and making a fool of himself at the police station.
And it's one of the most Australian things you'll ever see. And you know, they've got,
they've got things like in the opening credits, Ann Burke played by Ann Burke, but the Ann Burkes
are spelled differently each time. And his offside or right hand man is known as Detective Glenn 20,
Glenn 20 being like a disinfectant spray here in Australia. So I just crack up watching this every
time. But I remember growing up being like six or seven years old thinking this is the most
hilarious thing because their voices didn't line up. So that's what I'm bringing into Media Corner
today. I don't know how accessible it is for people outside of Australia but I do think it's available
in the Combo Special with Alden Days which was another special they did for five bucks on
iTunes or something. So if you're looking for a weird piece of Australian culture check out Bar
Jacks. Jump on. I had that on VHS as well as the Best of the Late Show videos all on VHS.
Now all lost to me. So if it's on iTunes, I don't care. They could charge me 30 bucks if I can watch Bajas again
I'm up for it. This is that's only like 18 cents a week. So I think
I'm moving money in my wider budget right now. I'm creating a Bajas category
Oh Jason, you have to see yeah, I think this is I'll I will shout I'll buy you buy it for you
Jason, you need to see this. Even if you hate it, even if you hate it or think it's not funny at
all, it's just such an insight into a very particular period in Australia, mocking another
period in Australia, which may or may not be funny to our current period in Australia.
It's layers upon layers. This was 80s, 90s, 2000s, when was this? 90s, about the 70s, I think.
Okay, got it. Wow. Yeah, but deliberately absurd. I'm thinking about the action scenes that they play
because they portray this sort of fat barge ass character. He occasionally does like a running
scene, but it's the running scene from the 70s show. And then overdubbing from my memory serves,
they kind of just have him going. Yeah. One more pissy stunt, like grunts and stuff.
This is ridiculous. I will be searching YouTube for clips because surely they will be there
and then I will fire up my Australian iTunes and get in there. Get my VPN going.
Surely it's not geo-blocked. Surely you can get to it on a US account.
It might be too offensive for the American market. Remember people can say the F word
here on television. No that's true. No way! Oh yes. After a certain time slot you can get
get away with it. That's f***ing awesome! Alright, we're moving. That's it. We're out of here.
(laughing)
