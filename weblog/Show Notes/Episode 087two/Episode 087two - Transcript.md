Well, I reckon we should just give a very quick shout out to our newest One Prime Plus in-
OnePrimePlus.com! It's in the long game!
Dan M thank you Dan M for being our latest one prime plus in.
Dan M.
Dan the man does M stand for the man Dan the man.
Might we don't know it does now.
Alright thanks.
Thanks Dan.
Anyway keep your eyes out in the members feed there's gonna be a special episode talking about a little unexpected mystery device that Jason got recently a little bit.
Out of the ordinary not something that would normally be part of his everyday carry will put it that way and I wanted to ask you to guys cuz I know.
Him is very and said yes to this in the pole and I've got one of them do you want more him is filled with news always.
I love it like the more the more filled the better I say.
That's what that's what the people say they're forced to say it but that's what they say.
So does that translate to when it's my turn to edit the next episode you to adjust erased it's just.
Me entirely the more filled the better well that's also I think it is there's a there's a there's a thing there in the in the claws is about claws be states that it's text.
Audio we're still allowed to participate.
For now will keep your eyes out there will be more of a spell that is I have been blogging more recently and I should probably translate transfer some of those blog posts into.
Hemispheric news article should know I bet if you begged.
Martin he might allow you like you know pay a little tiny call a short block on page 6 yeah he might let that happen.
I might I might allow a link to your article elsewhere how about that.
Just straight up a link. Only after the EU or some other.
Regulatory body forced me to put it in there. Yeah it'll be behind the like GDPR requirement thing you gotta click through and then the cookies.
Gray text on a gray background.
Yeah.
Yep yep no underline.
And there'll be a little pop up that says you are being taken to canyon.blog/save this could be a phishing attempt you have been warned.
They may be trying to steal your identity. We don't know.
But yeah, that's all I had to say. So keep your eyes out in the feed members.
Thank you to our newest member. And yeah, more feld text on the way soon.
Should we tackle Arcadia June real quick? I think we mentioned Arcadia June about two hours ago,
but it's still going. It's June 10th slash 11th as we record. So we're about a third of the way
through. Surprise, surprise, Eric is still crushing. Natasha is still crushing. People
won't even play the games that she plays anymore. They just don't even bother. Both hilarious
and like, oh my gosh, what are we going to do? So please, please try. I mean, you know,
Ha ha, try to beat her scores.
And not only that, she posts them,
and then there's like straight up,
oh, I did that on my watch.
And I'm like, all right, I'm gonna just uninstall.
- She is very good on the watch.
- So it's still going, Arcadia June,
we're still going strong.
We've got through the end of June, obviously,
hence Arcadia June, and get the app.
I think we still have some free codes available too.
So if you want to get it
And don't necessarily have the means or whatever to get the app and want to grab a free one.
We've got a couple of those left.
So hit us up at what's our email?
Hello@hemisphericviews.com.
There it is. Thank you.
So to be that guy, but wasn't it done through Mastodon?
It was, it was, but I'm expanding our reach.
And those codes have come direct from the developer.
All right, so we've got a bit of follow up in here, Andrew.
Someone performed some sort of hem experiment on you.
What's happening?
- Yeah, this is the desktop stacks.
People will remember from our previous episode,
we talked about stacks, stacks of stacks.
I have been desktop stacking.
And do you know how the universe sometimes works
in such a way that you mention something
And then it just, you start seeing that same thing everywhere.
You know, you, you're interested in a car and then suddenly you see that
car on the road all the time.
Stacks no different.
So people may know about the guy called Rans.
He writes a blog.
He's been writing a blog for a long time.
Rans in Repose.
He's on Mastodon.
I saw a Mastodon post from Rans and he's saying, he must listen to Hemispheric
reviews because it was after we published and then I saw this toot and said a Mac OS
desktop organization strategy for you enable stacks stack by kind and date added and then
the view options icon size 24 bit small for me text size 14 bit big for me and label position
on the right and he said you're welcome now I took that as like interesting so I've been
doing my stacks I've been doing the giant icons as I mentioned last time and they were
kind of annoying me.
Are you still a hundred and hundred ninety?
No, I got too much.
So I am now stacking by kind and sorting by date added.
I am icon size 6464.
I am text size 14.
Okay, so I don't know I'm just trying with that label position on the right.
And it creates a lovely little list view.
It's quite nice.
You're able to look at on the right.
You're able to look at that every day and think this is okay.
It's neat and it's organized.
It's columnar.
I like it.
What I don't like is exactly the same thing you complained about Jason
Burke and that's that the stacks don't auto collapse.
Yeah, right.
I have them and then I go away and I come back four hours later and it's
open it's like no just I dealt with that just tuck it away just shut it down I
want that same feature but overall I haven't used it he I'm not a massive
desktop got a file on the desktop guy but the combination of your inspiration
and Rans optimization has led to this situation where I think I'm gonna keep
it the hemp experiment is has paid off but you're gonna turn off the side view
No, right? No labels on the side. I'm here for it
Have you all traveled recently, haha, no, did you bring your Nintendo switch with you?
So so, okay
Let's pretend Martin did bring his switch and then he was in his like hotel or or house rental wherever he went
Okay, and let me paint you a picture
He's playing his switch handheld when there's like a giant TV in this in this place. He's at that's away from home
What if he could play that Switch on that giant TV
in this hotel/rental house/whatever?
Wouldn't that be something?
But, packing areas, you know,
you don't have a ton of room to pack stuff.
You don't want to bring the whole Switch dock.
What if the dock was as big as a phone charger,
is what I'm saying.
What if?
So I traveled recently with this lovely device
called the Genki, G-E-N-K-I, I'm going to assume,
ConvertDock, which is no bigger than an iPhone charger thing,
like one of those little brick deals.
And it's got a USB-C, a USB-A, and an HDMI port on it.
- That's all you need.
- Plug this bad, plug this thing into the wall,
HDMI out to the TV, USB-C to the Switch,
you've got a full Switch dock in the palm of your hand.
It's amazing, works great, super awesome device.
I've now used it in the real world while traveling
and can say 10 out of 10, it is absolutely great
because it takes up no space
and allows you to connect your Switch to a regular TV
and it charges it and does all that stuff as well.
So 10 out of 10 for that product.
- I noticed it had US plugs on the back of it there,
which makes it very neat and foldable.
- They sell the other ones as well.
I don't think they fold
'cause all the other plugs are huge,
but they do have the other versions for other plug types.
- Fantastic, I want that.
- If you're looking for a Switch dock.
- I wasn't, but I am now.
- Right there. - Look at that thing.
- It's really good.
I mean, technically you could use this at home,
the same and not have the giant dock,
but yeah, it's really great.
So I highly recommend that ConvertDock.
And there's even, they make a smaller one too.
I'm not quite sure what the difference is
'cause I have the original one from way back when,
but great device all around, done deal, 10 out of 10.
- Is this gaming corner?
- I was just gonna ask,
do you use this thing like a fidget cube now?
With the little clicking in and out.
(click)
And it is kind of satisfying.
(click)
Can we just extend Gaming Corner for just- I know- I know time, type 45 and all that.
45!
Type 45.
45!
I love it every time he edits he says an extended episode and you check screenshots from my edits and it's like 2.30 in the morning. I'm toiling for you people.
Breath of the Wild. Not Breath of the Wild, the other one.
Tears of the Kingdom.
Thank you it's fun it's a lot of fun I'd forgotten how much I love Zelda from the first from the breath of the wild I play breath of the wild so much and I don't rush through these games I like explore nooks and crannies and like don't do it efficiently I'm just like living a life of Lincoln in the forest right it is so much fun.
It's 11 out of 10.
It's the bet is just the best and it's harder than breath of oil I haven't gotten even that way through but I think it's harder than breath of the wild.
I think.
I think it's just diff I think there's just different challenges in this one I don't know if it's like from a pure difficulty standard if it's necessarily harder I think it might just be.
Different things you need to do like I don't know how to really articulate that but it's like different.
Muscle motors that you need to like do for this game for I think it's probably the building bit which is really fun but also very fiddly.
I can't try to get things gluing together in the right order and place it you know that I'm not very.
Patient with that stuff but the game itself incredible love it the only thing that I would add.
Never having as I said I'm these devices whenever I've heard breath of the wild said over and over again on podcast it just sounds like that would stink.
All right, Jason says robot. I built Australia. What does that mean?
I did. I built Australia. I built your entire country out of Lego. I traveled to Canada
recently and picked up Australia. So I built Australia for you.
Oh my goodness. What is going on? We need to picture this for the show notes.
That is not what I expected.
It is an exact replica of Australia, like point for point.
Everything that is Australia is in this build.
Is that a Qantas plane?
Well, check the show notes, listeners, but we're basically looking at like a Lego diorama with floating white clouds and aeroplanes, some sort of outback windmill.
I know what's going on.
What is that thing in the middle?
Is that a pub?
I think that's the pub from Crocodile Dundee.
Of course it is.
Don't you think? That's how I took it.
Because didn't it have like a corrugated metal roof?
Yeah.
Where's the big pineapple? Where's Uluru?
Well, I mean, it's just, it can't...
Where are all the things that people know but can't name from Western Australia?
Wave Rock!
No, this is it. This is all that Australia has.
I am gonna get a little construction person mini fig to put in there.
In Hy-Vee's.
With a Hy-Vee's vest.
Yes.
So I'll put that in there.
Please do that.
That'll, then everybody will get it.
You're welcome for building Australia.
Just make sure you put Hy-Vee's guy on the left.
Well, obviously.
I mean, he wouldn't be in Sydney.
That's good.
Why would he be in, like, that doesn't make sense.
You could take my Lego mini figs of Martin that I built the other day and put him on the right.
That's a good point. I should do that.
I want to know, though, we're going to get back to what Jason's showing us.
But Andrew, I loved what you made and what you posted on Flickr and stuff.
It was fantastic. Just this little photo of me and my family as Lego.
Did you build it and then go, oh, that's Martin?
Or did you build it deliberately?
I got halfway there.
I started putting it together and I was like, hang on.
I saw the hair and then the guy holding the camera.
So, and I was like, that's Martin.
And then I was like, I had eggs and I was like, chicken liquid.
And it just, it just went from there.
Yes.
Yeah.
And it's like, and then the little baby, like this is the first time I've had a little baby Lego like that.
They're adorable.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I cracked up when I saw it.
I was like, wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's me.
It was totally you.
And Jason, how do you rate the experience of building Australia?
Oh, it was easy. It was much faster than I thought it was going to be.
It looks so big, but no problem. It was just super quick.
It's like I blinked and then all of a sudden it was there.
And while we're on the topic of Commonwealth countries,
how was the trip to Canada?
It was lovely. I was up there for five days.
You didn't set it on fire, did you? Please tell me it wasn't you.
I did not. It was, it was on fire before I got there. That was not my doing.
Climate change. Climate change is real, people. It's drying out.
- Just getting-- - To make sure, it is.
Yeah, things are not in a good way right now.
I went up there to make sure that Canada was real,
'cause that's something we have to do from time to time.
Just give it a once over.
Is it still here?
Does it exist?
Is it real?
It is real, so that's good.
Checks out.
It was a nice, lovely time.
Went up there, had a lot of camera time, which was great.
I was, I got away from things, just went and got lost,
and that was nice.
And it was just a lovely time.
Met up with a friend of the show,
Scotty Jackson, met up with him up there in the Canada,
'cause he's, apparently he's Canadian, who knew?
He was up there.
- Did he write you a shortcut?
- Yeah, oh, that was basically the whole reason I went,
was I had a couple of shortcuts that I needed to have made,
and I just couldn't be bothered.
So I was like, well, I'll just fly to Canada,
and put him under duress to build shortcuts for a week
and yeah, everybody wins.
It worked out really well.
- It sounds like in the spirit of shortcuts
and the underlying complexity of the system,
you chose the quickest way to go and do that.
- Yeah, yeah, it was like either open shortcuts on my phone
or book an extensive travel trip to another country
to have someone else do it for me.
And that worked out nicely.
So did you pay him with some loonies?
Oh no, I didn't pay anything.
No, he just did it out of the kindness of his heart.
He actually apologized the whole time.
He apologized.
That's on Brad.
Did you go to his yoga studio by the way?
Yeah.
You remember from his desk review?
Oh yes, I did.
Yeah.
I did three sessions there.
Actually.
It was great.
Excellent.
That's good.
Yeah.
It's real.
It actually exists.
Could you fit a yoga mat between his computer screen and that TV?
Several, several.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The, and the bottom TV fireplace was, was there as well.
Yeah.
That's brilliant.
I love it.
Yeah.
It all checked out.
It was all, yeah, like it, you know, we didn't, no one could believe it, but it was real.
So can you give us your best Canadian accent now?
Uh, no, I can't.
Um, sorry.
Was that it?
No.
Did you get "oot" and a "boot"?
Do the Canadians, do Canadians say "oot" and a "boot"?
Is that a Canadian thing or is that something else?
That's all they say.
That's 90% of the language.
Yeah.
It was actually really weird because you sort of never knew what you were going to get.
It was either, "Hmm, I can't quite tell, like you have an accent of some kind, but I'm not
quite sure."
Um, down, you know, over to obviously just 100% French.
So okay.
And then there was like the stereotypical kind of Canadian accent, but you never really
knew what you were going to get depending on who you would talk to.
So just different scenarios were like, oh, okay, this is very different.
Got it.
Nice.
All right.
I'm glad you've confirmed that because there have been times that I've met Canadians or
watched videos of Canadians and thought, oh, I can't actually tell very well where exactly
they're from.
But then there have been times where I've heard of you and gone, ah, I've picked that
Even in like kids videos that we've stuck on for Mac.
Right, I've got, ah, just the way that they sang that
in the song, I reckon that's Canadian.
But the fact that you said that it's a bit varied,
I feel better about myself.
- Right, but like Australia, everyone, it's very obvious.
- Yeah, mate, gotcha, good one.
(laughing)
- In whatever.
- Yep, there it is, perfect.
- Struth.
- Yep, so that's travel corner.
- And did you travel with apps when you went there?
Oh, right, yeah, this is a quickie, I swear.
- Top 25.
♪ 45 ♪
- So the 5G situation was not great for me
when I was up there.
Leaves a little bit to be desired.
But I noticed that certain apps really performed poorly
under like kind of reduced cell connection,
where I don't know, it's either super high latency
or low speed or just not a great cell signal.
And some apps were just totally fine, but dog slow,
which, okay, sure, that's to be expected.
But others just flat out don't work for some reason,
which I found to be very interesting.
And it made me really think like,
it might be worth from a traveling standpoint
to have several different applications for the same task
ready to go when traveling so that if for some reason one is acting weird, you have
like a fallback.
It's like my email app was just falling all over itself.
But if I loaded up a different one, it worked eventually.
And I just like, I don't understand why an app would act so differently under a bad cell
connection.
It seems like they're all using the same networking stack.
So like, what's the deal there?
But I guess it's kind of a PSA of if you're going to travel, maybe think about having
multiple backups of apps for different critical things.
Like if you're storing all your travel stuff in your email and you can't get to your email,
you're kind of screwed.
So like maybe have an alternate way to get to that.
So that was it.
That was my only observation.
I don't have any like real scientific.
It's just weird into that.
It was just like weird.
Yeah, I didn't.
I could not understand how one app seemingly could not connect when others could.
I don't know.
So PSA done.
It's probably the CIA.
The Canadian intelligence agency.
That's right.
That's right.
They were, they kept on knocking on the doors of the email provider saying, excuse me, would
it be possible at all if you could please just share Jason's email with us, just please,
would that be okay?
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Please.
all that pleasing, you know, just slows things down. And sorry. You have to sorry. For every
please, there is a sorry. Sounds like we'd really be at home there, I reckon, Australians.
Sounds like Australia of the North. I'm very interested in a Canada-Australia
mashup. I'm very interested in that. Seriously, this entire country, at least among white people,
is just walking along footpaths and if you come within 30 centimeters of someone's personal space
or have that little thing where you go on the wrong side there's about five sorries exchanged
and most of the conversation that happens at any checkout or counter is sorry. Everyone's
constantly sorry for no apparent reason. I'm sorry to hear that. There are more sorries than thank
yous and then people say thank you for the sorries and probably sorry for too many thank yous. It's
exhausting. Do you know what I'm sorry about? What are you sorry about? I'm sorry that that Reddit has
been in shitified. Technical term. Reddit has done what all social media companies chasing
growth ultimately do. They've forgotten about their user base, the community, as they chase
the dollars. And they've destroyed the goodwill of many, many people. And I would suggest that
this will probably be the beginning of the end of Reddit as a viable, useful service. Because
While some people will continue to use it, all the really high value contributors who
are bought into what's going on will not. The moderators are going to go away and they have
screwed it by screwing one of the best iOS apps that has ever been made and that is Apollo.
This app, you may not use Reddit, so you may not use Apollo, but this app was a delight.
It's just a beautiful app. He got the shakedown from Reddit saying that because he was using the
their API, then it would be a shame to see your app go away.
Please give us lots of money,
more money than he would in fact make.
They were asking him to pay about $20 million per annum
just to use their API.
Christian Selig, the developer said,
"Eh, I'm not gonna pay that.
"I am just gonna shut my app down."
And with that, so many people using that app
to access Reddit, I just don't think
there's a future for Reddit.
And so they have successfully shot themselves in the foot beautifully.
And so we had it with Twitter.
We had Elon Musk decide to be a total douche and destroy Twitter.
And now we have, um, see, this is the thing.
He doesn't have the same name recognition.
Huffman is it the CEO of Reddit who has now destroyed or in the
process of destroying Reddit.
So farewell, Apollo.
Thank you for the years of service.
Farewell Reddit, thank you for your years of service.
And I'm going to miss not being able to type in Google search
term here, space Reddit, and get a reasonable answer
in the foreseeable future.
Because no doubt that will become
somewhat of a spam farm with all the moderators disappearing.
So thank you to Apollo.
Not thank you to Reddit, you suck.
Back to blogs we go.
[LAUGHS]
(laughing)
- Like I said about Nintendo before,
I mean, I have used Reddit before and I've tried Apollo,
which I thought was a beautifully designed app,
but here's a little not so big bombshell.
I just don't really see the point of Reddit.
Never have. - I'll take.
- Do either of you use it heavily?
- No.
- Other than stumbling on something?
I've seen the, look,
I'm completely brushing over entire communities here,
I know people find value in these things.
I'm not questioning it personally for people, but as a tool,
does it really offer anything that various other services don't already offer
technically speaking?
So I use it to follow some communities of like really specific interests.
So even almost as like a, almost as like a Facebook replacement.
So I follow the Perth server and that's kind of like a group
forum.
That's a fun kind of forum just to keep up with local news and what's going on
without me having to read our god awful newspaper.
So I like that.
There's a few other communities where I follow for enjoyment and a bit of information.
Apps will often have a good little community if you're using them, if they don't have a
dedicated forum.
It's a good place to go.
And also, if you want a technical solution to something, so often you get a good answer
by searching through the Reddit archives, because it's real people that are contributing
stuff and it's real conversation.
So often now Google search results have been destroyed by all the content farms. So when you try and find something you just get those stupid ridiculous ad infested listicles that don't give you the answer. Whereas like Reddit is almost like a source of these answers so efficiently.
So yeah, I liked it. I got value out of it. I liked Apollo.
It was a really good, I never used,
like if I try and use the Reddit app or even the Reddit website,
the new version or the old version, I didn't love them,
but Apollo just made everything so fluid.
And so it's sad to see it go.
Yeah. I,
I think Reddit is great for like niche kind of topics mostly where you just,
you're not going to find that in a general search. Um,
I don't use, I've never, I don't use Apollo. I don't use the website.
I follow a handful of subreddits, uh, via RSS,
which I'm assuming will be shut down at some point as well. I would guess,
I don't know, but I always found that to be the most useful way to follow subreddits.
I wasn't interacting a ton.
It was more about just kind of getting the information in the only,
I guess the only real interaction I've had is when I did the, um, the standalone,
uh, touch ID button, there was like kind of a thread about that at one point.
And I kind of got in on that and, and posted like the couple of blog posts
that I did about it and different ways in which I did certain things.
And it was, it was just a good way to kind of build, I felt like I was sort
of putting back into the system of like, when somebody eventually wants to try
this, they're probably going to find this thread and then find all these
sort of myriad ways of doing it and different, different paths to not go
down or pass to go down versus just trying to find like disparate web
searches that were not related at all.
Because like the, the majority of places that have good quote SEO are not
building standalone touch ID buttons.
Like those two things don't overlap.
So Reddit felt more like a place for that.
Um, something else will replace it.
I'm sure.
Um, you know, you mentioned Twitter, which, you know, I haven't been on that in a long
time, but a lot of people have shifted over to other places.
So something else will take, take its place.
I think, I guess the only part that I'm concerned is probably too strong of a
word, but the amount of stuff that is packed into Reddit right now, if it
somehow gets walled off from being able to be accessed via standard searches and so forth.
I do see that being like a pretty big loss. Like if that could all somehow be in archive.org or
whatever, it doesn't have to be archive.org, but whatever. That's the piece that I see missing
because there is a lot of just institutional knowledge that has been dumped into Reddit,
Shoveled in there trucked in there. Whatever metaphor is bigger than that
just
Absolutely gobs of information are in reddit and nowhere else
if that somehow
Gets blocked off by a paywall or just gone
That's a huge loss to just information on the internet
This is further evidence that monolithic sites that host a whole heap of community
contributed information
Is not the future. So we've seen Twitter jump the you just you're just at the mercy of
somebody and
individuals chasing
Money at the end of the day and where money is there it will corrupt it corrupts. Absolutely
so I think I think we we as a society need to accept the fact that
the corporate approach to
Community content is not the answer. We've seen it happen with Twitter. We've seen it happen with myspace
We've seen it happen with
now reddit
Facebook how long is that gonna keep going for I mean it's dying a death isn't it?
It's not really got any great content on it anymore if it ever has and metas looking great with the vision pro coming out
- so good strategy there, so I just think I think there's got to be there's a new and new approach is required
I'm glad you put it that way
and you too, Jason, saying words like dumped and shoveled,
because to make it clear, I've used Reddit before.
I respect its significance as an informational resource.
I've stumbled upon things.
I see that it gives people joy,
but whenever I tried to use it with or without Apollo,
it was just this gigantic information dump.
And I just went,
I don't know why I've made an account in here.
So I think something like a Fediverse
or better ways of searching and finding information
that are hosted with different people,
that's more compelling.
And then we don't have these sad instances,
like you said, where some corporate controlled thing
just dies and everyone loses their stuff.
- Yeah, I don't know if this analogy works,
but I'm gonna use it anyway.
So in security world,
we always talk about like security versus convenience,
where it's either really, really convenient,
but maybe not so secure,
or it's super, super secure, less convenient.
I feel like all this, these community things are kind of similar in the fact
that they're like convenience versus availability.
So it's either really, really convenient to just put a bunch of shit somewhere,
like a Twitter where you just click three buttons, you have an account and
you're dumping everything in there.
But then availability becomes more problematic on the other side because
it's either walled off somehow, or you can't access it, there's no API.
So I feel like convenience versus availability is now the issue we're
facing with these communities in that the availability part in something like
this federated whatever the hell we're calling this stuff it's more difficult I
mean it's not super difficult but let's be real it's harder to get on to all
this federated stuff and understand how it all works than to just jump on a
Twitter or a reddit that's got a sign in with Google and you're done like there's
There's nothing easier than one click.
So I think we're in that now of trying to figure out, I don't think we've solved security
either.
I think we're still very much in a battle there.
