Hello, you're listening to Martin, and Martin only.
What's the deal you're thinking?
Well before our full episode comes out this week, which isn't far away, don't worry, we
thought we'd do a little special bonus HV mini episode.
Now if you've been following the feed for a while you'll notice that we don't really
do bonus episodes that much.
It's actually something that we reserve for our one prime plus Patreon membership scheme.
But this time we thought we'll do a little bonus.
And you might recall that in our last episode we spoke a little bit about Severance, the
Apple TV+ show.
We couldn't resist but continue talking about it, and we thought, let's relegate it to a
bonus episode.
There are some spoilers in case you're worried about continuing listening, but let me tell
you, it's worth watching if you haven't seen the show before.
We wanted to talk about it a little bit more, so skip ahead if you don't want to hear this,
or stay for the fun in this HV Mini episode.
And if you do like the HV mini format and you'd like some more bonus episodes, if you
haven't considered our One Prime Plus membership scheme, I'd suggest you have a look.
Visit oneprimeplus.com to become a supporter and for only $2 US a month, you get members
only access to a particular channel for One Prime Plus subscribers in our Discord group.
You can join live streams.
We recently had our announced trivia corner.
We had a live watch of Crocodile Dundee last year.
be more on the way. Just ridiculous, I know, but it's good fun. You've also got the monthly
Hemispheric Views newsletter with extra stories and blog posts from us. And of course, the whole
reason to come is the member only podcast that comes out at least once a month, Hemispheric
Views One Prime Plus, we've spoken about the experience of being podcasters, things about our
creative and career backgrounds, ridiculous things like democracy sausages recently,
what it means to live in a constitutional monarchy for me and Andrew. And yeah, just have a look,
you get access to all the previous newsletters, all 21 current episodes. And as a bit of a teaser,
later this month, we're going to be talking about our iPad home screens. And that was actually
a suggested topic from one of our one prime plus subscribers might sound awesome and really
interesting to you or really boring. Either way, check it out and enjoy this mini episode before
the full one this week. Thanks so much.
Can I tell you something that's worth 800 Andrew Thumbs?
You could try. Severance.
Did either of you check out that Apple book that they put out?
Yeah, I read it. I have not read it yet. I'm reading it.
I'm reading it. Yeah, fantastic.
Reading it tonight. So good.
The Twitter accounts, the book, I won't ruin it for you, anyone else has read it,
but if you're watching the show, like the whole trans media thing they're doing is great. And
And I'm already seeing a lot of fan artwork and stuff come out online.
This has really tapped into people's psyche.
I can't figure out how much of the- How many other websites are actually Apple TV severance people and how much of it is neatnik?
I don't think you understand how incredibly wonderful this world is.
Are either of you getting this?
This is the best show happening right now in our lifetime.
You're going that big.
It's huge.
You're going that big.
Is this better than Breaking Bad? Is this better than Game of Thrones?
Breaking who? Never heard of them. Game of what? Boring.
I would say the concept definitely is at a minimum because no one can watch this show and walk away
not thinking, "Hmm, all of that is completely true. It's just how extreme the situation is
that's different." I see truth in all of this. It's amazing. It is- I'm actually speechless
about it right now. It's so good. Does your corporation have values? Because Lumen has values.
If you have not at least watched the first episode, find a way to do it. It's a must watch.
Amongst our audience who participate in our Discord, we started a thread under the Media
Corner section for Severance. And that thread has just exploded. There is so much activity
in that thread. It is just incredible. And it's hard to know when to go. You can only go into it
when you're fully up to date on all the episodes because you don't want to be spoiled.
But don't risk it.
But it just goes to show how much this has captured the imaginations of the people who
engaged with us. And I would hope that it's hitting more of a mainstream audience as well.
Although I don't feel like I'm getting the same like Ted Lasso buzz or anything like that.
I don't hear about it at all from the-
I've seen Reddit stuff as well.
The norms.
People are talking about it.
But just day-to-day conversations with other people, I've yet to hear somebody say,
"Oh my gosh, Severance." Like, yeah, exactly. But you're right, like the Ted Lasso thing,
I mean, and it could just be that's a much more broad acceptance, because it's just kind of a,
you know, it has nothing to do with soccer. I think we know that. It's just kind of a feel good,
happy show. But this one is like very, it's pretty hardcore. And I love it.
Although I wouldn't be surprised. And I'm not saying that it's going to take off and be the
biggest show ever. It is. Maybe that's just the genre it's in. But there is this point about,
you know, it's not broadcast TV or the cinema. Natasha and I, for example, watched Encanto
pretty much the moment it came out, because we thought, oh, this is interesting. We had the night
free, let's put it on. And we thought it was pretty good. We weren't going nuts over it,
Like some people have been but about a month later it blew up and now everyone's singing this we don't talk about Bruno song
How does that song go? Can you just give us a bar to that? I'm not singing that song. We also don't talk about Bruno
I've already said too much
I've literally no idea what you're talking about
Yeah
So there's this particular song in the movie about this character Bruno and he's a controversial figure in the broader family
And the song was about how they don't talk not to be confused with the other
Similarly animated movie that also has a song about Bruno, which is like silencio Bruno. I think there's a song about it
But they definitely say so little sure. Yeah, I get I get those two
All the time. Yeah all the time frustrating. It's like but yeah, so it was about a month later that
It permeated through the masses and everyone discovered what it was and that's because everyone's got endless
Recommendations on Netflix or Disney or whatever. I wouldn't be surprised if severance takes a bit longer. It could be a sleeper
Yeah I could see that but the one difference is that this is the best show you should be watching right now that's the difference you get a lot of recommendations forget all that.
This is serious.
This is like a real recommendation this is an Andrew recommendation.
Yeah it is a retro recommendation my recommendation system is not working in my own home I am can I and this seems like a problem.
I don't like this is concerning because I don't like you either I said to her multiple times you need to watch severance she watched half of episode 1.
And has not gone back to it and I saw her the other day thumbing through the Netflix recommendations you know just like looking for something like why are you wasting your time there is severance right there waiting to be watched.
Why were the lights off in the lounge room when you're watching it would you establish a mood of melancholy and.
She was in the bedroom and I think maybe that just I think maybe it was.
That's a good point that's a good point I want to that you need to have proper lighting number one.
You're not just watching it midday with the sun glaring out half the screen no dark room lights off.
Quiet because there's a lot of visual it's a lot of audio cues you want to pick up on phone down no other device you're not doing anything else this is not.
Save yourself from the rest of society.
This is not I'm gonna browse my my time no no you take that phone throw it out the window.
Okay put it in a lock now you put it in a locker you swap your ID badges over.
And then you're in San Francisco.
- For your own home, yeah.
(laughing)
- Take the SIM card out,
you gotta put it in one of those little mesh bags
so like the satellites can't get to it, all of that.
And then devote yourself to it.
And I'm not saying that because it's somehow boring.
I'm saying that because if you look away,
you're gonna miss gold nuggets.
You're that person panning for gold in the stream,
looking all around at the birds,
all those rocks just going right by.
No, you wanna be down there getting those nuggets
and saying, "Look at me, I have got gold
'cause this show is gold."
- Sorry, I would just argue that it's TV
that's made with the sensibility or style of cinema.
You absorb yourself in it like you're in a dark room.
Even the theme, the theme is spectacular
and those like piano motifs that you hear through the show.
I look at that theme
and even though it's nothing like 007,
it's made with the same kind of purpose or feeling
that a 007 theme for a movie
Says something about what's to follow in the story and a lot of TV things don't really do that as well like the Simpsons is a classic one it's long and you sit through it this is a mood set up so people need to commit to it.
Seeing in the most recent episode I think it's episode 6 is that the one that just came out.
Yes careful.
I don't I'm an idiot and just didn't really pick it up or it was an amazing piece of cinematography could be both.
Where they panned up and they were using the green carpet and then panning into the white walls of the office environment.
But I was like what am I looking at what am I seeing is that snow is that grass and I was like oh it's the carpet of the office it was just this gradual pan through and it just presented this stark imagery of suddenly the office and it's changed.
It was just little things like that and that's a probably a bad example but what I'm trying to say is that so much care is put into every shot.
It's thought about and it's meaningful and it's it gives the viewer something to chew on everything's there for a purpose there's no wasted effort.
It's a great example because they're trying to give you something that you need to really pay attention to so that you understand it and absorb it feels clear but at the same time they visually disorienting you in a way that's reminiscent of the severance of the characters have.
So where are you what time is it what time of day is it like what's going on it's it gives you that feeling.
Yeah can I ask you guys a bonus question.
Do you ever watch TV shows whoever the characters are do you ever assign them to people that you know in real life.
Sometimes sometimes.
I have done that with severance.
Of course.
Would you care to know who is who and I'm curious what others may think as well I don't think this is spoiling right is it spoiling if I just say their names.
Yeah that's my only concern is a new characters really introduced or anything you get the characters and outset that their personalities are fairly well set.
If we have a question you need to explain a character just a general set of attributes would probably be enough in case clarification my plot points.
So I've assigned everyone within the hemispheric views universe a character.
Okay so here we go.
Martin you are Mark.
Okay that checks out that check out for you totally team lead.
Andrew you are Irving.
John to tour I can see that yeah and I can explain why we may need to do a spoiler chapter I'm not sure it's hard for me to explain without kind of going into it.
I've assigned myself, Heli.
- Oh, not Dylan, not Dylan.
Okay, interesting.
All right.
- Be a bit of both, really.
- Adam is actually Dylan.
(laughing)
The creator of Lumen.Industries.
And I hope he still talks to me after saying that.
I have a feeling he's okay being Dylan.
But being that there was only three of us on the show,
I had to pick somebody else to be Dylan.
So he's gonna be Dylan.
So, just quickly, I've labeled Martin as Mark because yes, he's the office leader person.
He's setting the culture, isn't he?
He likes things to be the way they're supposed to be, right?
Follow the rules.
He pretends that he's flexible and diplomatic.
He does, but it's very obvious that he's just doing that to manipulate you.
So, we get it.
And then the last piece of that is that even though he is like that, he's still open to
maybe thinking maybe something's going on that needs to be investigated.
Still going to follow the rules.
A little bit skeptical though.
A little bit.
Good point.
So Andrew, for you, rule follower all the way, these are the 10 things we need to do.
These are what we're doing.
Get back to work.
Stop messing around.
Stop walking around.
back to your desk and get what needs to be done. But he's the kind of guy where you kind of poke
him just enough, you can get him to go do other shit that has nothing to do with work pretty
easily. So he puts on this big show like he's all business and you're like, come on, let's just go
do this other crap for a while. He's like, all right, fine. So that's you.
He also knows all corporate principles and philosophy verbatim.
Yes, absolutely.
Absolutely.
I feel so seen right now.
We don't call you the business phenomenon.
Yeah, but the sneaky, like not doing what I meant to do when it was just a little bit of a push.
That is so true.
It doesn't take much.
There's just like a little hill you got to get him over.
It's very small, just a little shove and he's right there just doing everything he's not supposed to be doing.
Having a little sip of schnapps in the break room.
Anyway, myself, I've labelled Helly because I don't want to be there and would not probably look past chopping off my own fingers to get out of there.
And then, I don't know, I reckon one crack at those terminals and you'd be like, I just want to stay here all my whole life.
Look at these things, piece of beauty.
Who designed this typeface?
It's great. I really want to just take this all in.
Look at the fonts on these walls, like, wow.
Look at the animation as you cycle and all that been open so beautifully what an experience.
Oh gosh and I obviously not.
You might be Milchick actually.
Oh wow melon party.
Yeah we're gonna have to put a spoiler in here there's no way anybody can go through this and not just have it completely ruined.
I mean obviously I don't know Adam super well we have interviewed him on a previous show which I recommend everybody go and listen to because he's just.
This is the founder of OMG.lol.
This is correct yes Adam OMG.lol he did legally change his last name to OMG.
Probably actually sorry to interrupt he probably is worth about 1 billion dollars now because link trees worth 1.3 billion.
1.3 yeah so I think he's like neck and neck with that I think.
Adam don't give don't give up your patreon because you're sitting on a billion dollar nest egg at this point
Exactly. Yeah. I also saw that link tree has
230 employees Wow and OMG dot lol has like a
Fraction of an employee so you tell me who's doing better
Anyway, yeah, he's Dylan because I just I don't know
He feels like a Dylan to me just always with the smart comment this you know
snarky thing coming out of left field talking shit, collecting his little finger traps.
He gets the work done though, doesn't he? Like Dylan is achievement plus.
He does. Yeah, somehow he talks all that shit and still makes Lumen.Industries that gets picked up
by frigging Apple TV like executives and like people on the show are retweeting things that he's
phenomenal. We're going to link all of his stuff. Yeah.
Meaning Dylan's, I just called him Dylan.
Adam's stuff in the show notes because you have to see it.
It's just-
Do you think he's at the level where he's just now won a caricature as an achievement award?
I don't think he's real.
I don't think he's a real person at this point because there's just too much
coming out of there that feels like maybe AI is actually real and no one has really told us about
it but we're actually witnessing it right now.
If he is actually a human being who is real and fleshy I think it's actually deserving of waffles I think it's beyond the character.
Absolutely yeah for sure.
Straight to the waffle.
If I had his home address I would like grub hub him some waffles tomorrow.
Can we maybe maybe we can send his outie like a $25 voucher for Wendy's.
For pips.
Yeah pips.
Yeah.
As long as it's VIP section because you know.
He deserves it.
I sit amongst the rest of them.
So the these these matchups could change as the show progresses but that's where I feel like right right now.
Can I just one other thing is there any chance that Martin could be what's her name the boss lady.
Cable.
No no I couldn't do that.
No especially not after the last one.
How can you simultaneously be an atheist and a Catholic that's what I want to know.
I'm looking at that flamingo in your background and just wondering does it play a larger part in your religious framework?
Oh the eye is a camera it's always on you.
I also dress up in floral garments after the show just to you know attend you know handmade markets and you know disperse the word of Kier.
I swear we're gonna shut up about seven now sorry about the editing job required there look at that mark coming through yeah classic mark.
Yeah it's like we couldn't resist we had to talk about it for another 10 15 minutes I can't shut the I can't shut I know I know I'm not incapable.
I'm incapable we are going I'm just gonna let everyone know I don't know where this is gonna go in the show but when this is over.
We're doing a like a rewatch like a group rewatch and we're going to watch every episode.
I think we'll just do like what we did with the movie where we just do it via like a big
zoom thing with everybody and then we're just going to pause it like every 15 minutes to
just discuss.
Okay.
Okay.
I think I know what has to happen.
Right.
So we're going to have this share play watch with center stage which will be really distracting
through FaceTime.
On top of that anyone who attends when we eventually do it I reckon needs to wear monochromatic
or pastel colors, no labels on clothing,
and you can bring your own melon to the event too.
Could be watermelon, could be rock melon/cantaloupe,
honeydew, whatever, just make sure
that it's not riddled with listeria.
- Can I wear a short-sleeved business shirt?
- Oh, of course. - Brilliant.
- I would expect nothing less, yeah.
- That's very milkshake of you, yeah.
- Greed, okay, so that's that.
- And for everyone who needs a break,
we'll have a break room running as well,
where you can adjourn for a bit of light reading.
Might be a little bit repetitive, but you'll enjoy it.
- Oh no.
- I want a wellness center.
- But Andrew, please make sure that in the transmission
of any wellness messages, you do not indicate any reaction
that is stronger than another for something that you like.
- Can I get a hug?
- Yeah, you can request a hug.
- Remember when I said that we were gonna
actually stop talking about it?
I lied.
We're not gonna stop.
- Maybe not.
- Okay.
