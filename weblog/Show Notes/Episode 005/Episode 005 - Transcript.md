This is like a big deal already, I can tell. This whole like podcast thing. Because, let me tell you
why. The reason I know that something is a big deal is that I am now having nightmares about it.
I've actually, to be honest, the postman, whenever he does visit, he's worked out that our doorbell
goes for about 35 seconds or something. And it sounds like an old Soviet folk song.
So whenever he comes, he presses it. He never knocks the door, he presses it. I open the door
and he's dancing like he's bobbing up and down holding the package every time.
Wait, wait, why does your doorbell do? Is this something you've implemented yourself? Or this
is just something that you got for free? We're talking about a really cheap,
run-of-the-mill doorbell that I think we got from Aldi. And Natasha went through every single option.
I think there's like 20 to 30 options
So we said they're listening to every single one and she chose the longest and most comical one
Which the family has now cottoned on to so when they pop around
They tap it and then guess what they do. They tap it again. Tap it again. Yeah double tap
They call that the double tap in Australia. I'm I'm I'm in a weird spot with my doorbell now that we're doing doorbell hour
We got one of those, you know home home kitty
fancy ones with the camera and all that stuff because you know, why why wouldn't you?
But and I don't know if this is just like a weird COVID thing or something, but we put it in and we
obviously moved during COVID. So that's possible. Nobody wants to touch anything, but like no one
will ever press it. And I'm not sure if it's because it kind of I mean, they're pretty,
at least in the United States, like these like doorbell camera thingies are like,
they're not new by any stretch, everyone knows what they are. But no one wants to press the button,
they'll knock, or if it's a package they'll just throw it on the door and leave.
But yeah, no one wants to press the thing, so I'm not really sure what that's about.
If it is a germ thing, I mean, for years pre-COVID I've looked like a total fool walking up to the
button at pedestrian crossings at traffic lights and using my elbow or my knee. I will actually do
do like a huge knee-high kick and tap it.
Yeah, yeah, for sure.
For years, people looked at me like I was odd, and now it all makes sense.
I've been preparing for this and I never knew it.
Do you guys have the little tiny button ones, or like the bigger, like you could hit it
with the broad side of a tree and it'd be fine?
It's the big ones, and it's that kind of very unsatisfying button where you don't think
it's actually done anything.
It's just kind of like, "Dick, dick, dick."
Yeah, there's no detent on it.
It's just like a kind of, is it broken?
Is it?
Yeah.
And everybody has to smash it a few times.
And then every person that walks up subsequent won't trust that the person's already pushed
it.
And so they got to do it too.
Yeah.
Oh, there'll be like 13 people standing at the corner and the like 14th person comes
up and they're like, I'm sure none of you touched it.
So I'm going to do it.
And then you've been there so long already that when they do it, it like almost immediately
changes and you're like, oh, they feel so satisfied now.
I just want to segue from this for a second. I have an official and very brief retraction
to make. Yeah, you might recall on an episode of this very show that I said that I thought
that I would be bothered by not seeing a second hand in an always on display mode on the Apple
Watch. I do remember that. I was incorrect, which means I caved. Wow. Yes. I love it. I decided.
You love it? Yes. It was the weekend and I thought I gotta do this. I can't resist. Yeah.
What did you get?
Fist pumping. Well, this is the thing. And I was reminded by what you said, Andrew,
about Apple Store shopping experiences. So maybe this is not the best time to bring it up. Yours
were more negative. We went to South Sydney and I said, I just have to go and do it. Had the whole
COVID style Apple Store experience and had to get a stainless steel Apple Watch. I needed a shiny one.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, that's the thing.
So now I sound like, oh, Martin, didn't you say you were cheap?
Well, maybe with microphones.
I don't know.
Watches are different.
But for a couple of years now, I've had this, you know, the link bracelet ones?
Natasha got me that one a couple of years ago.
That's the best.
Yeah.
But the slight difference in tone always bothered me.
So I caved and I just wanted to say, I retract what I said.
The second hand isn't a big deal.
Wow.
I flicked my wrist and it's there.
Who really cares?
Andrew always on the club series six large my friend well congratulations on
your on your series six Ness yeah thank you for congratulating my materialism I
feel better now so you bought an Apple watch this week and you bought Apple one
that's everyone I'm an apple one guy yeah I think you did as well Andrew no
no I I did the economic analysis and decided this is not yet for me oh my
Gosh, wow, I'm a you know, I'm a financial rationalist at heart and I looked at did the math and it didn't stack up
It was gonna cost me a little bit more than what I'm paying now. So I said well Apple you can just wait
I will get it. I will get it eventually but not so when when Ted lasso
2.0 comes out. That's when you're gonna get it. Yeah, let's see. They've extended my Apple TV plus
free period till February. So I'm not paying for that anyway, so why would I
voluntarily opt to pay for it now in a bundle?
I'm gonna get three months of Apple Fitness
for free because I bought their Series 6 watch. So I don't want to pay for that yet.
Get my three months trial on that. I have no interest in Apple News because in Australia
It's just a voice box for the Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch Empire, and I have no interest in reading their newspapers.
And what else is left? We've got, well, I'm paying for storage and I'm paying for music and don't really have a great interest in the arcade.
So, until I run out of free trials and the economic
mathematics changes, I'm gonna stick with what I've got.
I'm surprised your kids don't use arcade or is that a conscious choice that they just don't know it exists yet. I
Think it's more they don't know it exists
My youngest is probably a little bit too young
He's like just not quite five yet
my older boy who's nine and a half is all about roblox and
So Apple arcade just doesn't doesn't do it. It's like you don't it's not multiplayer. You don't
Play together. It's just it doesn't ever get mentioned in the the playground circles
Gotcha, because that seems like that would if especially with multiple kids like a five dollar a month thing to have like a bunch of games
That sounds like a gold mine, but if it's not the right stuff, yeah, it doesn't make sense
But that's a really good point about sorry to but in there
That's a really good point about what with with arcade and where the kids are really into it because I don't know that it's something
that I hear people in tech circles talking about all the time because, like we're speaking about
right now, it's part of Apple One, but how many kids are actually going in and speaking about
arcade games? You know, Fortnite and other things, that's all interconnected by this
online community or this feeling of competition. It's essentially social networking through a game,
but are there any games on arcade that are like that? I don't think so.
Yeah, Apple One. I will get it, but not yet. But you guys both have, right?
Yes, yeah, it saved me two cents a month, which I mean, obviously that was the reason to do it.
But it was it was just it was unlike your situation when I added up, I was already paying
$30 a month anyway. So now I'm paying $30 a month. I only get billed once, which I mean,
who cares, but I don't know, you know, it's one less thingy to pop up on the list. And I get
News Plus for free.
It, you know, you say it's not really free, but it's now part of what I was
paying already.
Um, which I had Apple or I had Apple News Plus back when it first came out.
$9.99 a month.
Definitely not the right number for me.
I, you know, I did not care $10 worth at all.
Um, but having, just having it kind of happen now is, is fine.
I did try this, the audio thing where it does the audio articles.
I'm I've mixed feelings on it.
I like it.
I think it's pretty cool feature.
I'm already so backlogged with, with, um, other stuff though, that it's just like,
it's almost become like, Oh, another, you know, bucket of stuff that I'm not
listening to.
Cool.
Uh, maybe that's not great, but it's a cool idea.
I think it's, it's interesting.
The magazine thing.
I mean, I've never been a magazine person, except like back when, you know, back in the
90s, when you get like Computer Shopper, and it was like that 4000 page Bible of like every
computer part in the world, and you just look through it for hours.
Well, I say, I did, I think most people probably did it.
But I was a loyal subscriber to Amiga format for many years, pick it up from the newsagent
every month.
I love that thing.
Do you have boxes full of them?
I did for many years, I do not anymore, and I still miss them.
I dearly wish I had like just one copy of it from like 1996 or something just to have,
but I'm sure I can find it online somewhere.
I may have kept the one where my letter to the help support team got published.
What did you ask?
Oh, goodness me.
It was something about building an alternative workbench boot disk or something like that,
I was trying to script it or something and I couldn't quite work out how to do it and the only way you could get help
Was to write a letter
Not an email a letter to England where the magazine was and then just and then wait six months
I know that you got published I
Think I
Think I'd solve the problem by the time I got my magazine printed
But it was very very exciting to see my name in print as a kid going. Yes
Yeah, as far as Apple one goes I am NOT a financial rationalist in that sense
I did think about whether I was saving something maybe for a slight moment, then I went it's easier
I like the one amount they got me there because I intend certainly to keep Apple TV plus as it stands I like the
focused nature of the service the entire disadvantage as it was pitched originally as
Apple doesn't have a back catalog
How lame is this? No, they're starting from scratch and it's actually digestible what they have on there whether you like it or not
So, you know, that's one me over at least for the moment news plus I certainly have mixed feelings on I think like you Jason
I
Think there's that element of focus if you do subscribe to certain channels or magazines that maybe you don't get in
Twitter feeds or if you're still on Facebook and you're just being bombarded by information
The thing that I do like about News+ is when certain publications, and just to be clear like you said Andrew, not
Murdoch Media, none of that is appearing in my app
Not subscribing to that. I like the Apple News format when it's wholeheartedly adopted by a publication
And they don't just upload the PDF style magazine
But they have that nice flowing menu of different articles and you go in there
And you look at something like the Vox highlight or Time magazine or something
And you've got this nice little stack in this edition of 10 different articles all nicely linked by their bold headings
Super nice to scroll through on the iPad, so I don't know if I'll use it as much as things like
RSS or just visiting websites, but it does feel nice when it's packaged that way like it's worth
Paying for something like the digital equivalent of a finely printed page as far as fitness plus goes
I'm not sure about what that's going to be like either
I have a feeling like every coach is going to be really obnoxious. I don't know what you two think but when I saw that
Fitness video promo in the keynote. I thought I really don't need someone
Enthusiastically yelling at me through a TV while I'm pushing and sweating on the you can do it. Yeah
I don't know if I can cope with that. I like what you said about Apple TV to the the intentionality of it
I really enjoy with Apple TV that I know
Unlike every other service where you go to it most of the time not knowing what the hell you're gonna
Watch or do there and then you end up just looking at crap forever
And then you never actually watch anything which is whatever that's called. There's gonna be a word for it, and it's super annoying
Apple TV plus it's like you're there because you already know you want to watch
XYZ like oh I want to watch Ted lasso here. I am boom
This is where I go to watch that and it's also not find it Jason if you can find it in their interface
Well, yeah, it's all well and good knowing you want what you want to watch then you're gonna find it
That's why you use the Siri button. Yeah, okay
I always forget that but that's no but that's it
No, but that's a great point about the interface and this is where I think there's a genuine concern
For what's currently good at the moment two or three years down the track because it's good at the moment when there are fewer shows
But if Apple doesn't change anything about that interface, you know
when you look at the Apple TV app and you've got that big banner and you swipe left and
right through the shows before you burrow down another level, if it's still going to
be like that in two or three years time with more and more shows and series, I'm sorry,
that's going to be completely untenable, unwieldy. Like I won't be able to cope with that. That's
just poor design. But on the topic of Ted Lasso, if you don't mind me bringing this
up just briefly now. I don't think Andrew ever minds if you bring up Ted Lasso. I could
Just stare into his beautiful eyes all day.
Look at that mustache and think,
what a wonderful man he is.
I wish he was real.
I want him to be real.
He's real in my heart.
I love Ted Lasso.
- That escalated very quickly.
But that's beautiful, Andrew.
That's beautiful.
Well, I'll bring Ted Lasso up then for you.
I just want to say,
'cause I started watching it certainly after you, Andrew,
maybe you as well, Jason,
when we were chatting about it on Discord.
When it started, I thought Ted Lasso is a character,
and for anyone who is listening who hasn't seen it,
we're talking about the show where an NFL coach
is brought over to England, all fictitious of course,
to coach English Premier League soccer team,
which he's never coached before.
Anyway, with the character, I instantly fell in love
with him and thought he was funny.
Very endearing, super positive, no arguments from me there.
The thing that disappointed me at first
was that I didn't think a single English character
the show was funny. It felt like I was expecting an English comedy with an American protagonist,
but what I got was an American comedy that happened to be set in Britain where only the
American was funny. Anyway, after two or three episodes I got into the swing of it and super
enjoyed it. And what I think is really interesting about this show, because lots of other podcasts
have spoken about Ted Lasso at length, but what I think is interesting is that it was
technically an Apple product in inverted commas which I wasn't sold on from the beginning. This
whole TV services angle is very different from the instantly sexy desirable hardware. I saw a show
when I'm not going to watch this, heard enough people talking about it and now I've been brought
into the fold. What do you two think about that? Do you see shows and think "oh I'm instantly into
that or how do you feel about it?
Two of the shows, yes.
The Ted Lasso one, the problem with the Ted Lasso show was the fact that it was always,
the way it's described is always immediately something about football.
And so I immediately tuned out every time.
It was like, "No, no, it's about football, but it's really good."
And I'm like, "Yeah, I just do not care about football at all."
So that was the biggest hurdle.
And I think that's probably the hurdle for most people is you say like, "Oh, it's about
football."
And they tune out and you go, "No, no, no, but he's going to go do soccer or, you know,
actual football."
And you're like, "Yet another thing I don't care about.
Okay, you've anti-sold me twice.
Great."
The Ted Lasso one was honestly probably the surprise of the year in terms of TV or movies
or anything for I think a lot of people.
seemed like the kind of thing where when Apple TV started, they had a handful of shows that
they are like, these are going to be the best shows anyone has ever seen.
And it's like, they were fine.
And then it was like, here's this weird, goofy football guy thing.
And then boom, just blew up out of nowhere to be the like the talk of the town.
So that's the show that I think no one knew they wanted, but it's the one that Apple TV
plus needed to really say we're here to actually be a thing that's not just
we're a big tech company playing in media now yeah I think some of those
early shows like see and morning the morning show morning wars whatever we
want to call it that they felt like they were trying too hard to be top-shelf
television you know we're here to win the Emmys is the Emmys whatever the TV
Awards are and I almost didn't know if they thought they were movies or TV
shows I felt like they were confused as to what they even were I think they
thought that they were making a movie that was in like six parts and it's like
pick one you're either a movie or you're a TV show you don't get to be both but I
felt like they were just confused as to who they were yeah as opposed to like
Ted Lassner I think it knew exactly what it was it knew it had a particular story
to tell it had a character to build that story around.
It didn't take itself too seriously, but it didn't like it,
but it was serious in a way like it touched on some,
some relevant issues and had character development and that kind of thing.
It was heartfelt, but it was,
it felt like it was made for an audience of TV watchers,
not an audience of TV critics.
Yeah. And if I can, if I can add to that,
I think the other thing that makes it so different is that ever since you've had shows like The Sopranos,
Breaking Bad, Lost, that transformation of TV into more of a movie universe,
we've gotten really used to anti-heroes, people who we learn to love and hate at the same time.
Whereas Ted Lasso as a character,
I don't think there's a single thing about him that is unlikable. And then even when he does something which is slightly out of character,
he immediately rectifies it or learns from his mistakes and opens up about
what he learned, that there's virtually nothing that you can dislike or criticize about him.
So it's more of a return of the hero in a show.
I immediately found myself ranking, you know, who's my favorite character in the show?
And after every episode, the ranking would shift a little bit until the very end.
I finally came up with my top five characters, which that's not usually a thing that would
happen in a show.
I'm not sitting there like actively like ranking people against each other and
rooting for certain people to do things.
It's much more passive.
So it was, it was, it was a weird feeling to kind of feel invested in this show,
which I'm not obviously, but, um, it had that kind of power.
So, so Jason, are you, I mean, you,
you strike me as a bit of a Jamie Tartt sort of character, you know,
you do you relate to him strongly?
I feel attacked right now.
No, no, no, no.
Like he's a superstar.
He's got the pretty girl.
And he is not anywhere on the list at all.
And I have six people on the list and he's not on it.
No, Chad Andrew.
I think you've hit a nerve here.
Couldn't stand him.
Now I have to give you the list because if I don't, you know,
I want the list.
I want to be curious.
Top five characters.
Ted Lasso season one.
Number one, Roy Kent.
I found him to be the most relatable personally.
- The captain for people at home who haven't watched.
- Yeah, he's the older guy on the team.
He's been the big star already.
He's still good, but he's just,
he's maybe past his prime a little bit.
Kind of annoyed at everything, swears a lot.
So I very much relate to him.
Number two, Ted Lasso, obviously.
Three, Keeley Jones.
I thought she was a really good character in that show.
It was at the very beginning, you were kind of like,
I don't know, but then it just, she grew on you.
Four, Rebecca Welton, who was the owner.
Five, Nate the Great.
Amazing character, loved him.
And then bonus number six, Coach Beard.
You know, Jason, that's a good list and I appreciate you.
Thank you. Thank you.
There's a lot of thought in that.
Trust me. That list was flying all over the place throughout the seasons, but
yeah. So there's your, there's your Ted Lasso corner.
And now we have season two coming and season three is,
I don't understand how TV works because season three is already like, yeah,
go make season three, but season two hasn't even started yet, but.
I don't care. I'm ready to green light season four. Let's make it happen.
I was gonna say we've got this reverse sponsors situation here.
Yes spending money differently now I really should I probably shouldn't talk to this cuz this just this disturbs me to the core being the CFO of our little hemispheric views organization the idea of.
Giving money rather than earning money I'm thinking we've got the business model slightly wrong here so I'm concerned I'm gonna put that out on the table.
Okay, I don't quite know what the plan is here. It seems like it might be another one of Jason's wacky ideas
It is it up. It absolutely is. Yeah, maybe if you could brief briefers
Run through what you what you're proposing anything I could do to make the CFO uncomfortable is kind of where I like to be
That's what in bullets. Yeah, you should be so normally the way
Businesses work, which obviously this is a major enterprise
You do a thing people give you money for the thing. It's kind of how it works, right?
I mean, you know, I don't it's I'm no spreadsheet guy, but I think that's how it works
Like everything except social media works that way right exactly which is not real life. So we'll just kind of put that aside for now
Yeah
So what I've decided we should do is instead of having
Sponsors on the show that give us money to talk about their stuff
What we're gonna do is take the money we already have and give it away to like charities instead.
So we're gonna reverse sponsor charities every episode out of our own pocket instead of getting
money the other way.
So at the end of the day, we start an episode with X dollars and then we end the episode
having less than that.
Does that sound like a good business model?
Look, I'm all for social enterprise and corporate social responsibility. I've got no issue with that whatsoever.
Perfect. But it should be exercised through a properly budgeted corporate strategy that's outlined in a lengthy document, is that correct?
Oh, absolutely, yes, and it should be in alignment with our values.
And it better be a Word document that is not "docx" but just ".doc".
Yes, and it wouldn't...
In Arial, preferably.
And it would be sponsorshipopportunities/corporatesocialresponsibility-proposalv3.2finalv2.doc.
So my reverse sponsor for this week is...
I couldn't decide.
It's so hard.
There's so many things that...
You know, you can't do everything.
So my approach this week was to do Kiva.
Have you guys heard of this?
It's like a...
What is it?
It's almost like a crowdfunding sort of thing for charities, maybe?
I'm not really describing that very well.
But the way it works is you basically go through their site and they have a bunch of different
people from different countries that need money for various things to, to,
you know, add commerce to their village, or we need to, you know,
build a well or something.
So I went on there and I just kind of went through and picked, uh, let's see,
one, four, eight, I couldn't really decide.
So I picked 16 different people, just gave them all money for a thing they needed.
So I think I'm, I think Kiva, I think even my mother has used Kiva.
To donate money, but if I'm not mistaken, it's actually like a equity play isn't it?
Don't they return your investment after they've done what they do? Yeah, so you give them? Yeah, that's thank you
It's it's more of a loan a micro loan. There you go. That's what it is
So I micro loaned 16 people
Crap laughing. I'm sorry. Thank you for all the things that they needed. Is this coming directly out of the hemisphere of use budget?
No this is just coming out of my budget this is my this is my budget that the CFO allotted me.
I think you exceeded your authority to spend.
I use the corporate card so I think it's okay.
I gave him a corporate card.
Oh, we're ruined.
[laughter]
This KV investment better pay off, Jason.
Uh, I don't know. It probably, I don't know, maybe.
Everybody seems to be repaying on time.
I mean, I just did this, so that doesn't say a lot, but
I'm pretty excited about it, because, you know, Ruben
gets to start his photography business in Kenya.
I like that.
Uh, what else do we have here?
We have Emily who's farming in Kenya as well.
Don't tell me you funded somebody in Nigeria.
Just a prince. He said that he needed to have all of his money given to someone
and then I would give it back but I got to keep like half of it for doing him a favor.
Okay, well that sounds like a good deal.
It seemed like a good idea, you know. I mean half is, that's a lot.
Anyway, in all seriousness, yeah, Kiva, I gave a bunch of money to people on Kiva.
It seems like a pretty cool thing.
They have teams or something.
It seems like it always makes sense to do donations when you can do maybe more in one
direction than just a bunch of little bits all over the place.
So I don't know, maybe I'll start like a team or something and people can jump on and we
can have some kind of goal or something.
But anyway, reverse sponsors give other people money that need it more than you do.
I was really happy that you popped this in our little board there, Jason, because you
reminded me of a donation that I meant to make a little while ago and totally forgot
to do.
And it was after I watched this.
I cannot speak to how fantastic this documentary is.
I keep littering media corner throughout parts of the episode, so I apologize for that.
But it's a documentary called In My Blood It Runs, and it follows the story of this
young Aboriginal boy in Australia who, how do I explain?
He's caught between the worlds of Aboriginal Australian education and the more Western
style English speaking education system, flourishing in one, struggling in the other.
And I can't recommend this enough.
I was motivated to write a review about it on my blog.
And attached to that they have this donation page as part of an organization called Children's
Ground, an organization for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and they're
raising money to build Aboriginal-specific schools in Australia that match their culture
and preference for education and communication.
And it's just the most beautiful film.
So I completely forgot to give money to it because I was so, like, emotionally moved
by this piece. So yeah, happy to sling some money that way if it's okay with you CFO.
It's fine. I think that's a wonderful cause. Now I've been caught on the hop because I
didn't quite understand what this reverse sponsorship deal was all about. So I haven't
done any research into who I can give money to. But I'm happy to give some money to somebody
or some organisation, I should say, that deserves it. So perhaps I can be either, I can either
I might look at Kiva. I might look at the one you talked about Martin or I'm I don't know what what should I do?
I'm open to suggestions
Well, they'll be in the show notes. Yeah, but I promise I'll do something
Talking about where we spend our money
We were talking about news a bit before but I think something a little bit more on brand for us is stuff like RSS
We are doing a podcast after all. What's the service situation for you to where do you do?
you put your money into anything like RSS services or syncing apps or anything
like that?
I just changed all of that actually,
which is interesting that you brought that up because I used to pay for
feed bid, which is great. I have no issues with it.
The hamburger one, right?
Yeah, the hamburger one,
which is actually why I picked it to begin with way back when,
it's because of that hamburger icon. So, uh, you know,
the branding worked. Um, but yeah,
I just got rid of it because I didn't really need it.
Um, reader five came out recently and had iCloud syncing.
Cause I was using news Explorer because it had iCloud syncing, but.
That needs a little bit of work.
Um, so I tried reader five cause it had iCloud syncing and it's perfect.
It does exactly what I need.
Like I don't, I used to have like a bunch of fancy rules and stuff that would like
block certain articles or like filter that, who cares?
I, I could just go past it if I don't care.
But yeah, reader five with the iCloud sync works great.
Um, they have this thing called, uh, don't fetch.
So like I have my, my, my main Mac on my desk is just, it's on 24, seven.
It's, you know, it's basically a server.
So I have that fetching new articles.
like constantly and refreshing.
And then every other device, iPhones, iPads, other computers, whatever
you can turn on don't fetch.
So instead of each of those devices going out and checking the whole
RSS feed thing every single time, it just looks at your main computer
and says, Hey, what's the iCloud status of all of our stuff and just sinks that.
So it's super fast.
So if you've just finished reading everything on your main Mac and you
pick up your phone, the phone says, Hey, iCloud, what do you got?
Nothing.
Great.
Done.
Instead of going, checking all the feeds, they all show up and then they all
disappear because they're all red already.
Doesn't do any of that.
So that's been really cool, unexpected feature.
And then it has, um, also, uh, a read it later component, which I'm so
sick of read it later at this point.
I, I just, I'm losing my, my, I'm losing my mind in regards to read it later
because I hate them all. They're all stupid. I never use any of them. I just have buckets
of crap everywhere that I never read, and I don't know why I even bother. But what did
I do? Moved all my stuff from the other Read It Later into Reader 5, and guess what? It's
sitting there now, not getting read. So yeah, Read It Later's great. Such a fantastic service
for me personally. I bet it works great for some people, but I absolutely suck at Read
It's funny you mentioned read at later services.
My I've actually just had a re-engagement with that whole process.
I went off them years ago but have recently resubscribed to Instapaper and have developed
an entirely new kind of workflow to try and get more value from all the garbage I read
on the web all the time that just seems to go in my head.
of it cogitates around for a while but most of it just sort of falls out the other side.
So I'm trying to integrate my RSS service which I use iKnowReader, not because, I mean
I've used RSS, I digress, I've used RSS from the days of blog lines which predated Google
Reader. Went through the whole Google Reader thing and then into Feed Wrangler, which is
the David Smith service for a year, and then went to iKnowReader. And somehow I've ended
up with, I think I got some like credits for iKnowReader somehow, I had some deal and I
got it really cheap, so now I have it for the next three years, so I'm kind of locked
in because I paid not much money to get it for a long period of time. So I'm using that
with Reader. Yes, I'm a RSS addict from way back. But what I was finding, I'm reading
all this stuff all the time, but now what I'm trying to do is put the stuff I really
value, like the high value stuff, I'll send it to Instapaper and now I'm trying to use their
markup service, you know, that you can kind of highlight in Instapaper and then I'm putting
those highlights get sucked into Readwise, which is that readwise.io to resurface them
from time to time.
And then also those highlights I'm sending them into my Devonthink archive as a bunch
of notes and that kind of thing to try and maintain, Jason doesn't like Devonthink, try
to maintain a corpus of stuff that I've read and can research and look back on and that
kind of thing.
a whole new RSS read later thing going on at the moment. Early days, we'll see if it
sticks. Oh and the one other thing that then happens is then all of that stuff also goes
into a Notion database. And so I've got the Notion as well. You've gone like full nerd.
This is the problem, whenever I find something new I go too deep on it and I just dive into
And I'm like and then it'll be six months and I'll have forgotten all that stuff and I'll moved on to something new
Yeah, well, I mean my RSS story if I can just get into that for a second is much simpler
It's feed bin in net news wire
And the reason that I use net news wire was because I was completely sucked in to the entire and I don't know if this was
intentional it could have been a master marketing stroke by
creator Brent Simmons, but the whole narrative of this return to the Mac and the open source story
and the relentlessly obsessive minimalist super slick Mac development and the way that it just
takes in all those sort of UI conventions and everything, I was like "yep, I love it. I just
want to have that beautiful simple experience." And I open it and even if it's just tapping into
that cult area of my Apple brain. Don't care. Love it. It's the smooth scrolling. It's the
blog pieces about we've been crafting. Almost like I read it in Johnny Ives voice. We've spent the
last 10 years in a white room looking for this one bug that could maybe ruin the resizing of
the window. And now we fixed it for you. And I'm like, I feel happy about this.
Don't worry, Mark. I'm jealous that you get to use that app. I've been following its development
for so long and they keep saying, "Oh, and we're adding sync." And then they add feedly sync.
Like, come on. I'm sitting here with my iKnowReader account going, "When can I use it?"
So I will switch away from Reader 4 as soon as I can.
It's lovely. I think it's great. And look, maybe there are elements of the iPad version that maybe
you don't like as much as Reader or whatever you two want to use. But on the Mac, I look at it and
I go, "Oh, it feels like home. It feels like what a native Mac app should be."
Yeah, it's a great app on the Mac for sure. I mean, I have it, but I used to use it as well
when I had Feedbin. I agree. The iOS one, I never, I don't know, for some reason I couldn't get into
the iOS version, but the Mac one is like absolutely wonderful. It's a glass of ice
water in an electron desert. Absolutely. Gross. Good way to put it. For Media Corner today,
I have to bring up something that I did discuss separately with Andrew online, but I feel that
it's too good and too Australian not to include and it's multi layered. I do enjoy a multi layered
transmedia experience as the academics like to put it. We have a TV show that refers to
advertising that refers to jingles, right. So in Australia, for the uninitiated, we have a
television show called gruen, formerly known as the gruen transfer, which refers to the feeling
that you have when you're disorientated inside a shopping center where they've made it deliberately
difficult to navigate the layout and it's noisy and you retreat into shops. So this
show is all about advertising the effects of marketing and consumerism. Recently, on
one of their episodes on ABC TV in Australia, they covered Bunnings Warehouse, which in
Australia is a total behemoth in hardware and DIY products. Huge, right? But somehow
they managed to hold on to this really matesy feeling. They're doing community barbecues,
you go there with the kids, you just wander around in your paint-covered clothes, all that stuff.
They've had the same jingle for years and years and years. No one knew who the guy or woman was
who composed it. Finally they tracked him down, I think it was 25 years later, his name's Trevor
Hilton, and they got him to perform the video of this jingle, super funky on a keyboard, and
I just want to recommend to people out there if you can watch Gruen on ABC iview online,
give it a go. If you can watch a Bunnings ad just to see what Australians think is
decent advertising with a bunch of people in aprons telling you to buy a hammer,
you should watch that. And if you like funky jingles by someone who's kind of proud that he's
made this massively culturally influential song but sort of hates it as well, that's great. And
I'm going to provide all the links so you can check it out. Multi-layered, as I said, on Media
corner. I like nothing more than people in aprons trying to sell me hammers so
I'm already sold. Okay I guess I will I will go now. I had a little bit of an
issue this week with Media Corner because I was listening to Apple Music
something or other and this song came on and I absolutely I immediately loved it
I thought it was a great song really into it and thought well clearly
The whole album is gonna be great so I can use this for media corner the rest of the album
I did not like at all
So there was one song on this whole thing and I'm like, is that really count for media corner?
So I'm gonna say what the song is
Just so everyone knows what it is
And then I'm gonna cheat and add a second thing because I feel like one song is just not really good enough
So the song is called on the ropes by mint Royale. I guess is how you say that
It's track two
Oh, sorry. No, the song is called don't falter. The album is on the ropes. So now that you're fully confused, I'll say it again
The band is mint Royale album on the ropes. Just listen to track two. Don't falter full stop
Yeah, really weird. Usually there's at least a couple other things on an album, but I just I could not get into
Anything else so my cheat pick is going to be a game this time and we talked about Apple Arcade
This is on Apple Arcade, but it's other places as well, and it's called the last campfire
People probably have heard of this. It's not super new. I played through it. It's pretty short
It's like maybe four hours or something like that, but it's just a cool
Chill like laid-back kind of game. There's not you know, you're not shooting people. You're not running around stressed out
It's just kind of a it's a story driven a little bit of puzzle stuff thrown in for fun
Very emotional story. So yeah, I would recommend
Checking it out. If you have Apple Arcade you already have it if you don't it's it's not like a you know
It's not some $60
Triple-a title or something like that. So yeah, I would check it out. It's called the last campfire
That sounds interesting. I'll check it out in three months time when I buy Apple Premiere
I
Have got I do have a media corner. I'm actually gonna promote a competitor of ours
Somebody else in the podcast. It sounds like something I would do somebody this
Somebody that's doing it a lot more successfully than us
They're making lots of money out of it including from me because I pay them a patreon subscription mouth month by month
They don't need it because they're super successful, but they deserve it because it's excellent
It is the unmade podcast and it features
Um, Brady Haran who's famous in probably our sort of circles for working with CGP gray in the podcast world
I'm profile with hello internet
Yeah number file. Hello internet all that sort of stuff. He's got it. So this unmade podcast. He does it with a his
friend from when he was a kid living in Adelaide Tim Hein
The Reverend Tim Hein who lives in Adelaide, Australia. They have an excellent podcast. It's so good
So good that I pay for it. They have been on a
there's a long-running bit they do where they talk about a
1980s furniture shop in Adelaide that was called the sofa shop and
They have
Sort of beatified the theme song from the sofa shop that doesn't exist anymore. It's out of business
But they have just they used they talked about it and the sofa shop has become a big part of their podcast
To the point where they have crowd sourced a whole bunch of really well done
alternative remixes of the jingle people with musical talent have remade this part this this song
Just recently though. They actually managed to interview find an interview the original
Producers and singer of the jingle the sofa shop jingle from the 80s. It is
fantastic and these guys are really
Suspicious. Why would somebody be wanting to talk about a jingle from the 80s and
then
They said they had to have a sit down have a chat to them and then these guys get played back these really professional
covers of their jingle and
It's you could see that you could hear you don't see them. You could hear them just
Thinking wow this is not a joke this is a real thing in a different universe that I don't know anything about and I just
Everything about it is wonderful, and that's that podcast is wonderful the characters are wonderful the surfer shop jingle is wonderful
So yeah, that's it the unmade podcast give it a listen you don't have to subscribe to the patreon in fact don't
Give us that give us coffee money instead yes, so we can donate to someone else
Yeah, exactly to be clear that that patreon does not count as a reverse sponsorship
Try to leave that in there
Stopping now
