[Music]
Hello and welcome to episode 31 of Hemispheric Views.
Now you're probably wondering, where did Andrew and Jason go?
Why is only Martin speaking to us?
Well, the answer is simple. I got rid of them, and now the show is exactly the way that it
always should have been. Just me.
I'm only kidding. Never fear, both Andrew and Jason are alive and well, and they're
still co-hosts on this show. We wouldn't have it any other way.
The actual reason is that I'm here to mark the end of Arcadia June, our month-long gaming
competition. Thank you to everyone who got involved and sent screenshots of their high
scores in the public Discord. It was a lot of fun.
We also thought that we'd get in touch with Raffaele, the developer of Arcadia, who lives
in Italy, to see if he'd like to join us for an interview about the development of his
app.
Instead, his girlfriend Irene volunteered, and I do apologise if I'm butchering the
Italian pronunciation of their names.
What you're about to hear is a pre-recorded interview with Irene, where she discusses
some of the creative process and the ideas that went into choosing and developing the
vintage games that you've all come to know and love in Arcadia.
We thank her for her involvement in this podcast episode and hope that you enjoy the interview
as well.
Let's cross to it now.
He is the developer.
I actually had the idea for part of the games and Arcadia actually exists because I insisted
on this app to be on the store.
He had another project which didn't take off.
And this was a side project which we made with parts
of the precedent with the app he made before this one.
But Arcadia had a decent success on the market,
especially on the American market and the Australian market. This is where it
was downloaded the most. And we should make it clear as well that we didn't
know you or Raphael, either of you, before Arcadia June started. So this wasn't a
pre-meditated approach. We started a competition and then I think I actually
wrote a review on the Arcadia site saying it's good fun and and then you found
our podcast and it went from there which is wonderful couldn't think of a better
way of connecting people so what was it like to discover that suddenly this
podcast had put your game up in lights? It was really beautiful because we are
just a couple. We are an indie developer and me, I'm a secretary in an office,
I don't develop anything, but it's like a kid. Arcadia is something you have to
grow up to feed and every little light we have, we really like
to meet people who liked this app.
And this is why we go to talk with everyone who has an idea, has something fun to do with
us and with this app.
I don't know how to better explain it.
It's just beautiful.
I think the metaphor of a child is really good.
What does that timeline look like for you both?
From was this a year ago you started?
Was this a few months?
What did the timeline look like and did you always think there would be this many games
or did you start with a handful and then more and more just kind of kept being added to
the mix?
We started with a handful of games which were taken from the previous app which contained
some mini games like Claw Machine was in the app we did before which was about pirates
and ships and something like that.
There are many games we added from there.
A Treasure Map 2 was a game from that app.
The timeline, well, I think it was December 19, 2019.
Actually on our anniversary, yes.
17 December 2019, which is the day
when Apple actually approved it.
And developing it was a little longer that we took
because this was a plan, a B plan.
He developed it in around seven months or so.
With a handful of games, when it started,
it was with six or eight games,
and then we added one, almost one every month,
and it's for free.
The price started a little lower
because there were so few games,
But it's a set now, that's the price and the games we develop.
I think of the games and he develops the games.
We are thinking about Arcadia on Apple TV
and actually is almost ready.
And we have a link if you want to join us on the beta.
- Already tried it, very happy so far.
- Just wanted to confirm, that means that Arcadia exists
on every single platform that Apple produce.
So it's a full suite product, isn't it?
And you purchase it and you get it,
not yet on Apple TV, but you will get it on Apple TV.
- It will be separated because,
yes, because we thought about
further developing on this app.
Maybe in the future,
you play with the second player on Apple TV.
- Nice.
- Maybe.
I'm happy to confirm that I also tried it as an iOS app on the Mac and I was very pleased.
It works really well there.
So I really have to compliment both of you on how you've come up with these ideas and
made them so playable on all different devices.
Because the thing that stands out is that from the watch all the way through to the
TV, I haven't really seen a game or set of games that translates so well across all different
sizes to play it with the crown through to you know a trackpad or a game
controller or something is amazing so you've said that you're the ideas person
for the games and he really develops them all of these games are very
nostalgic they have that vintage feel can you talk about what inspired you to
come up with these games or where these ideas come from? Yes please because I
Sorry, right before you go, I have to say this is the most nostalgia... being from
the United States, this is like United States 1980s walk into an arcade. It just
feels so perfect and you just you nailed it and I was curious just to add on to
Martin's question, is this what arcades were like / are like where you guys both
live in and is that kind of where your ideas came from or did you did this come
up from just seeing this somewhere else?
>> I love to play games.
And I started when I was younger.
And I started with Solitaire on Windows.
>> Oh, yeah.
Yes.
>> When you had to write in prompt to go to play,
and I was about five years old, six years old.
And from there, it took off, because I always played something.
Even when being a girl who plays games, it's not that easy.
Because in my house, my brother had every console he liked.
But when I asked for my first PlayStation, they told me,
don't you like something to dress up better?
Isn't it better?
I want to play.
And so I always had this passion.
I've been to many arcade places and I always played on... I don't know the word in English,
just a moment. I'm very curious. I know, I'd say.
I'm just curious. Cabinato, uh,
cabin, arcade, cabin. Oh, cabinet!
Coin operated. Yep.
Coin operated. Yes. And I always plays with those. Actually, my stepfather is nostalgic
and he has a lot of those.
Oh, like a collection. He has them.
Oh, nice.
The cabinets.
That's awesome.
Yes, I think four, five from every decade.
Wow.
Wow.
Cool.
So this was a big influence on your enjoyment,
on your passion for the games.
A lot.
We take some ideas from there.
So was Raphael much of a games person
or he was just an app developer
and you came along and said,
"Rafael, I have to tell you, it's gonna be games and that's it."
No, he's a games person. He enjoys playing games. There's no doubt about it. We always play together.
Earlier Martin was talking about how it scales and I just I don't want that to even get lost
a little bit in the sense that not only is a game is that impressive, I would say in terms of every
app that I've ever used on the platform, which at this point is basically every single one,
If I were going to do a keynote as Apple right now, I would actually use this as an example
of what is always being preached about the power of the platform being able to scale
from an Apple Watch to an Apple TV.
That is always the messaging and the branding that is there, but all too often that never
actually happens.
may get... generally it plays out like this. There's an iPhone app and then maybe you
sort of get that app in other places but it doesn't really mesh super well. But
the fact that when when Natasha first told us about this game and she said she
was playing it on her watch and I was like okay first of all games on a watch
that's seems insane but okay but to actually play you know pick any one of
games on the watch to the phone to the iPad to the Apple TV it just scales
beautifully from one to the next it's the perfect example to me of what the
platform has always promised but yet we haven't really seen that take place so I
just I have to commend you both on that for really digging in and utilizing the
platform for what its true intention is.
I think these, uh, is all for a file.
He is the one that sticks to that pixel and says, these must go
and changes everything because of one pixel.
He's really precise.
Uh, sometimes he delays, uh, uh, from public, from being
publicated because he has to have that one in that place in every single screen.
I don't want to get too personal but is he like this with arranging things at
home? Does he have a very clean shelf? No. That sounds about right. Only on displays.
I'm always trampling on his shoes which are everywhere, like mine, okay, but he does the same.
And so does that mean that every single element of this game has been developed by the two
of you?
Nothing has been outsourced to graphic designers or anything like that?
You've done every little bit of code is your own.
I mean, I'm not a coder, so it amazes me.
He did everything from graphic to coding.
Just songs are outsourced because we don't compose.
Wow, that's truly incredible.
This is like the indie developer showcase kind of story that I think a lot of people
really enjoy.
Yeah, I just back on that nostalgia as well.
I just need to have you understand me as a user or a player of the games.
The first time I looked is Fast Run, I think, which is the little, the car one, the three
lanes of traffic.
The fact that it's called Fast Run, obviously is an homage to Out Run.
Now Outrun, when I was a kid, was one of my favorite games.
And having that, I always remember driving and having the blonde girl, you know, with
the hair flowing until you wrecked the car.
It was just, just this wave of nostalgia just came over me.
Like I've never, I've seen other car racing games over the years, but that one, for some
reason it just brought back all the Outrun memories for me, just absolutely.
I think I used to play on my Commodore 64 or something like that,
as well as the coin ops and things.
So, yeah, thank you.
I just want to say, like, just amazing.
I have the same nostalgia with the breakout,
Arkanoid, Space Invaders.
Those are the game that I played the most.
Something is missing, but maybe.
That's great.
Yeah, I think the other thing you've nailed also is the interaction
time with each game where if you were in a in an arcade physically you might be
there for hours playing a given game but because it's on all these various
devices you're able to just jump in play any one of them quickly in a couple of
minutes and jump out and it but it doesn't feel cheap like a lot of the you
know, give us, you know, buy gems and play some garbage game for five minutes.
It's just a nice hit of let me jump in, try to get a high score, and then get
back out. But it's just, it's got a great balance in that respect, I think. That's
what we thought when we decided about this app. This app has to be something to
play on your wrist, on your Apple Watch. So it has to be fast
because you watch your, you look at your watch, you play, you have two minutes, you're
waiting for your bus, you're in line and then you go do your things and come back
and play again. I don't know, many of our users are I think about our age,
ranging from 30 years old to 45 or 50 years old, and some are even older, I think.
We had someone who said, "When I was a kid and now I am 70 years old and I'm playing again the same games."
I think that the most of our users are parents now that want their kids to try their games when they were young.
And it's something really beautiful to see, really funny, because our parents did the same with us.
they say we played with this, try this thing.
It's the same, just in modern times.
- Yep, yeah, it just shifts generations.
Me personally, I'm holding onto all the retro PS1s, N64s,
NESs so that when I have children, they can play those
and then look at me like I'm insane
that I would ever play something that is so primitive
in their eyes compared to whatever
they're gonna be playing, I'm sure.
Yeah, how do they look on your HD or 4k television, Jason?
Probably not as good as Arcadia will.
Exactly.
Arcadia looks brilliant on a 4k TV.
Everything old is new again.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yep.
This was your first app, correct?
You said that you, you were all, we're working on something else, but then this
kind of became the primary thing you were working on, or is this a, an app in a line
of other things that you all have worked on?
This is the last app he did.
He actually did Breakout as a standalone game, as one of his first games.
And with that, he had Uhoh, another game, and Breakout, and another one which I can't
remember right now, who had a lot of success because it was the first game on
Apple Watch, the first ever, and it was on the store on the front page and the
first success was that. Nice. So is he a developer by trade? Is this his
day-to-day work that he does or is this just purely a side passion that he and you are
both doing?
>> STACIA It's his job.
He learned by himself when he was younger.
And he developed many apps after that.
He also works with another society which makes 3D designs and he developed an app for a museum.
Actually two apps for a museum.
One was Ontario, a museum in Ontario for a picture and the other one is a museum in Berlin,
in Berlin, the most recent one.
Toronto.
Toronto.
It was the first one in Toronto and the second one in Berlin.
So he's always developed something.
He just likes it.
It's very impressive being self-taught as well.
That's quite incredible.
So what do the two of you make of the scores being achieved by our little group of players
in Arcadia for Arcadia June?
Are they reasonable scores?
Are you surprised?
Should they be ashamed?
No, no.
No, no. We have some real nerds, because, for example, in Fast Run,
Raffaele thought that the highest score you could achieve was,
date number, I think, around 68,000.
And then it came the first one.
He calculated it.
You can do this, no more than this.
And someone arrives with 69,000 or 70,000 and just how is it possible?
We don't know how they can do these high scores.
And it's not cheating because we check it for it.
The beauty of software and having users, they will always break your stuff somehow.
Yes, really.
Martin, I think you can probably speak best to the ability to break this particular game
given that your wife is somewhat of a passionate player.
You're absolutely right. I have to say, I don't know if you
saw from previous episodes, Irene, or listened to anything, but
seriously, I came across this app. I thought it was very impressive. I saw that it was in,
I think it's even in the App Store section on the watch, like the starter kit, or apps you should try.
Because obviously it is that good, and that's why we're talking about it today.
And I suggested it to Natasha, and I always knew that my wife Natasha was into things like,
You know, Snake on the old Nokia phones and things like that
But she has just gone and run with it
And I don't think she really plays anything more than this
I haven't seen her play Snake, her all-time favourite game, for a long time
This is what she plays now
So, yeah, I...
Is she at the top of most of the leaderboard things? I haven't checked for a while
She's up there and then Eric just came in recently with a bunch of new scores as well
I'm blown away with the amount of...
I mean, I half-jokingly said Arcadia June just because this game came up in the show sporadically.
I was like, "Wow, this is really good."
To half-jokingly said Arcadia June and holy hell, if we haven't just had a barrage of screenshots coming at it,
I don't regret it, but it was like I just gave myself a new job of collecting scores and creating a leaderboard
because everybody's just been going nuts with it.
I think it really hits that special place for a lot of people to see something like
this.
Eric said he went camping and I think he basically went camping with a tent and that game and
he came back with a suit.
I don't think he must have done anything else on that camping trip except play Arcadia because
he certainly had a lot of higher scores.
I think he may have a problem.
Oh yeah, and Eric, we're happy to support you in any way you need in the public Discord.
For sure.
And look, I mean, by the time this is out, Arcadia June will have been finished.
This one should be out Thursday, which I think is what, beginning of July?
So we'll have wrapped up by then.
We will know the winners.
It'll be all over the press, all over the news, I'm sure.
Irene, did you have something that you'd like to say to the listeners who've come on board
to play Arcadia with us?
There's a thing I'd like to say.
Arcadia has two big milestones that we are proud of.
One, the first is that it appeared on Vuvudc.
Behind the people talking, there was Arcadia.
And the second one is that Arcadia has been pre-installed on, I think, every Apple Watch
in the stores.
Oh, wow.
If you ever come across Arcadia in a store, you can take a picture and we really, really
like to gift you something, just because we want to see Arcadia all over the world and
have this memory.
And we have, obviously, for you, many codes for the new Arcadia on Apple TV, if you like
it.
want to try something else from Rafael, he has other games you can try on your iPhone
and your watch.
For someone who's approaching Arcadia for the first time, I say just go with it because
it's memory, you don't have to learn anything new, just go with it, play and it will be
fun.
Just time, the time passes by.
One last question for me before we let you go.
Between the two of you, or for both of you, what is your personal favorite games in Arcadia?
I think his favorite one, I think it's Fast Run, while mine is Space Invader.
Ah, gotcha.
Classic.
Very nice.
That was going to be my last question, is who's better, Irene?
Of the two of you, who's the better player in general?
For those listening, you can probably guess she put her hand up.
We believe you, it's all right.
Okay.
I'm the nerd one.
Oh, you're the nerd one.
I think on behalf of the three of us, I mean, Jason, Andrew, or Piper, I just wanted to
say a big thank you for taking the time to talk to us and join us on the show.
It means a lot to have a developer come in and you as well, obviously, as a team, come
into our public Discord, speak with our listeners, get to know people, see them as they share
their scores.
to us as makers of this podcast.
Agreed, guys?
Absolutely.
I mean, just meeting people from around the world outside of where we would normally see
and meet other people, you know, developer or not.
It's just been, it's been so nice to speak with you today.
We really appreciate you coming on and chatting with us and just kind of becoming part of
the, you know, hemispheric family.
So thank you so much.
Grazie.
Ooh.
Grazie a te.
Bonus points.
Don't push me further.
That's a bonus.
Don't push me further, that's the limit.
It was really a pleasure for me being here today.
It's been fun talking.
It's the first time I talk with someone from outside Italy about the app developed by Raffaele.
It's been funny.
It's strange.
It's new.
It's something I never did and I don't know if something like this will ever happen again
to us.
So thank you.
Everybody needs to go out to the App Store and give Arcadia 5 stars and a review, because
reviews are very important, and tell everybody they know to buy a copy, because money is
the most viable review possible.
So purchase copies everybody.
Thank you.
Money is important, but feeling good about something you did is the best thing you can
have.
(upbeat music)
Patreon, Patreon, Patreon, Patreon update,

Where does one go if one wanted to sign up at what website might they do that at I would go to one prime plus
Dot-com that's one prime plus dot-com part of the hemispheric views Network
We have a listener question from someone called Vincent. I think we know who he is. I think he's a listener. Yeah, Vincent.
I'm not familiar with his work.
Okay, well, look, we'll move on. Whoever this guy is.
I'm familiar with his desk.
Oh, his desk. Yes, his desk.
Remember he had that ejector button.
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. Okay. Yep. Got it. Now I've placed it in my mind's eye.
All right. So Vincent with the ejector button on his desk has sent in a question about
sleeping with
Personal questions. I don't know if we're really prepared to go there. But geez just right into the
Sleeping. Okay. So the question is do any of us sleep with our eye devices?
I'm assuming that he doesn't mean in the bed or the platform upon which we sleep. It's about charging, right?
But I think this is a very controversial topic for a lot of people.
And I'm assuming what he means is where are your devices when you go to sleep versus do
you sleep with them?
In other words, are they sitting next to the bed?
Are they in a different room?
For me personally, that means two things.
Apple Watch as well as iPhone.
iPads and all the rest, nowhere near your room, I don't think generally.
For me, the watch, I've always wanted to be a sleep watch person, but it just never works
out.
Every time I try it, there's this whole song and dance of, "Now I've got to coordinate
multiple charge times for when I wake up, and oh, I've got to put it on there, then
get in the shower, then I can put the watch back on to make sure I get a stand minute,
and then I've got to take it back off to do the rest of my morning."
No.
You know what?
I probably slept.
I didn't knowing what it was isn't really gonna help me with anything. So
the one tracking metric that I just kind of don't get, you can track your sleep
and then I guess you could sort of maybe correlate that to other activities and
try to change the other activities to affect your sleep but it's like if I
wake up and it says hey you slept like crap it's like yeah okay like I can't do
anything about that. It's not really actionable information I guess for me so
I've always wanted to be a sleep tracker person but it's just such a pain I don't
bother. So I don't wear a watch to bed. I built a little nightstand with an
integrated MagSafe charger for my phone and an Apple Watch charger little stand
thing and I just put them both on there when I go to sleep. Everything is as
silent as it can possibly be and that's that. I go to bed put them on there, wake
up, take them off, pretty simple. Nothing too crazy. I'm not a... I don't use them in
the night or anything, but if for some reason something comes up, I want to know
where that device is. If there were an emergency or something, I want to know. I
just reach one foot to the left or whatever and grab my phone to call
someone or to if someone's calling me an emergency or something, I had to answer
it there's no question as to where it's going to be so that's why I prefer to
have it close by as a safety type thing but yeah yeah I'm very similar I have
both devices next to me and my I'm quite chuffed with this I have to say I'm
using the exact same Belkin charging dock on my current iPhone 12 mini as
what I bought to go with my iPhone 5 and I have used it with every single phone
That I've had since or in between so I used to plonk like an iPhone 7 plus on that and worry that it was going to
Tip or snap or break never did such a thing happen
confirmed planned obsolescence
Oh wait, it's worked for that. Oh shoot. Sorry. It's the other way. It actually works for friggin ever got it
Yeah, it worked forever. So there's that plus I have the little watch charging dock in the shape of this
Classic Mac, which is great, but I'm the same as you Jason. I kind of thought oh, you know
should I put things in another room, should I keep it here? Of course the iPad
and stuff is separate but those two devices are there. I thought do I want to
be the guy who sleeps with the watch? I slept with my watch on as a kid, like a
student for years, and then I left that behind and I agree it's like watch on,
watch off, what's going on. I think in Apple's ideal world you would do
essentially maybe one of two things. You would commit entirely to the Apple
health tracking lifestyle where you would be doing your sleep data, you'd be
tracking your mindful minutes, you'd be inputting your caffeine level and the
amount of water that you drank and then you'd be doing a quick ECG and then
you'd be monitoring that and then it would just be stacking and then somehow
your entire world would fall apart and you would actually cause more stress in
your life than the mindfulness you tried to achieve through the data tracking. So
there's that. Or they just want you to buy multiple watches so in your case
Jason you would never have to worry about actually charging the watch while
you're showering or something because you would just go straight from the
Aluminium slash aluminum model in your sleep to the stainless steel
Fanciness for during the day. I I did do that actually
I had I had my regular watch and then I had another watch called sleepy time watch and
I would go back and forth between the two. It still sucked. I didn't like doing that either
It was still annoying because now you've got the two watches
Usually it would switch back and forth properly, but sometimes it didn't it's just was too much work
I do track all that other crap you talked about
Pretty reliably give or take but yeah, the sleep one is just no Jason lives the quantified life
Andrew do you sleep with your eye devices?
I'm often on sleeping with my watch way more than I used to so with this new series 4
I do it a lot more because the battery can take it and I like the wake-up haptics
The alarm is really useful. So that's really good for me
So I do sleep at probably probably 60% of the time. I would sleep with my my watch on
I'm bit random with what is beside me on the bed some I've got like a little charging station in another room and sometimes
Everything ends up on that charging station. There's nothing on the bed next to it next to me. Sounds like you need air power
Hmm, I'd be lovely other times
Sometimes there might be two iPhones and an iPad next to me on the table and nothing fits.
And it's like, "Ahh!"
Because I'm either reading in bed on the iPad or reading RSS feeds or whatever nerdy thing.
And you just chuck it down.
A phone may have got itself there.
It's totally random.
I'm not sleeping with it because I feel a compulsion or anything.
It's just the way life plays out on a particular day.
I forgot about the watch alarm.
I do wear my watch any night or I have to actually wake up at a given time
because the watch alarm little buzzy thing on your wrist is by far the most pleasant way to wake up
in terms of alarms. There's nothing better than that.
I'll sleep through any noise. You could have a truck start its engine next to me and then
beep its air horn. I won't wake up. But a little taptic on my wrist? Yeah, I'm there.
I use the watch as my alarm on my bedside table and I actually have the noise on and it's amazing
if you were to see me and how I wake up in the morning I look absolutely out of it and groggy
I'm a mess I'm not a morning person at all how Jason gets up to do this I have no idea at this
time but me either because I'm determined to stay in bed and I want that thing to shut up
the amazing dexterity that I have with my index finger to go down on that tiny little side button
across an arm's length away to shut it up, I'm amazed at what I can achieve when I want to keep
sleeping. Seriously. In the morning I'm just like, what's happening? Like, where am I? The world is a
mystery to me and I don't know how to do anything. I don't know how to silence a phone or anything.
I'm just like confused. I had the same radio alarm clock earlier in my life for about 15 years. I
never worked that thing out for the morning. I knew how to work it. Nighttime, I knew what to do.
I knew what all the buttons did but come you know wake up time like
"Ahh! Snooze! Like what do I do?"
I'm not good in the morning.
It's like being boring every day.
[Music]
Media Corner. Media Corner! Killing me here. All right so this week for Media Corner I set a little
bit of a challenge. For those listeners who have been paying attention you might know that on Apple
Music we went through the wonderful effort for all of you in making a playlist, a shared playlist,
called Hemispheric Tunes. The idea being that we would share some of our favorite songs from across
the two different hemispheres. I, planet Earth, there are only two hemispheres. And I thought
today we would go through and choose ideally one favorite song from each of us. I know how many
Jason added to this playlist so we'll see how that goes. One favorite song or I suppose I'll
allow a couple of songs that mean something to us. Do one of you two want to go first?
I just want to say that if you want to find the playlist I believe if you go to hemisphericviews.com/tunes
it will give you the playlist. You can search directly in Apple Music for hemispheric views.
it will also turn up. There you go. Two ways to get there. I can go first with my song then. Go
ahead. So my song is called War on Drugs by Bare Naked Ladies. I bought this on CD many, many years
ago. It was ordered because I couldn't get it in Australia, so it was an international order,
but it wasn't from Amazon. It was from like a CD shop, like an online CD shop, and I was trying
to remember what it was but I can't for the life of me think. I think it had a blue logo
if that helps anybody if you can help me out and remind me what it was.
Was it like a chain like a Tower Records kind of thing?
Or it was like an Amazon version I think this was when Amazon was only books
virtually and it was like the Amazon equivalent.
Like cdwarehouse.net or something.
And it was kind of like the leader of its time anyway be that as it may it no longer exists
obviously. But I was very excited to receive the CD album and I listened to it many, many times
in my first home that I'd bought. I have memories. You know how in music you can place where you are
when you hear it again, you're like it takes you back to a time and a place. And this song in
particular takes me back to a time and a place when I was cleaning the glass on our front window,
front on the windows of our front door for whatever reason that might be. And I had it turned
up very loud on our venue energy speakers. Still going on today. Anyway, that's the backstory.
Planned obsolescence. Yes. So Hannah introduced me to Banned Naked Ladies. I didn't know much
about them before that, but I got this CD. I really liked it, but there was something about
this particular song, and I think it's the fact that it has a high level of sadness and melancholy.
It's linked to depression and mental health issues.
And for some reason all that resonates with me.
And you know, that's why I love it.
If you hear it, it's kind of dreary, but there's something in it that I still kind of...
It gives me hope.
If you read the lyrics and try and make sense of it, it is very kind of like,
"Oh, this terrible thing happened."
And so it's not a joyous, uplifting song by any means.
But there's just something about it that every time I hear it, I'm like,
"It feels comfortable."
Never get tired of it. And it also has really great, just the instrumentals and stuff as well, if you don't listen to it for its lyrics.
I think the instrumentals are really nice. It's enjoyable. War on Drugs, Bare Naked Ladies.
Is it perhaps because it's dealing with stuff in the lyrics so bluntly and so openly, it's almost cathartic?
Yeah, it could be. Could be. And to be fair as well, I'm not like a deep listener to lyrics a lot of the time.
Like a lot of time I'll think a song means something and then I'll turn out later,
"Oh look at it more deeply" and I'm like "Oh it doesn't actually mean what I thought it meant".
It often just that brings me to think of a couple of friends that I
had in my past, haven't had. You know one of them who suffered badly at the hands of
illicit drugs and ultimately is no longer with us on this earth. And another who struggled and
struggled and actually has made it through and has turned his life around and is you know like
like 100% now. And so that kind of makes me think that Scourge, even though the song isn't
about that, it still makes me think about that.
Jason, could you choose one out of the however many 30 you added or something?
I picked 15 songs to go through today. I actually didn't. I picked one because you said to pick
Wow. So we're learning. I hope that's good. I'm picking the song but I'm more
picking the group which is Primus. I think the song that was on there was
"My Name is Mud" I think but I mean the song is I love the song it's it's kind
of a nostalgia thing for me I think like you said Andrew when you hear it you're
like boom I'm in like XYZ place for sure and that's like an album where if it
had been a cassette tape it probably would have been worn out from the number
of times it was played but fortunately CDs spin forever so there you go and it
was I think one of the first CDs I ever got I believe that was that one that was
the not the plastic case but it was like the the cardboard like folding thing
that had a little plastic insert thing I think that was that album if I remember
right when they went cheaper yeah I hated those they never fit on the shelf
properly and have all the jewel cases lined up and then they were like thinner
and then quite yeah then they kind of REM did that to me with one of theirs
still remember it I had a whole sequence of REM albums all the same and then one
stupid cardboard one yeah I think it was around the Sun damn you guys I didn't
pick it because of the cardboard I actually picked it because it was the
first band that I ever listened to that so every bit it seems like in general
I'm very much generalizing here, but it's like you have a band, there's a lead singer,
quote unquote, maybe plays guitar, maybe doesn't.
Then there's the, you know, lead guitar, then there's kind of the drummer and then there's
kind of everyone else.
If there is anyone else, right?
That's generally speaking, that's how it kind of goes.
Martin, Martin, just inter, does that sound a lot like the makeup of YouTube?
I reckon they're preloading the song on everyone's phones right now.
Yeah.
If you go to the Hemisphere, if you use playlist now, it's just gonna be overtaxed.
It's just a link to that stupid album.
Gotcha.
So, that's kind of your general makeup of a band, right?
So, the thing that really stood out to me from Primus is it kind of flipped the whole
thing on its head in that Les Claypool was the front person, front man for this group,
he was the bass player and everything revolved around his bass playing.
I mean, he's insane.
What he can, the sounds he can produce with a bass guitar.
It was the very first time that I ever heard something that was like that,
where it wasn't just regular guy playing, you know, kind of the same four chords
on a guitar shouting about something, which is not bad, I listened to plenty
of that kind of stuff, but this was just like, wait, how are they allowed to do
Can they have the bass player be the main focus of the entire group?
And not just for one song, that was the group.
It was him with everyone else.
And it was just very, very different from anything else that ever...
And that's always stood out to me, that they were able to do that and make it work pretty
consistently for a very long time.
It wasn't just a gimmick.
So that's the reason that I picked it.
overall they had a lot of weird shit they did, they had a lot of great stuff they did, but
that that's my my reasoning and I'm sticking to it. Well I want to applaud you on managing to
choose one song from what I think was your own playlist in the playlist. Yes, success. So out of
the ones that I put there it was very hard to choose but the song that stands out to me kind
of like what you were saying Jason as an influential group or something that sticks in your head in
in your own personal history. There's a song there called You Sound Like Louis Baudet by a band
called The Whitlams. Now, if people have been paying attention to this podcast on a previous
media corner, Andrew brought up an Australian podcast called The Eleventh. Am I right there,
Andrew? Yes. Yes, which was about former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. This band,
The Whitlams, is named after that same former Prime Minister. Synergy is what they call that.
Exactly. And the Whitlams, look, I don't know what you think of them, Andrew. I don't think
you're necessarily familiar with them, Jason. They're very Australian. But this is a band that
has been within my family and my listening for years. Like I remember listening to this band on
like road trips to Sydney or to see family members and stuff. It was always an album called Eternal
Nightcap that was on in the car. And You Sound Like Louis Bedet is this particular song, which
which I think has come to form my own taste in music.
It's kind of this, I don't know how you'd explain,
white man alternative pop rock driven by piano,
and it has lyrical density to it.
So when you listen to it,
it's actually sung by lead vocalist Tim Friedman
about a guy who was like this eccentric avant-garde musician
who he shared a place with in the Sydney suburb of Tempe.
And the whole song is just about drinking and being stupid
living this ridiculous musician's life, which I do not live in the slightest, but I remember
as a kid being in the car, hearing them sing about these ridiculous words like, for example,
one of the lines is "by the time we get to Marrickville, they'll be masturbating". And
I just thought as a kid, what the hell does that mean? Oh, and I learned lots of interesting
terms from this song. So if you want to give the Whitlam's a try, I might have just put
you off. But to me they're kind of the sound of Sydney or maybe broader New South Wales
and it's so much a part of my psyche and it's a very odd song and has these funky elements
to it. You should give it a try.
Truth, beauty and a picture of you.
This is a hemispheric divide type question that I'm curious about. Socks. What kind of
Socks do you wear not brand? I don't care about that. You know, this is
More about style of sock like you got like the long tube sock you got the ankle sock the no-show sock
You know, whatever crew sock. I'm no sock expert
So that's number one kind of stemming from the shoe discussion. I got me thinking about socks a little bit, right? Yeah
Let's get the full sock
discussion
Under our belts don't put socks under your belts. That's my first bit of sock advice. Oh, that's fair
Yeah, that's probably that would be weird
It's funny you say that because Natasha did actually make a belt made entirely out of socks for like a dress-up thing at school once
So she did precisely what you said not to do Wow, but I'm sure no one will know that I've put it on the podcast
That's incredible. So in answering Jason's question, okay, so growing up I was a real I'm wearing
Just regular white socks with a bit of an ankle thing to them and I looked upon people who wore ankle socks
Not with a sense of disdain but a sense of befuddlement and confusion
I thought who are these people who can go around displaying their ankles so much, you know what I mean?
Quick side note when you say ankle sock
Is this covering the little ankle nubbin or is this like at or below the ankle nubbin?
This is below the ankle nubbin. So funnily enough it is an ankle-less sock, but we refer to it as
showing off the ankle. Nowadays if I'm wearing shoes with shorts
we're talking summertime or something I will have ankle socks on right
generally black ones they kind of blend in with the black converse thing that
I'll wear. Other than that if we're talking about underneath jeans or longer
pants or something work or non-work situations I prefer a sock that covers
the ankle and while I'm you know partial to a plain black sock ever since
Since meeting Natasha, I have diversified and engaged in more fun in my sock life.
And right here, right now, I'm wearing blue and orange socks that cover the ankle with
little slots hanging off trees.
And I've actually just pulled this off my foot.
And you'll see this in the show notes, people.
That's what we want, show note pictures.
Thank you.
Love it.
There you go.
So that is the sock.
And in addition to that, I've got socks with a print of socks on them.
So socks on socks.
Do those socks have prints of socks?
Wow.
I don't know if the resolution was good enough for necessarily the thread count or whatever you call it
but actually I'm glad you brought that up because I'm gonna have to look for socks on socks on socks
like a Dr. Seuss situation
You probably want Egyptian cotton at that point
Pixels per thread I think is what they... that's the sock term
Pixels per thread, that's it
That's what they say in the biz anyway
So to sum up, I'm not really full on about socks
I just enjoy a bit of a variety and in summertime I want my ankles to breathe
- Yeah.
- It's good, good summary.
- Andrew, what's your, what's your,
I know you got socks with like basketballs on them.
- I'm not particular about socks, but I have views.
If I'm doing sport, I like to be wearing a white sock.
Predominantly that sport would be basketball,
in which case the sock is a short one.
So it's like just covering the ankle nubbin.
It's not your little tiny socket or sock, sock,
whatever those things are called.
It's a sport sock that is just above the ankle nubbin.
I like that, I like showing my ankle when I play basketball.
It's just a thing.
You know, basically if you were wearing a high top shoe,
you basically wouldn't really see sock.
- That's a power move.
- Yeah.
Says athlete and they need to be white.
Really important that they're white.
Now, then you go into normal, like,
you can wear those socks also if you're just wearing casual,
you know, you're just wearing shorts and shoes,
they work well for that.
If you're then moving into more like,
I'm gonna wear pants, I like a black sock.
And I like that sock to have the cushioning on the bottom of it. I want some squishy sock
At the bottom. Yeah, so sort of reinforced ankle toe cap situation
But with extra padding on the on the surface of the foot really important to get that cushioning
Which is great for about the first six months of a socks life after that. They start to go a bit crusty
Yes, you need to think about that whether you're gonna persevere with the crusty sock and just you know
maybe add a little bit of extra fabric softener when you put it through the wash or whether you're gonna splurge on new socks.
Now I'm
notorious for keeping socks for way beyond their lifespan.
So I'm not one to really give advice about buying new socks because I am a bit tight.
But those socks should be black and I like them to be sort of, I like to have a relatively thick or like tall ankle
holder upper elastic bit. I hate it when socks fall down.
So I want a good rear, but I don't want them so tight that they're cutting off my circulation.
Or when you take them off you're left with the indents
Around your leg, you know, that's too tight and that's horrible
I'm always concerned about that. What are the long-term effects of sock indents and someone researched this? Hmm
It's probably good for deep vein thrombosis. Oh, you think it's a good thing?
You're probably right actually and I've had vein surgery
So I should know that I give you those tight things if you want to travel on a plane, right?
So, you know just get a pair of two tight socks, but no not one for
Fancy socks or like, you know outlandish ones. This shocks me. That's not me
I do actually have a few pairs of them that somebody gave to me
But as well as them being outlandish and that's sort of a challenge already
they're also too small and I think that's I don't think they really make a lot of outlandish socks in a
Jumbo size Jason. I think the thing here is that in the professional corporate world in which?
Andrew it is engaging the only room for creative expression is a tie
That's why I was shocked. I thought you would be like I know whenever I used to wear the s-word in
previous
employment situations I
would always have some kind of dumb socks on just as like kind of a
It's like a metaphor for a middle finger for for the suit, you know, it's like yeah
I'm wearing this idiot thing, but look at my socks that have like
Monkeys holding bananas in suggestive ways or something
If you're gonna embrace it embrace it, you know, if you're gonna be corporate and wear something nice
Go fully nice. Don't muck around with silly socks. Jason and I don't really enjoy wearing suits
You'd like wearing a suit. See he likes a suit. I wore a suit the other day
It's been a long time since I've worn a suit. I had to be honest. I had to squeeze myself into these suits
I've packed on a few kilos. I've actually got two new suits on the way
I ordered I got some new suits made a couple weeks ago
Made was this on the yacht while you were on the phone to George Clooney or buy off the rack no no no wait
No, no wait you had you paid for the tailor to come on the boat, and they also enjoyed the hors d'oeuvres yeah
When does Jenkins deliver the suits I actually I got a call from the suit the suit company today
They should be with me for a fitting next week late next week
Oh, do you get to meet with the guy that's got the little measuring tape around his around his neck and he's got the little
Chalk thing and all that. Yeah. Yeah do all that Wow
This is named Niles or Jeeves or something. No, no, no, let's no
No, I mean when you're when you're at that when you're at that level of your life
No, I don't refer to people you don't refer to people by their name. They're simply Taylor
Underling yeah, yeah, he would never acknowledge him with a name. That's so
Yeah
So yeah, I'm looking forward to getting my new suits right and because when I was wearing this suit last week
I was like, oh, it's a bit tight
Jeez, it feels good
It's not often you have to wear a suit and tie and anything anymore
But for the particular purpose that I was out out in the town for you need a suit apart from the tie
Just feeling good. Everything felt good had the cufflinks whole bit. Do you know it felt super good taking it all off?
No, black socks. I knew I had black socks. There's no silliness about that outfit
business head to toe
Wow power move. Okay, so Jason you're not into black socks
You wanna you want to you know challenge the system?
I would go and sit next to Andrew and then put my leg
I would cross my leg in such a way that the sock would show and it just says like
On it or something now with this be your inside sock or your outside sock because you know
I would have it just on the inside facing just so you could see it and no one else just as a little jab
And then I would immediately leave because I do not belong wherever you are wearing a suit for sure
I think you'd fit right in Wow. Okay. I'm a little thrown off by you not having fun
I thought for sure you're gonna have a whole collection of fun socks, but I guess not
Do I look like a fun person to you? Not anymore you did
But now it's like okay. I don't know why you're not wearing a suit to record to be perfectly honest
I thought you'd be like, I'll be there in five just putting you know, getting the suit measured when I get the new one
I'll wear it to my I'll wear it to the next podcast. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, I
Love a fun sock unlike some people I do wear Bamba socks
Sponsor what a bomb of socks
below the nubbin below I
Don't know. Maybe that's not it. That's like a sponsor on like so many podcasts here in the US that sock company
I don't know if you guys can I be clear though?
Would you wear socks below the ankle nubbin as you call it under long pants because that's what freaks me out
I don't want my ankle rubbing bear. Here you go
The pants do not dare touch my ankle nubbin
Thank you. It's weed. It is cringe worthy to have a pant touch a nubbin
Mm-hmm. Don't don't do that. No shorts. You get the below the nubbin socks pretty easy pretty standard
Anything that's not a short is a long sock
mid calf
probably type of thing
Normal sock. Yeah, you don't wear the knee. You don't wear knee highs and then you know folded, you know
No, no, no, I've got no sock that is that tall
Under his tunic is that what you're suggesting?
The only problem with the with the ankle socks is there's really nothing worse than a sock
Slipping down underneath the heel in a shoe. That is one of the worst things that can happen
But it's something you have to deal with sometimes and that is where the new sock old sock thing comes into play because when they
Start wearing out the slippage rate increases pretty exponentially as that sock gets older
so that becomes an issue in my younger years of
just
Waste everything I at one point thought that it might be an idea to live the
Because there's okay, so there's nothing worse than a sock going under the shoe
There's nothing better than a brand new pair of socks fresh out of the package
That is just heaven right there. So at one point I thought what if every day
Was new sock day, huh? You bought new socks for everybody's got the money for that car. I didn't actually do it
I didn't actually do it. But the thought crossed my mind
If you could have new socks every day it could change your life
You could be having the worst day ever, but you have you have new socks. So it's like magically fixed. I didn't do it
that's super wasteful, but
You know if there's like an alternate universe that I'm in right now. I
Might be wearing new socks every day and that might be okay. I got a question
How do you feel that making sure that your socks match?
That's a good question. I was gonna ask you do you ever wear mismatched socks? I can't do it. I would say no
I don't think that only on accident. It would be a complete oversight
But wouldn't that be your ultimate protest Jason to wear?
Colorful socks that don't match under a suit just to say, you know what? I really don't care
I mean at that point I might as well just start burning buildings down right because at that point they're basically the same thing
Yeah, I mean you're going from
I'm
Sticking it to the suit guy over here - now. I'm just burning this whole building down because it's just complete anarchy at that point
I've been known
to
realize that there's a hole at the toe and simply say well, that's
It was on the left foot. That's not going on the right foot problem solved
So once you've got a hole on each side, then you say goodbye. Yeah, but if this still comes to otherwise good
(upbeat music)
In Toyota news, I got a message from the Toyota dealership.
My car has now been manufactured.
- Ah.
- It's come off the line.
It's expected in the late July shipment.
- Is this stage six of lean manufacturing?
- Oh, I'll tell you what, I'm starting to have my doubts
about lean manufacturing.
Seems to be taking an awful long bloody time to get a car.
- It sure looked good on paper.

Ciao Hemispheric Views guys, this is For Your Fun.
