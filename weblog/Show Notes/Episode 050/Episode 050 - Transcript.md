Hi I'm Andrew and I'm Jason and I'm Martin this is hemispheric views.
So what the hell's going on today guess what today is Tuesday Saturday.
Okay should I more specific guess what episode number this is today 49 no.
51 close no I don't know trivia corner a C option is 50th.
Wow we've been doing this for 50 years that the shortest on an ounce trivia corner we've had yeah I'm still working on my technique I'm not really good at it it was so unannounced that you act we didn't actually know it was happening until you.
A, 49, B, 51, or C, 50th episode.
But on the 50th episode theme, I wanted to bring the Hemispheric branding into two little segments that I thought we could discuss.
A bit of fun, something a bit weird and different for this 50th episode spectacular.
And Natasha kindly gave us some names that actually rhyme with our own show title.
And I thought it would be fun to do this.
So the first one is Hemispheric Bruise.
Hemispheric Bruise.
Now, bruise, that's what happens when you injure yourself.
So I thought it'd be funny if we actually discuss our worst or funniest personal injuries.
Did you two manage to come up with an example of this?
I did. Andrew, you first.
I actually had an impromptu injury yesterday.
Doesn't this is not this is not my answer.
It's like, do you plan your injuries normally?
No, we've had a few injuries in our household this week.
So the first one, I'm going to get this on my chest, okay guys. The first one, I got stung by a bee yesterday. So my finger, I was pulling a leaf out of a pool, didn't realize there was a bee on there, on the leaf. Bee got angry and stung me. So that wasn't nice.
So you're not allergic to bees, I take it.
No, not at all. Except it hurts.
The other injury in the house this week is the hemispheric bruise in the universe.
My six year old son's broken his leg this week.
So that's just hemispheric bruise adjacent.
The six year old with a cast around his leg.
This is going to be fun six to eight weeks.
How's he going? Is he okay?
Yeah, he's okay. We got him a wheelchair now and he's actually loving that.
Turning around.
Good for him.
Yeah is he loving the fact that he can scoot himself around the most or is it that he actually asks to be pushed and enjoys the service?
No he wants to drive himself so what he does need to do is he needs to be lifted into the chair and stuff he doesn't have any mobility it only happened like three days ago so this is early days yet.
Have you drawn our logo on the cast yet?
That's a good point.
That would be my first question.
I've written my name but didn't do the logo good point alright.
Merch opportunity.
Like Andrew Canyon was here.
Like a property of or like is that.
I just.
If lost, please return to.
No, I just did something boring like dad and I love heart.
That's sweet.
Anyway, sorry, that's all by the by.
We're here for my worst or funniest injury, right?
I'm going to give you my funniest one, I think.
So I was in high school.
It was either year 11 or year 12.
I can't quite remember, but they're the two last years of school.
And we had outdoor basketball courts.
Bitumen.
Jason, does bitumen- is that a thing in America?
Does that make sense?
No, please elaborate.
Would they say asphalt, but we would say asphalt?
Tarmac.
Okay, I got you.
So, some road type surface.
Yeah, yeah, they'll do.
Okay.
Okay.
Ground.
We'll call it ground.
Yes.
And back in those days, I was relatively athletic, but we had those basketball hoops that, Martin,
you'll be familiar with this, outdoor basketball hoops that are on a pivoting pole.
And on one side, there's a basketball hoop, and on the other side, there's a netball ring.
Familiar with those?
That does sound familiar.
Yes.
Yeah.
So you could adjust for the sport.
Yes.
And you would spin them around 180 degrees so that the ring you needed was on the court,
Because a netball court and a basketball court are very similar in size.
Oh, okay.
Anyway, by the by.
So there was, there was theoretically somewhere in that school, this big pole
that you could reach up and hook into a hoop and pull the ring around to spin it
around 180 degrees.
Okay.
That pole was a thing of lore and legend because it was never, I don't think I ever
saw it.
So what we used to do is you would get one candidate would elect to jump up and they would grab hold of the basketball ring with their hands and hang down and other kids would grab your legs and you would be a human pole and they would pull you around.
Standard practice, right?
Sure.
Because I was tall and I could jump.
I was one of those candidates that would often jump up, grab hold of the ring and get pulled around to get the basketball court set up for us at lunchtime.
One day I jumped and it just didn't quite go right.
This is a long time ago now so my memory is a little bit fuzzy but in terms of how
it actually happened. But I grabbed the ring but
I think my forward momentum or something was off
and it was a hot day my hand slipped off the rim
which means I tumbled back to the ground but my legs were swung forward so I
landed on my coccyx.
Oh no.
Straight on your butt basically but hitting my coccyx.
Yeah you did.
On bitumen.
Ow.
Now I thought I was paralyzed.
I really thought I'd done, I'd killed myself or at least paralyzed myself.
Because it hurt but it didn't hurt at first.
And the worst thing is at school that age, you don't get a lot of sympathy from your peers.
They just laugh at you.
Yeah so you're effectively paralyzed on the ground fearing for your life and everyone made fun of you after they failed to secure you.
Yes that's right.
To be fair that's perfectly in line with the time frame in which this happened.
So the last element of the story is then I went to the office and said I've just really hurt myself I need to go home this really hurts I can't see it like everything hurts.
And they just had no appreciation for what I just done to myself and they said I'll just go lay down in the sick bay for a while and you'll be fine.
That's also classic response.
It's like the equivalent of walk it off but it's like lay it off.
Yeah and the thing is I couldn't lay down because it hurt my coccyx too much so I didn't get to go home from school early I was hurt and that stayed hurt for a few weeks at least.
It was agony and that is my hemispheric bruise.
I wanted to know the chairs that they had you sitting on in the sickbay were they the classic, see it might be different in Western Australia from New South Wales, were they kind of really squared off dark grey or brown metal legs that were hollow and it was like a vinyl rectangular seat cushion either like beige or dark blue.
I know the thing you're talking about. I know it. I don't think it was one of those. I think the chair was more like one of those molded plastic ones.
You know, they have the-
Oh no, like an actual school chair.
Yeah. Yeah.
So there wasn't even cushioning.
No.
No.
I'm just imagining now the Simpsons, like when they get those new posture correcting chairs and all the kids are like bent, like out of proportion in odd angles to restore their lumbar position.
I'm pretty old, right? So, this was the 90s. And so, this is like before anybody really gave a damn.
Yeah. Kids were expendable.
So, you actually smelt like teen spirit.
Yeah, I really did. And it hurt.
But in a few months time, I was back to dunking again.
But I never again volunteered to be the guy that would jump up and be the stick.
You learned a lesson.
I did.
That's good.
Now, Jason, you're into sports.
What was your injury?
Oh yeah, so we're doing football things and I was running to the back field and I
lobbed the bomb. What? No, no sports injuries whatsoever. I don't think I've ever actually
broken anything, which I think you're supposed to say out loud. I think that's one of those
things you want to make sure you say out loud and then it happens directly.
Watch out for those stairs later on today.
Yep.
Yep.
I am constantly hurting myself. It's a hard thing to pick and there's not really just one that
stands out. I mean, you said fell down the stairs. I just did that recently, full flight,
all the way down. That was pretty exciting.
Did you get the "uh" down the page too?
Oh yeah. Yep, I did. Yeah. And it simultaneously went forever and it was very fast at the same
time. And the whole time I thought I was similar to Andrew.
I actually thought I was like, I'm going to die.
I'm this is, this was it.
I'm dead now.
I'm going to be dead any second.
One of these stairs is going to be the one that does it, but I'm still here.
So I did not die.
Um, the ones that I guess stick out the most in terms of not really funny, but
this one, one of them was really dumb in basic military training.
I was going through a, I guess you could call it like an obstacle course thing.
And where you're like climbing over one thing and then like going under like
razor wire and doing all this crap.
Right.
And I jumped off of something into what I thought was just sand underneath the
sand about just barely covered with sand.
It was a giant, giant rock.
landed on it with my knee directly right on it.
- Oh.
- So painful.
But being that this was basic military training,
if you do something where you injure yourself,
you risk being washed out to a new group,
meaning you repeat that entire week,
or if you miss, you roll back.
So everybody you've been going through this with,
you're all one group,
you risk being washed out and go back to a new group or you go into the sick
bay and you're there until whatever.
So I just pretended like it was fine.
Uh, and went through the rest of it with, with what was probably a horrible.
Thing to do, but the military.
So there you go.
That was not ideal.
It was very gross and purple and giant and could not bend very much.
And every morning at, I think it was four o'clock AM,
doing our physical training every morning
was a blast with a completely effed knee.
- Did you have like, was there one of the people
going with you, were they like the medic in training?
So could you call out like, "Medic!"
(laughing)
- That would have been nice.
I did get, I recall several times in the evenings
of people seeing this train wreck of a knee
and being like, you should probably talk to somebody
about that.
And it's like, nah, I'm good.
We're gonna just, we're just gonna go,
we're gonna work through this.
- All right, Martin.
- Okay, well, my injuries never come from anything brave
or particularly daring.
So I'm gonna bring up two injuries for you fairly briefly
that everyone in my family would probably
dub a Martin injury.
The first one was when I was in year 10 at high school.
And just to clarify for our American listeners,
that's not like I was in the senior years of high school
for 10 years, which probably sounds like a very long time.
It's like, how old are you?
Like 32 by now or something.
We were on a school trip to Fraser Island,
which is off the mainland, off the coast of Queensland.
I think actually nowadays it's properly referred
to as Kigari, so I don't want to get that wrong,
which is its original First Nations name.
But anyway, when we were there,
we were basically arriving to go on the trip
for over a week.
And one of the teachers had this wise idea,
oh, look, there's these logs next to the water
that are like tiered for photos.
Let's go and take photos there.
Anyway, on that, during the group shot,
I think I might've actually mentioned this before,
I actually slipped off because of barnacles under my shoes
and ripped open my arm in parallel scarring with barnacles
and had to nurse it for the rest of the trip
and people thought I'd like been scratched
by some sort of dingo or something.
Using that as the example of a felled injury,
the one that I actually wanna mention is,
do you know like little tissue packets that you get
how to have that little adhesive sticker?
- Yep, the little individual tissues.
- Have you ever sliced yourself on one of those before?
- No.
I don't think on one of those particularly now.
- When you lift that little adhesive tab
on a packet of plastic pocket tissues,
If that slips underneath your thumbnail,
- Ooh. - Yeah.
- That's a good one. - And slices the sensitive
skin under the nail, that is one of the worst injuries
that you can ever receive.
So for a good week after that,
I was unable to really grip anything
between my index finger and thumb
because a packet of pocket tissues
had rendered my thumb unusable.
So my hemispheric bruises are always in the form of things
that actually are in no way daring and are fairly mundane.
- That makes me really happy actually,
because you can ask Valerie about this,
but I at least probably three to five times a week
will just be randomly bleeding somehow from something
without knowing why or how it happened.
But all of a sudden I'll just look and be like,
well, there's blood all over my arm.
Like what even happened there?
(upbeat music)
- All right, well that brings us
to the second rhyming segment, which is Hemispheric Muse.
Now this segment is about your biggest idol
or who inspires you.
Thought this would be a good one because,
know, 50 episodes in, people have listened to us for a little while. I think they get who we are
as characters, but maybe there's something from our past or some major influence that explains
who we are, why we kind of fill these roles in this show. Jason, do you want to start this time
and share maybe who your hemispheric muse or muses are? - Let's see here. My hemispheric
Muse. This is very difficult to answer.
- Good.
- Good. Why is that good?
- It's interesting. Good to see the thought process.
- I feel like there's a lot of easy answers in the sense of the kind of usual suspects of people
that are famous and so forth. But I think I would actually go back to a teacher that I had.
I mean, no one's going to know who it is. So that doesn't, that's irrelevant to the, to the story,
but it was the kind of teacher that took the time to understand who his audience was
and tailoring it to that versus just showing up, teaching the subject and leaving and truly taking
the time to personalize as much as possible, obviously, to each individual's need and how
that they needed the information to be given to them so they could best absorb this. And it was a
physics class. So it was kind of ultra important for that because that is arguably a difficult
subject depending on who you are and how you take that because there's science,
there's math, there's, there's everything all wrapped up into one.
And I just feel like that was one of maybe two experiences within the
education time that I've had in my life that I actually thought was useful and
happy that I was a part of it.
Whereas most educational interactions are kind of like the usual, why am I here?
This is a waste of my time.
This is a waste of their time.
No, one's getting anything out of this.
We're just checking boxes.
So I think that teacher was inspirational in a sense that it kind of made me want
to be a teacher and I still have some bit of me that wants to do that.
I don't know if that'll ever happen or if I would try it and it would be terrible.
But I like to think that if I took and kind of molded myself around their style
and their path that they took with all of us,
that might actually be helpful to someone else
and make them think, wow, maybe school
is not completely dumb.
It's a tough one just because no one can really relate to it,
but maybe you can in the sense that you had a teacher/professor/whatever
somewhere in your school history.
- So even though you don't teach formally or professionally
like what you were saying you might consider doing,
Are there ever any times where you think
that you're being a teacher or transmitting knowledge
generally in other things that you do?
Because I mean, teaching can be broader.
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.
When I say teaching, I guess I mean like traditional,
I am teacher, you are student,
you're here to do the school thing.
But yeah, I would say literally every day
of everything that I do from a work capacity
is effectively teaching.
It's taking information, creating and turning it
into something that is digestible
and understandable by others.
I guess, yeah, to your point, yes, you are correct.
- I like being correct, so thank you.
- You get one today.
- Well, yeah, I think that's probably a good way to do it
because I look at the amount of work
that the Natasha brings home as a formal teacher,
a little bit terrifying sometimes.
So maybe the way you're teaching is good now.
- Yeah, I always wonder if maybe it's better
to just keep that as like a, what if I did that kind of thought
versus actually trying to pursue it?
'Cause I may end up with,
oh, that's not anything like I was hoping it was going to be.
- That's a cool muse answer, actually.
So your hemispheric muse was your physics teacher.
- Yes.
- My turn?
Okay.
Teachers, that's a great example, Jason,
although I won't take that one.
Obviously, that bloody bird outside
that ruins all my podcast recordings is going.
- That was a bird?
- That sounded like an alarm.
I thought it was your iPhone.
I have been up to do podcast recordings of like six in the morning for stuff over sales and the sun rises and it's.
I thought it was either a horrible ringtone or a truck backing up.
I think it's both of those wrapped up into a feathered beast.
I think it needs to become a new segment great music.
Yeah, I think so.
But you could hear that.
Oh yeah.
I love it.
It's not that it's cockatoos or-
Keep it in.
Lorikeets.
What kind of bird is that?
Because it's going to have to go in the notes.
I'm not actually sure, but I can check with a bird loving relative what it might be.
Okay.
I believe it's called Bloody Annoying Bird.
Yeah.
Or Babs for short.
Yeah.
Back to my muse.
I kind of went down the media path, I suppose, and the two muses, I suppose, separate but interrelated would be
British comedians Monty Python and Ricky Gervais, respectively.
And I'm not putting cards on myself as some sort of comedian here, or like I followed that path.
But when I think about my childhood, growing up and watching that stuff really guided my
sense of humor or world outlook. So when I look at Monty Python and Ricky Gervais,
in fact, maybe I'll just focus on Ricky Gervais for this example.
There's this kind of nothing is sacred, everything can be made fun of.
of mentality that he takes in his approach to comedy.
And if you aren't a Ricky Gervais person, people listening,
and you haven't watched some of his shows
like "The Office UK" or "Extras"
or even recently things like "Afterlife",
you might've seen stuff like his "Golden Globes" appearances
and how he completely shreds Hollywood or critiques people
and brings up very uncomfortable things.
I really admire that as a way that he works.
And whenever I get a little bit too uptight
about something or think that you can't make fun of it
or that you should be a bit more diplomatic.
I look at him and I think he's survived.
He's made a great career out of this
and inspired a lot of people.
And on top of that,
he also makes fun of himself relentlessly.
So he's very aware of his status
as now a very well-off white British guy
who can kind of say whatever he wants about anything.
So I think it's kind of a good life philosophy
or outlook to have that's kind of guided me a bit
my sense of humor and my outlook that if you think that something can't be made fun of,
don't hold back, critique it, have a bit of a go at it because the only way that healthy
discourse kind of functions or even democracy as we were talking about in our most recent
One Prime Plus episode is when you can make fun of things and critique it.
He's the one that plays Steve Carell in The Office, is that correct?
Exactly, yeah.
Okay, got it.
Are either of you two Ricky Gervais people?
I went to a phase but not really.
I know.
This is a conversation.
I find it a bit annoying to be honest.
Oh, can you expand on that?
Um, no.
I got nothing.
I just don't just don't really like he was great in the office.
He was great in the office, but I just his his style just doesn't doesn't work for me in general.
Sorry, I got no justification. It's an emotional feeling.
Do you guys want to fight about the office versions? Or I guess we could do that at some point.
You can bring it up briefly now if you want.
No, that seems to be things that people get upset about.
The British ones, superior.
I would say they're actually two very different shows. The problem is that because the first
series, or sorry, the first season of the US version, very closely mirrored or was based
on the story of the original UK one and it attracted those comparisons, really they ended
up being two very different shows. So if you're after something that's more of an American style
of humour and is more of maybe a laugh out loud funny or silly situation thing, that's where you
watch the US one. If you want something that's a really deliberately uncomfortable, cringeworthy,
suck the oxygen out of the room kind of approach, then you watch the UK one. The UK one is not
necessarily something that you laugh out loud watching. So I wouldn't even necessarily say
that they should be compared other than the fact that they have the same name.
But that's what makes the UK one great, is that you don't laugh out loud. You spend the whole
30 minutes or whatever just watching, just going, "Oh, oh."
Oh, and I prefer that. So I agree, I think the UK one is better,
but I understand that people have different needs or they want something different out of a show.
Is that the conflict that you wanted, Jason, or I kind of muted it?
Yeah, that'll do.
That'll do. All right. We can amp it up in post. You suck. Yeah, there you go. See,
we'll just I got a little soundboard of of Andrew insults and Martin insults. So we'll just kind of
like, like pong. Well, what would that sound like? Andrew would say,
sorry, I don't really have a justification. And Martin would be well, I think you will find that
dot dot dot examples in here. Yeah, it would be it would be more like the four second sound clips.
And then there's like the 45 minute sound clips.
That would be the difference.
Can you give us a rendition of each of us, Jason?
If you were imagining an argument between Andrew and Martin, what would it be?
Oh my God.
Play the roles.
I think Andrew is just kind of already looking at something else and just avoiding the situation.
And you are intently staring at without blinking for multiple, multiple tens of minutes.
Really?
Yeah.
and just zero facial expression of just dialogue go.
And it's probably between 25 to 45 minutes, generally.
No word is less than like probably eight syllables.
(laughing)
And that's kind of just how it goes.
And then once it's done, you're like,
"Whew, what happened there?"
So what's the next rhyming one?
- Well, actually I think it's Andrew's Muse.
Oh, perfect example.
I thought he already went.
I had a hard time with this one because right up until about 20 minutes ago, I didn't have
one.
I could not think of any, but I don't, not really an idols or like following the role
of somebody in a leadership sort of position.
I just don't go with that.
I did come up with a bit of a hemispheric muse.
And that person would be a Graham Mayberry, OAM no less.
Graham Mayberry, when I was a little boy,
I used to listen to talkback radio to fall asleep.
And it was on the radio,
it was the station 882 on the AM dial, 6PR.
And Graham Mayberry was a gentleman
who hosted a radio show called Nightline for 33 years.
People would call in, they'd talk to him,
he'd interview people, he had butchers on.
It was all sorts of different stuff.
You never knew what you were gonna get on Nightline.
It was really good.
A lot of old people, but for some reason,
I always felt comfortable in the company
of old people on the radio.
- This explains a lot.
- As like an 11-year-old boy.
It was like you had 50 grandmas
all talking to you every night.
It was very reassuring.
And to the point where when it was time for me
to do work experience at school,
I spent that work experience period at Radio 6PR,
which was pretty awesome.
Unfortunately, I was doing work experience during the day.
Graham Mayberry's shift was at night,
so I didn't really get to meet my hero.
But then he's just done so much.
Like he founded something,
an organization called Nightline.
Not Nightline, a founder called Lifeline.
And it started out as just like a little,
- Oh.
- Like, 'cause people would ring him in the radio,
like, you know, in dire situations,
and he recognized the need and created Lifeline.
And now that's grown to be one of the major,
like, mental health support centers in Australia.
It's really impressive to see, you know,
how it's grown over all the years.
And he helped like lots of people in, who are in need.
He was a pastor at a church and all this kind of stuff.
So he was really connected to the social fabric
of the city and he was a great radio host, awesome voice, really good radio guy.
And I think, well, if I look back, I'm like, well, now I'm doing podcasting and that's
kind of like modern day radio.
I'd spent some years on the board of a not-for-profit that was involved in helping people in need
of, you know, homelessness and domestic violence and financial crisis and all that kind of
stuff.
So I spent some time in that area.
And you see, you just think maybe his, listening to him every night did have a layer of influence.
Sounds like it.
Yeah.
And one of the funniest things, and it's all falling into place because last night with
Benji having his broken leg and he was having trouble falling asleep, I put on Apple Music
a song that Graham Mabry used to play every night at the end of his shift at midnight,
because I used to stay up stupid late listening to him, I couldn't fall asleep, I'd just be
listening.
And he would play this song called One Day at a Time.
various versions. I think Connie Lewis might have been or and I think it might have been a Charlie
Pride version as well but we'll check that out. But it's a very it's a very old sort of old style
song but it was very reassuring and it became like his trademark song. And I played it to Benji last
night and I listened to it and my whole mind was just taken back to this my own childhood and
listening to that. It always had a real calming influence on me. So I think Graham Mayberry,
my hemispheric muse.
Well, hang on.
Hang on.
What happened to hemispheric chews?
Well, I had to cut something because,
oh, OK, we can chat about it.
I don't mind. I took it out because.
Can we make it a lightning round?
Lightning round, please.
OK, lightning round.
The last of the hemispheric rhyming is hemispheric chews.
Name your favorite restaurant or eatery.
Go for it.
Oh, I thought it was favorite type of food.
I didn't know it was actually a specific restaurant.
You can do whatever floats your boat.
Sushi, burritos, pizza.
In that order.
Yes. Best sushi ever in my entire life was sushi Iwa in Kyoto, Japan.
Yeah. Best overall food related experience of my entire existence.
Andrew, what's your hemispheric chew?
Mine is from the Dolly Parton theme park.
I think it was.
What's it?
Dream, Dream World, Dreamland, what's the name of her theme park?
Dollywood.
Dreammore.
Dollywood's Dreammore.
I know it's only open from nine to five.
Dollywood's Dreammore Resort in Pigeon Forge.
Okay.
What?
Keep going.
Go ahead.
They have a little outlet there that sells, makes on site and sells this like cinnamon bread.
I want to call it.
When you buy it, it comes hot. It's so sugary and so light that it basically dissolves in your mouth. It's like a loaf, but it just disappears. And it is the most delicious thing you could ever imagine.
I also assume it's probably loaded with like fats. And if you ate too much of it, you would end up the size of a house. But it is to die for.
I am ready to go back to Pigeon Forge just to eat that cinnamon bread.
You can't find it anywhere else.
It's just in the theme park.
Wow.
So you have to visit Dolly Parton to get your favourite food.
Yes.
Wow.
If only she was there.
I just want to give five one prime plus bonus points to anyone that ever thought that Dollywood would make an appearance on the show.
We got that.
That one, that's the long bet.
and if you took it, it's going off now.
(laughing)
Gotta say, took us 50 to get here, but here we are.
Eating cinnamon bread at Dollywood.
- Well, to finish the lightning round of hemispheric chews,
our favorite restaurant, Natasha and I share this,
is a place called Centro CBD, or just Centro for short.
And if you're really Italian, centro,
I suppose that's how you're supposed to say it.
It's an Italian restaurant in Wollongong
where we have had many different family events
and just, you know, nice dinners out over the years.
I love it, not just because their Italian food is excellent, but because it's the perfect
balance of service.
You know when you go somewhere fancy and you dress up for it, but they're constantly waiting
on you and you've just put that mouthful in your mouth, that fork is in between your lips
and they say, "How's the food?"
And then you have to splutter with a mouthful.
They always time it.
They're never over the top.
They have this picture of Venice there and there's this little table for two under what
appears to be a spotlight from the ceiling.
Natasha and I were seated there one night
when we had a table for two,
and then people we knew from the family came in
and just laughed at us because they'd positioned us
in this like lady in the tramp thing
under the spotlight in front of this picture of Venice.
So I thought, are they trolling us?
So I think they have a sense of humor.
- Did you do the spaghetti thing?
- We love the place.
Oh, I don't recall if we did it that night
because we didn't actually have spaghetti,
but on other occasions, yes, it has been practiced.
- Have you done the spaghetti thing?
- Not at a restaurant, I think, but yeah, we've tried it.
- Oh, all right.
I've just sent a link to the cinnamon bread in the chat.
- Perfect.
- Please, we all need some Dollywood in our lives.
- Yeah. - Really important.
You need to click that and see, witness the greatness.
- Oh man, this bread, holy crap.
This bread looks horrifying.
This looks like if you ate that,
you would be very close to death.
- It looks a bit like chicken.
- So I didn't wanna say it
'cause I didn't wanna like ruin your-
- That's not how I remember it.
- But it does look like a piece of meat in a tray.
And that's not actually exactly how I remember it so it's a I remember it's the flavor you gotta leave it
Just got a pic. We'll go with your memory of it versus what we're seeing here
I think we'll do you're only a few hours away from Tennessee. You could get there a few yeah road trip hamster
Yeah a few hours away probably
Let's see Wow
Could you do it by next show I mean?
If I wanted to I could directions getting directions from my location
Oh, that's so close. So if your definition of a few hours is
one day and 12 hours
Then yes, that's a few
95
It's just a few hours. Oh, and there's a severe weather warning. So that might be a little longer
Yeah, wait to summer wait to summer. Okay, I'll do that. Yeah, I'll maybe by episode
73 I'll meet you there. So
Okay, it's a it's a few more hours for you than it is me
Hmm long way to go for a piece of bread with sugar on it. It's worth it
It's worth the the 86 hours of plane flights and transfers
All right, atmospheric choose. Thank you for indulging me on that one man. No, I was happy to reinsert it
it's alright how would we have known about Dollywood in the bread otherwise
true I think he was aching to reveal it's like what you have for breakfast
this morning well what I didn't have was my favorite food which is from Dollywood
fun fact have you heard of Dollywood no Jollywood to be fair sneaky good it's
got about 10 roller coasters it's got some really good shows like hold on let
me just turn down my radio playing Dolly Parton speaking of Dolly Parton did you
know that there's a Dollywood and they have this bread there out of this world.
Actually, now that we're on the topic of Dolly Parton, Andrew, how do you feel about Whitney
Houston's cover of her song for the Bodyguard?
Do you prefer Dolly Parton's original version of And I Will Always Love You?
I think I do.
I think Whitney Houston's is a bit overblown.
Yeah, some of those high notes, impressive, but overblown.
And right back into the Matrix discussion again.
How you guys are going to fight about that?
I have it on good authority Martin is definitely on the other side of that argument I think so
Big Whitney Houston fan. I think I think it's actually really a cover for the fact that he
really doesn't like Kevin Costner. What do you have against Kevin Costner? Is it is it water
world? Is that the issue? Kevin Costner. Oh water world. Yes. That's the one with the dirt.
Yep. Yeah. At least a rare piece of dirt. Yeah. The worst maybe. Which funnily enough is not on
the highest point of planet earth. There's way worse movies than that I have to say.
I agree.
But it sure has made a great theme park attraction over many, many years.
I think that's made more money than the movie.
I enjoyed it.
I'm just looking at satellite imagery of Dollywood now.
Obviously.
Yeah.
Is anybody have a loaf of bread?
Do we have that kind of resolution yet?
I'm literally trying to look back at where that bread was.
Yeah.
We'll insert the GPS coordinates of the bread stand.
What a lightning round this is.
Yeah, really fast.
Lightning's the slow one, right?
Real slow.
Yeah, when you put a slow-mo effect on it, it can be very slow.
Do you know, in other Dollywood news, they had a lot of old people working on the attractions,
which is not something you usually see at a theme park, and they were lovely.
They had a lot more patience.
And I just read the other day that-
Were they also radio presenters?
They weren't, but they were definitely my people.
Apparently, Dollywood is now supporting anybody in her employ in those parks and things can get,
she will pay for education and tuition for them to better themselves.
Wow.
Any other...
Your move, Disney.
Dollywood facts that we can...
Nah, that'll do.
...cover?
Can I just say, Andrew, have you applied to be on ABC's television show Hard Quiz as a Dolly
It feels like that would be...
I choose basketball and Dolly Parton.
Together.
And 1990s WWE wrestling.
You are an eclectic man, Andrew.
I think there's a lot of overlap between those three things.
I bet you'll find that diagram's pretty tight, I would think.
She was doing both in the 90s.
Yeah, actually I think Dolly might have been in WWE at one point.
Surely, then Marshy must have been.
Just, whoo.
One of the divas.
Just checking real quick.
Any other Dolly news that we need to...
I think I'm good.
I went to a concert.
I think I've been to two of them.
Remember when he's like, I'm done and then he kept going.
It's really good.
His brain just catches up to the state.
Now I want to start singing Blue Smoke.
Climbing up the mountain.
Oh my God.
Finish it.
Keep going.
Start again.
No, he can't.
He could, but he can't because we don't want to get a copyright thing.
So other than that, it would be fine.
But you know, I'm just looking out for the-
Maybe if he just sings the lyrics of Spoonerisms and swaps the first letters of each word, we can get by.
So Andrew, can you just take a line from that song, but swap the letters?
No.
So what's our next topic?
Do you know Dolly has a song called The Grass is Blue, which is basically a whole song of spoonerisms.
Christ.
And she's trying to, trying to say that she doesn't love a man, but she actually does.
Yeah.
Mountains are low.
We've started dissecting the songs for their meaning now.
That's where we've come to.
Okay.
I'll stop.
I'll stop.
On this.
My idol, Hemispheric Muse.
I want to change my pick, right?
Dolly Parton.
Dolly Fartum.
Twice now he said he's done and you just kept going.
All right revised answer Dolly Parton is Andrews Hemispheric Muse.
We'll go back and somehow somehow work that in.
Can we do a special media corner?
Yep.
Absolutely.
Cue the music.
Music.
That music that music that we just heard was done by our very own Alex Canyon.
Dolly no no I like you said I like the way you said our do we do we do.
He's on retainer yeah can you have a can you have a musician on retainer is that a thing I think musicians take money anyway they can get it.
Okay retainer.
So Alex as well as doing theme music for podcast such as ours he is in a band called Voyager.
Voyager next week are on Eurovision Australia decides.
This is the time that's so cool anybody who's in Australia and anybody who can VPN into Australia needs to find a way to vote next week.
For Voyager to get to Eurovision.
If you don't like the music we don't care you like this podcast you listen to it you support Alex and the media corner theme tune what's more.
Is they have released a limited edition Voyager dreamer beer.
So awesome you can buy beer with the bands name on it.
It's on can do you have any yet i've preordered i should be picking it up.
I got a case it got a call a cube nice craft beers it's over confusing used to get just slabs.
Slab of beer is 24 cans and that was easy but now this cubes if you wanna buy a cube of beer which i've done how many do you get in a cube you 16.
Is it actually a cube? I'm hoping so.
Okay.
And it seems like 16 divides into a cubic shape, right?
Should.
So I'm excited that it is actually going to be a cube. I'll report back on that.
How long is it? Is it a limited run?
I believe, yes, it is a limited run. So I've gone full fanboy. I love the song.
There is on YouTube also, not only the song itself that you can listen to and enjoy,
There is a their renditions focusing on each of the band members playing their part of the song dreamer
Yes, this is the Eurovision Song Contest song. It's really good and
I've bought a t-shirt and
I have now bought the beer so I am full fanboying over this song. It's really good
I think you like it too, but you know who is also fanboying
Alex is fanboying over hemispheric views because you did you see the sticker the other day the photo?
Oh, I saw it.
I did.
Oh, I saw it.
Yeah.
We have got-
On his own mayonnaise guitar.
A Hemispheric View sticker on a mayonnaise guitar.
Boys, we're going to Eurovision.
Going to be that right there, front and center, and they're going to be like, "Wow, they did
so good, and look at that sticker."
Does he still get mad when you call it a mayonnaise guitar?
I think he's resigned to the fact at this point.
I think we've worn him out.
Okay.
At first it was, no, no, no, it's not mayonnaise, it's mayonnaise.
Yeah.
Yeah, so he said, yeah, mayonnaise.
And I guess also, technically, I guess it would be a bass guitar.
Is that accurate?
So you're kind of doing it wrong twice, which just makes it--
You shouldn't call it a guitar.
It should be a-- should I call it a bass?
Is that just what the musos call it, just a bass?
Mayonnaise bass?
I don't know.
Or a bass guitar?
I don't know.
We're going to have to check with the-- oh, I hope they're not playing outside in the
sun.
That could be bad.
So Media Corner, Eurovision decides, Eurovision colon Australia decides, it's next weekend,
it's at 5.30 next Saturday night, I think my time.
Do the math or just Google it.
Just search Eurovision online.
Duck, duck, go it.
Work it out yourself.
And the point is...
Because you're not saving trees anymore, are you Andrew?
No, I'm not doing the Ecosia thing.
You gave up on that.
Don't like it.
No, we're back to saving trees.
We're searching through reddit. That's the thing we do now actually we read it is the new search engine
Wait, what when did that happen? Do you guys not hear about that?
No, that's a big thing Andrew read it somewhere. I see you did there
No, because everybody's complaining now that Google is useless, which it is. It's full of SEO spam garbage
You can never get a real answer
So if you want to get a real answer from a real person now you you you put the term into your search engine of
your choice but then you either just put reddit at the end or you do the site
colon reddit.com and that gives you an answer that has some level of validity
because some nerd has typed it into reddit yeah and it gets you bypasses all
the SEO stuff. All right so I'm starting a new segment on hemispheric
views and it's Andrew recommends is that your first Andrew recommends of the week?
I think it is. I feel like it's not mine though I feel I'm stealing it from somebody else.
You're recommending it.
I'll fair enough then it's like if you said I recommend you put mayonnaise on a sandwich when I'm saying Andrew you claim that you invented my nose.
Good point okay then I like this topic I'm all for it so yes my recommendation is this recommendation slash challenge everybody this week whenever you do a search in your search engine of choice.
Add the word reddit to the end I eat it.
Are you ready space I T.
You ready to hear first what hurt it just do it just do it and say and just honestly call it doesn't matter what you're searching for after that doesn't matter you can't say just do it no that's that one you can actually that is stealing.
Andrew recommends just do it yeah it's in the game trademark.
