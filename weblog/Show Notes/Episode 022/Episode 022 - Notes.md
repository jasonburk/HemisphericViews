Now things are really getting serious (and also kinda silly). Jason steps fully into his role as HR OVERLORD and gives Andrew and Martin a set of performance reviews that they will never forget. Following that, they discuss the market power of Amazon, then give their latest Media Corner picks and finally, things get a bit weird as a big pickle jar is opened.
