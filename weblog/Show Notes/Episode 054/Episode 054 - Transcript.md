Hi, I'm Andrew.
And I'm Jason.
And I'm Martin.
This is Hemispheric Views.
[Music]
Zoom's gone laggy.
[Laughter]
Yeah.
Really?
Not for me.
Video yeah, or as soon as I push record on audio hijack 4.0 point one. Oh
I think it's only
Made for m1 computers. It feels like it at this point
It's interesting looking now that orange is like I'm loving it. It's all over the place. It's huge. Lots of orange
I love the other curvy lines rather than those straight lines that were I never liked straight lines. I always want to yeah
humanistic curve to my lines.
- They were straight lines before, that's a good point.
Well, hopefully this is actually recording
'cause I didn't have, no one tested it.
We just blindly upgraded and we're hoping for the best.
- I was gonna say to everyone in the audience,
welcome to the Rogue Amoeba Show
'cause it's become the Audio Hijack podcast.
- Yeah, I mean, I just hope that whoever is listening
to this right now, they're getting like all of the audio
from like the left ear only or something.
This is part of our growth strategy.
So now we have a reason to tag in Rogamiiba,
Paul Kifasas, fans and we're customers of theirs.
- Well, I just wanna say that I would have upgraded
and spent the exact same money if it were only the icon.
'Cause I love the little,
I like the fact that they've respected the squircle
or the round rec,
but put in that little slightly diagonal microphone,
it feels like it's bridged both sides
the Mac design timeline. I haven't come around on it yet. I'm still in mourning for my little
jar of honey. I never liked that jar. But the one thing about this is the icon reminds
me too much of dark mode. I'm running in light mode, of course, the only correct mode. I
would like the icon to be a light mode icon as well. It's like they knew the correct icon
to use for the correct type of... Well, I'm sure in 4.1 there'll be the Andrew Canyon
icon. Probably. That would be amazing. I would like that in release notes. And I hope they've
bring back the jar of honey too. I mean, I have to, I don't know if you've ever really
thought about it, but the little jar of honey, I always took that to represent that the liquid
goo in the jar is what you use to like paste between the blocks. Do you think that's accurate?
It's a nice interpretation. I'm not sure if that was their intention. I think we can just
assume I think safely that that's correct. So the reason we had to start recording now and then talk
about this is because I asked Martin a simple straightforward question. I said Martin you're
all clean shaven you're looking very baby face today and rather than give an answer he said
we'd best start recording so there's got to be something more to this. Here we go.
So so Martin what's with the face? Well I hadn't planned this but you're right Andrew you asked
the question. I don't like shaving every day. I find it annoying, both in terms of time and routine
and the fact that it irritates me. No matter how many times Gillette tries to tell me, "Oh,
this seven blade technology with eight to come is not going to irritate me."
You got to get the nine blade. Yeah, that's the issue.
See, you just never end it. And suddenly we're double digits and goodness knows.
We tried this new 46 blade operation. It's amazing.
Anyway, the answer is that I don't like shaving every day, so generally I let the beard grow
out a little bit or I use the electric shaver and kind of, or like the clippers and maintain it a bit.
But although I had been maintaining the neck recently and done that little line,
it had gotten to the point that it was so spiky that Natasha said, "It hurts when you kiss me now."
And not just emotionally.
The problem is not so much just that it's spiky, but you're very enthusiastic. So I'm
essentially like attacking my wife with kisses with like this really spiky lip region and you
know I started to feel sorry for her so that's why I shaved and have this baby face look today.
Well there you go Martin. Martin felt obviously desperate for some affection.
Well I just don't want to hurt my spouse but yes do either of you have that issue because you're both
you know carrying facial hair at the moment. I've gone the other way and I've just decided
to keep on growing it. My beard is now getting pretty long.
Yeah, he's like a big soft bear now.
He's passed over into the just kind of squishy bear phase.
I'm just growing everything at the moment.
I'm growing my beard out.
I'm growing my hair.
Like I'm trying to be, I think it's a midlife crisis, actually.
Can I ask you, Andrew, are you trying to bring the bush ranger back to Western
Australia?
I'm just trying to fit in.
Have you seen Western Australian people these days?
Beards and mullets all over the place.
Can I give you a suggestion on how to fit in with Western Australian folk?
High-vis vests.
That would help me fit in.
Absolutely.
High-vis, the uniform of choice.
I, I've been in somewhat of a high-vis rabbit hole, um, of late, thanks to someone
on the other side over there in the gong, Martin Feld, in his work videos.
And the latest one had a gentleman wearing a high-vis vest with, I believe, a built-in collar,
had a monogrammed name on it. And my question to him was, "A, when I go on the tour of your
work establishment and I'm allowed to do whatever I want, as we've previously agreed upon, can I
purchase one of these high-vis vests and get my name embroidered while I'm there as my going away
present. He was a little bit evasive to that question, but he did let me know that if I
happened upon Western Australia that high-vis is all the rage there. So I think maybe that's what
you're missing. Maybe the facial hair and hair-hair is not the issue, it's the lack of high-vis.
Is this true, Andrew, that Western Australia has its state dress or costume as high-vis?
It is. It is. You'll see people, they wear it for work, but then they wear it for pleasure too.
You go down to the shopping centre and you'll just see people wandering around in their
high-vis wear, just because it's a Saturday and why wouldn't you?
Best to be safe.
Is it combined with the very controversial outdoor Ugg boot at Bunnings?
I think it's safer to wear high-vis.
If you're off-shift, I think it's better to wear high-vis with thongs, because you don't
want to overdo the safety levels.
Yeah, I mean, provided you're not on an industrial site or somewhere where that's a risk, and
you've thought of it.
I feel like a reverse OSHA situation there where there's like a health and safety thing but it's like the reverse like you're too safe now and now that's become a problem.
That is the weekend yeah because dangerous things only ever happen on the work site during the during working hours.
9 to 5.
You go home.
Yeah.
No nothing bad happens.
You go home and you go to do your lawn mowing and clean your gutters it's fine nothing's gonna go wrong there you're on your home.
Yeah blades near toes who cares.
Hi-vis in WA is it's passion it's a way of life.
So you said pleasure first you've said passion this is going in a really weird direction.
I love it, you can just pick it up you wear it it's almost like you know in some some places people wear sports uniforms you know so they support their local football team so they'll go out.
They'll wear their football team. Well in WA you're either
It's like that, but you're either a woodside person or you're a BHP person
Or you're a Rio Tinto person. So you wear the appropriate high vis with the logos to say hey, look at me
This is my team if you go to Perth Airport, so this is when they are going to work
So they are in requisite high vis wear is blinding
You need to wear sunglasses in the airport because of all the high vis and they've got the reflective stripes on them as well
So not only is it bright yellow or orange or whatever the case may be, then it has the reflective
straps on. So don't flash a torch. I love that for flash photography. That's really helpful.
Yeah, don't torch a flash photography.
Do you think that's part of what they're trying to do? Is this like an identity protection measure?
Where if you try to take their picture, the picture is ruined because it just flashes right back at them.
But to your question Jason, this is the important one. You asked whether you'd be able to pick up your own
Embroidered name embroidered safety vest.
No, you would get the dreaded guest vest.
Oh, no, that's the one that's crumbled up in the back of the locker.
It's been through that 349 never washed.
Never been washed.
Not even one.
So I'm imagining he lands in Perth at the airport.
He's just been blinded by your really, really bright citizens.
And then he's given an unwashed guest vest.
Is that the state policy?
That's pretty much how it works.
We need you to do a rat test and put on the guest vest before you're allowed entry into the state.
And then it rhymes so they can make a song about it too.
It's like going to Hawaii but just not quite as glamorous where you'd get the lei there, nice flowers.
This is like that but an ugly, smelly, gross vest.
So am I correct in saying that you're actually welcomed with an official state song which goes something like
like see my vest, see my vest crumpled
'cause our washing's not the best.
- Man, copyright that.
- Wow, that was really impressive.
- Sell that.
- But then it's important, Jason,
after your two weeks in Western Australia.
- Wait a second, you said after my two weeks.
Is there like a mandatory,
am I gonna be held against my will for two weeks?
Is that what's going on here?
- No, no, no, you can enjoy your time in Western Australia
with the guest vest,
but you need to make sure when you depart our state,
find state, bring the guest vest with you and throw it back in the box for the next person coming in.
And it probably is says guest on it in giant ugly font too, just to really shame you.
Yeah. Perfect.
With bad kerning.
And like part of the letter is peeling off.
And the velcro, it'll be a size too small. So you have to like,
tight, close it tight, but then the velcro will be a bit worn out and sort of peeling.
So it won't ever quite stick together properly.
So no, there's no way you can get your own one.
I am sold, first of all.
This two weeks of being held against my will in Western Australia sounds great.
Am I ever allowed to take the vest off?
I'm assuming the answer is no.
I wouldn't.
Yeah, okay.
I thought that would be best practice.
Okay, this is good.
This is good for my travel journal.
In the United States, high-vis, is that even a phrase that you're familiar with?
He said hi vis yeah, I mean if you're around a place that would actually warrant wearing it like a some kind of
industrial facility
Yeah, anywhere where there's big giant things that are gonna probably kill you and you call it hi vis
Is that what is that the terminology or is it safety gown? No, I feel like hi vis is probably
Safety gown. No, I don't think that's a thing
probably. Maybe. I don't know, but I don't think so. All right, Martin, less hi-vis over
on your coast?
Oh, I'd say it matches what you were saying about industrial areas, or if you're in some
sort of tradesperson position or something. It's not a form of state or national dresses
Western Australia has apparently.
So this leads me to the logical question of why is there not a Perth bandits hi-vis set?
that I've seen. I believe that has actually been made. I believe it has. We'll have to
check in with Perth Bandits. We'll link it if it exists and if it doesn't, I think you
know what to do. Actually, you know what the Americans should
call a high-vis outfit? A Luxe Tux. Oh, that's classy.
Thank you. I like it.
And you can dress down to a safety gown. Safety gowns are more in the pleasure realm.
We like to save those for special occasions.
- Even if you're wearing a safety gown,
you don't wear ridiculous stiletto shoes
or anything like that.
You still need to wear steel cap boots.
- Oh, always, yeah.
You don't wanna be doing any kind of manual operations
without steel toe boots.
- Good, so yeah, Perth, home of the hive is.
Does that answer your question?
I hope it does.
- I have mostly forgotten what my question actually was,
but I believe you have answered it.
- Situation resolved.
Either way, we're done with it, I think.
Yeah, we can check that off right there.
Shut it down.
Don't actually stop recording though.
We're not done yet.
(upbeat music)
- Onto a topic that is very similarly related to HiViz,
the whole world of HiViz.
Jason, you got a new MacBook Pro?
- Yes.
It was either gonna be silver, space gray or HiViz.
I obviously went with HiViz.
Paid $100 more for it.
It's like the black, like the black book back in the day.
Yeah, exactly.
But you can't lose it.
It's like, it cannot be lost.
You thought air tags were great.
No.
Hi-vis MacBook can't be lost.
It's fantastic.
Is that why it's not on the site?
Cause it can't actually be photographed.
It just, there's no way to do.
Yeah, you can't.
Even when you walk in the store, there's just, is there a sun in the corner?
Because I can't even approach it.
Yeah.
So from what I've seen of it or been able to see, cause I have one of those like big
Welder helmets they put on whenever I use it.
Oh, I wish our prime minister knew how to use those.
What's that welding helmets?
Yeah, he did.
He did a high-vis tour and he did some welding our prime minister.
So, yeah, the leader of our country.
You know how they've got like a very dark shading over them to protect your
eyes for good reason.
That makes that that obviously made a little hard for him to aim the welding
the welding rod when he started.
So he lifted the visor and then hit the go button.
Yeah, during operation.
No, no, you're not going to want to do that.
Was he harmed?
Unfortunately, it seemed like he made it through.
Okay, because that seems like you could go blind basically instantly, I would think.
That's one of those things where you watch welding, you watch it on TV and you just see
your OLED screen go to 150% white in that area because it just can't handle it.
I think I learned that lesson about welding masks when I was about nine.
It's a little bit surprising that the Prime Minister of a country hasn't quite figured
that one out yet.
Is this like some kind of Western Australian child labour?
What was that about?
It's the high-vis induction process.
To get your high-vis vest, you've got to understand welding.
It all makes sense in the end.
It's part of the curriculum.
Actually this brings up a point that I want to put in briefly.
I don't know if this is a thing in the US, but Andrew, surely you'll relate.
Maybe to the English speaking countries, but why is it that when we're kids, and I'm talking
about boys, you get to be called master and then you graduate to mister?
It's the wrong way around.
I was always disappointed to have lost master.
That's a good point.
Because it sounds fancier.
Yeah, we don't do that at all.
I know it actually goes around saying, "Hello, Masterfeld."
It's not a thing, right?
If you get something in the mail, you know, your grandma might have addressed it to Master
Martin Feld.
That sounds awesome.
It's like Master Feld, Master Canyon, Master Burke.
And you're like, "Mister."
It just loses all grandeur.
No, we don't do that at all.
That's a great upgrade idea, Martin.
Let's see if we can get that done.
Thank you.
Should be the other way around.
It's like this vestige of the Commonwealth.
It's one good thing that we have as a result.
You can choose your own pronouns now.
So surely we can choose our own salutation.
What's a... what is that called? That thing that you put before your name?
Outdated?
Prefix. Can I choose a suffix while I'm at it?
Could you be Andrew Canyon BK, Basketball King or something like that?
No, it's too much like Burger King.
Oh, or Cindy Kings.
Oh gosh, don't even get me started on those guys.
[Music]
Went to the movies last night and wondered if we could run a cinema ad for Hemispheric
Views.
I bet those are real cheap right now.
That's the thing that got me thinking because the very first ad was for this organization Cine ads
And it was like get your local business on the big screen. I'm like, well if they're doing that it's got to be pretty cheap
Yeah, but they've done it for years. I remember since I was a kid
It's like Val Morgan cinema advertising delivers results and I'm like you're telling me to it's you're filling space with this
What yeah, you're telling me this is so effective. No one bought it. So you're telling us to buy it. Got it
Well, the only ads that they ran during this movie were ones for the Australian government
With and with a federal election knocking on the door, obviously, they've boosted their ad spend
So you've got ads by an ad
You know exhorting you to advertise and then ads from the federal government that they've obviously overcharged for because they can get away with it
So I think the hemispheric views I would love to see a cinema ad with hemispheric views. Can you imagine it?
I can I actually can and I love everything about it already especially
now that there is hemispheric views dot a you can't get more local than that
like get get on our level like how much more local business do you want than
that with an American voice try to can try to contest just Jason Burks voice
saying finally the Australian podcast that you've been wanting my horrible
voice and they're like, oh yeah, we could relate to this Australian business.
They're like, what the f*** is this guy?
Well, what we could do, we could do what they do with international ads or US ads.
I don't know, Andrew, you've surely seen this where it's like an ad for Finnish
dishwashing tablets or something.
And there's obviously an American mother or family member.
And you can see the over pronunciation of all of their mouth movements.
And they've just put this, gee, this is a great tablet over the top of it, but it does
not match. So what we're going to do, we're going to get Jason on video.
And Andrew you're gonna actually do like dubbing and we'll see if it lines. Oh, there we go
Yeah, it'll just be my vet my mouth moving saying like good day mate
See look at that nailed it nailed it
This is gonna imagine that they could envisage. Oh, man. Watch out movie
Even the fact that he said theaters perfect
Can I tell you about the worst kind of ad ever made on the planet sure
dynamically
inserted
podcast ads I'd believe that
so
Recently as recent as a few days ago
Mm-hmm open up my pocket casts digging through my my inbox seeing what's what's gonna be listened to today
Pick a show let it roll
Skip the beginning obviously there's a bunch of crap. I don't care about and then the show's going and then there's the mid ad
Which I usually I'll skip but sometimes I'm busy in
Things happen. That's fine. And I get an ad and I'm not gonna mention it because
literally fuck them
but it's an ad for
some kind of tobacco
not tobacco some kind of
nicotine Wow
product and
And I'm thinking like, oh, this is gonna be some kind of like
stop smoking like product that's gonna be not tobacco,
but you know, help you wean yourself off nicotine
or whatever, cool.
No, no, no, this was like, hey, do you wanna be like cool
and like hyped up, like get this nicotine thing.
And then like, we've got two different ones
for if you wanna just like be a little bit
or if you wanna like really just go wild,
like have the one that's like this many milligrams.
It was literally just a jack yourself up on nicotine product,
which I was like, Hey, how's that thing? Like, have you heard of cigarettes?
Like they're available. Go for it. Not condoning smoking.
Um, but yeah, so like that was the ad and I was like,
it just brought all these thoughts into my head immediately. Like, Hey,
is this where we're at now with podcasts? Have we gone that far? Cause like,
I don't even think you could show that on TV or any radio.
I don't imagine that would be legal.
- Mm, yeah, it's probably unregulated.
- But because it's podcasts,
I assume it's like do whatever you want,
Wild West, it doesn't matter.
So I was pissed that it was a dumb ad
that I don't care about.
I was pissed that it's an ad that is for something
that's objectionable, or I should say is horrible.
There's no redeeming thing there at all.
And just the fact that I have to imagine the podcast people,
they don't even know that this is happening.
They picked up some service
that is gonna dynamically insert ads
for your maximized revenue.
And they don't know what's gonna be in there.
They probably got like three check boxes
to say like what kind of ads they want,
which are super ambiguous and bullshit, I'm sure.
And now they're pumping out these ads for nicotine products
after they've spent what I hope would be time
and effort and love like crafting this show
to then just be kind of smeared with this ad.
And I just, I don't know,
they really kind of gave me this weird thing
about podcasting.
Like, I'm not gonna be all like,
oh, podcasting is over, it's not the good old days
whatever, but it's just something bad is happening. And I'm not sure that people even are aware of it.
Well, I have thoughts on this. And I think you've hit on a great point about
the status of podcasting or how successful it is, or the reach that it has, however you want to put
it. Oh, I've got Mr. Podcast right here. Of course.
He's done the research. Yeah.
He's probably got a chapter in his- Yeah, in the middle of it.
Yeah, there you go. Take it away.
So if you look at people in podcast studies, and when I say that, I mean an actual, you know,
somewhat fledgling or growing discipline in academia, right? It's called podcast studies.
All different people studying different genres, formats, whatever, they would tell you that
podcasting has been around for a while, but it really went mainstream in 2014 with the release
of Serial coinciding incidentally with the addition of podcasts as a separate app.
That's the thing. And that's what all the thing.
Podcasts were around way before that. I would say Adam Curry. Adam Curry is podcast commencement.
Yeah. No, no, they've been around for a good while, but in terms of mainstream or
like worldwide listenership, it really kicked off at the time that Apple added its own podcast app
and broke it out of music or the little iPod app. And when Serial, so they were not planned together.
They were kind of serendipitously or incidentally aligned, but that's when it happened.
Right? So podcasting has been a rich vein of creative activity well before that, but since then it's picked up more and more people have access. It's been a good thing.
But I think there's this real disconnect between creators and academics and researchers and people who just go and make this content and put it out, preferably on RSS, I would say.
That's the thing. There's this disconnect between them.
Yeah, and people who might be in the business area who then say, "Oh, podcasting hasn't gone big yet. It needs to be, you know, grown or boosted or made, you know, more accessible."
There's this kind of narrative that they have that podcasting hasn't reached its potential. But what they really mean is ad revenue or companies that make things more exclusive.
exclusive. So I think what you've hit on Jason is this perfect point that people just want to make
creative stuff they want to put out on a service that's accessible or cheap or whatever, reach as
many people as possible, but they don't necessarily know about this algorithmic stuff that ends up
compromising their show. Because not only are they having stuff put in there that is kind of morally
questionable or not what they would align themselves with, but it removes you from the
content, doesn't it? Oh, 100%. Yeah. And I think that's a global issue. Like you were saying,
there's this, everything has to be fricking 10x. We have to 10x everything. Everything's got to be
maximized. And we have to make, you know, having a living wage off of this is not enough. It's got
to be 80 billion, billion, billion dollars or whatever. So, so yes, the point of podcast hasn't
made it yet to your point is exactly that. It's not that it hasn't made it yet, whatever that
even means, or where does it even need to make it to? It's the fact that it hasn't made these five
people billionaires yet, so it's not made it, which is frustrating.
And you can imagine how it ruins the format because, separate from this, I volunteer for
a journal called Radio Doc Review, which is about podcasts or radio documentaries
that are really kind of narrative based or trying to talk about an issue. It could be historical,
whatever. It could be recent. I'm being very, very general here, but that's very different
from the kind of chatcast stuff that we're doing. And can you imagine if someone launched
a radio or podcast documentary on a service talking about really deep or meaningful or
ethical issues, something really personal, and then suddenly in the middle, there's a nicotine ad.
It's just wrong.
And I don't, I want to state very up front, I'm not trying to say like, oh, advert,
all advertising is bad and like anti advertising. Like I understand how the world works. Like
advertising has a place. But when you look at a lot of different shows, you can tell that there is a
a lot of thought and feeling put into them. And they do more of that kind of
more or less naturally inserted ads, you know, from, you know,
I use XYZ. I like it a lot. It does this for me. And by the way,
they're paying for this portion of the show, whatever. That's, that's fine.
And I can skip it. That's fine as well. Um,
but when it's this just egregious,
like hard punch in the face, stop to the show,
insert garbage. And then, Oh, by the way,
we have three ad spots, we only got one advertiser,
so now we're gonna play the same ad three times in a row
in that spot.
I've seen that happen too.
It's just like, why are you even,
are you even, at what point are you just gonna say,
let a robot make the whole show for me
'cause I don't even care?
And I feel like I'm attacking people at this point,
but I don't mean to be like super attacky about it,
but just this particular one was like,
you gotta really think about why you're doing this,
And if you're doing it to get the, what I assume would be eight cents from that nicotine ad,
because it's not like you're getting thousands of dollars for sponsoring this ad.
And let's just take the nicotine ad out of it altogether.
Just XYZ, rando, insert ad, those can't be worth close to anything.
So you're just scraping pennies.
And now at that point, it's like, why are we even really doing this?
No, I think what you say is fair.
And you're not having a go at them at all.
If people want to do podcast advertising, fantastic. Maybe they want to build a business
or connect with other people or whatever it is. But there is that point about something inserted
that you didn't choose that ends up destroying your own creative material versus I'm aware of
what's going into the show. And they change apparently. They change, which is also weird.
I heard from somebody on Microdot blog that like they went and redownloaded a show
from the past and because these things are being jammed in at the time,
the show has now changed. And now you're left in a position where what you talked about six months
ago, you don't know what's being advertised against that show now. And that's like a whole
different thing. Because it could be, like you said, maybe you're talking about something
very sensitive. And now all of a sudden, right after you make a point, there's an ad about the
the exact opposite and now the person listening is left with like, what the hell is this person
even doing?
Yeah, it's just a total clearing house.
It's like Google AdWords, you know, it's just who is willing to pay for insertion on that
day and date that it's downloaded.
I don't have many shows that I listen to that have those.
Maybe a couple, but they're not, I can get past them.
Most of the shows I listen to are nerdy enough that they do their own ad reads.
And they usually chapter mark them and all that kind of stuff, which is totally fine.
And so I don't have a huge problem.
I don't like them at all, but I'm also not exposed to them in a great way.
And I think that if I started to find podcasts that were having those, I think I'd unsubscribe.
I just don't think I could be bothered dealing with that because they are so annoying.
And then they usually have like a bumper.
The ones I've heard usually have like some sort of bumper sound effect that is a totally different level and usually much louder than the show itself.
So not only do you have the ad, you have a little "ping, poong, ping" before the ad, which blows your eardrums out.
That's just not worth it.
I think.
Yeah, because it's not leveled or part of the actual creative project.
Exactly.
It's just dumped in.
And like all advertising, you know, people have been complaining forever that ads on TV are always louder than the actual production.
And there's a whole argument. Well, it's just dynamic range.
Yeah. Well, whatever the perception is that it's louder and it's more annoying.
And so for that to happen in podcasting as well, super frustrating.
And the good thing is, I don't think we on Hemisphere Reviews are ever going to do that.
We will always do if we're going to do advertising for Big Banana or anything else, we're going to do it ourselves.
Big Banana. Perfect example.
Although it'd be interesting.
And I'd like to hear from listeners.
And this isn't homework. It's just a call.
I'd be interested to know because I think it's not a homework.
This is just a call for feedback or input.
Right. Because I think all three of us are saying ads aren't bad.
OK, if you want to do them and they help or you've been creative about it, go for it.
But if they do pop up and you don't expect them or they're wrong, that's not a good thing.
So my not homework for listeners is if you find hemispheric views somewhere on a podcast
player or service and a dynamically inserted ad is there, maybe because, you know, there's
this issue of scraping podcasts and putting them to services,
I'd love to know where they are.
Not to be angry, but just to know,
because we might not even be aware
that they're out there somewhere.
- Yeah, if I found out this show was being
randomly sponsored by like, I don't know, whatever,
I would be furious for sure.
That's just, that's not right.
And the other side is true as well,
where if you do an ad and you don't even tell people
it's an ad, that's also terrible.
So you have to like be in the correct lane for this stuff.
Bing bing bing.
Thanks for listening to Hemispheric Views.

You'll enjoy it.
It's worth it.
It's cheap.
Bing bing bing.
Well done.
Good dynamic insert there.
Now you have to change it in three years and go back and edit it to make sure that it's rotating.
Now, just quickly, because Jason, you were saying something about the dock and whether it should go at the bottom or the side and vertical space and all this stuff.
Yeah, Natasha's hiding behind me.
Natasha actually had a thought to share with you about the dock and she wants to know what you think.
The dock?
Share away.
When did I even talk about the dock?
Did I talk about the dock today?
Hello.
Your jacket has icon, dock icons all over it.
I can't hear anything.
Oh no.
Plug.
Yeah.
Are you there?
Yes.
Hello.
Hello.
No, nothing's playing.
Oh, push the button.
Who's just playing?
I can't hear anything.
Oh, bloody hell.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
They were speaking and I couldn't.
Hello.
Try again.
I'm talking to you.
They like have to like fully be on your ears.
Yes.
Yes.
I know, what a pain.
What a design flaw.
Hello.
It's a good thing your lady bun is just behind the band there.
I know, imagine if it wasn't, you'd have to do a whole thing.
Sorry, I just hit the cord.
I was just gonna say it looks like your jacket you're wearing has Doc
Icons all over it.
What is going on? Oh, wow.
My little pom poms.
It's almost like you're doing one of those motion capture things like in a
movie, and they can like then turn you into a dinosaur or something.
- I haven't worn it since like last winter.
So I found all these pom poms in the pockets that fall off.
- Oh, I know what Max is gonna be doing.
He's just gonna be grab, grab, grab.
- Picking those off.
- Oh yeah, I've got to take it off when he wakes up
'cause I think he'll just destroy it.
- And then he'll try to eat them
and it'll be a whole thing.
- Absolutely.
- So what did I do wrong?
Martin said that you were saying I did something wrong.
- No, you haven't done anything wrong.
I just, oh, sorry, Marty.
I put my feet on his foot rest and he's--
- You're using him as a foot rest?
- No. - I would use, yeah.
That makes sense. - He's got a plastic foot rest
and it makes noise apparently on the recording.
- Oh, okay.
Is he just laying on the ground now or what does he--
- Look, get out. - Where did he go?
- They're wondering where you went.
- Hi. - Excuse me, I guess.
(laughing)
- I am the, I'm a teacher as I think you both know,
but I'm the IT administrator at school.
So people come to me with all of their tech problems,
just anything electrical.
So if a light's not working, they come to me.
(laughing)
- That sounds about right, yep.
- This lady disrupted me while I was eating lunch
and essentially something wasn't working
between the wifi and the internet set up
through the Department of Education.
The IT experts at the department are not Mac people,
They're PC people, so they blame the manufacturer
for everything. - Of course.
Always, it's always Apple's fault.
Oh, you're on an Apple.
- Yes, and they're like, "Ugh, it's a fault with the Mac."
- Ugh, always.
- No, you have a brand new computer.
There is nothing wrong with this machine,
except you're gonna have to bleep this.
Who's editing?
You would, Andrew.
(both laughing)
I (beep) hate a disappearing dock.
- Who does, why is that an option?
- Who does that?
- Who makes their doc disappear?
So I'm trying to like fix her problem
between Chrome and Safari,
and I don't know where it is
'cause it keeps (beep) disappearing.
So anyway, I just had to, I came home and I--
- She is in the wrong.
She is in the wrong, you are in the right.
- I turned it off, so I will, no, I reversed it.
So now her doc is there all the time.
It's like, if I have to help you,
I want it to look correct.
That's fair. That's perfectly valid.
That's all I wanted to say. I hate the disappearing dock.
I would ask you a follow-up question. Do you keep your dock on the bottom?
Yes, like a sane person.
Thank you. Yeah, exactly.
Because why would you put it anywhere else?
Because you're probably a serial killer, I would assume.
Yeah. Have you, you've tried yours on the right-hand side, haven't you?
I had mine on the left for the longest time, like more, for more than,
Definitely years, but I'm all I'm all back on the bottom now
But you like if it's down the bottom you can just move your cursor just along the bottom not up and down
Yeah, it's totally where it belongs. So that's that is as much validation as I needed. Yeah, that's all that's all
I wanted to say I hate the disappearing doc. Thank you
All right, would you like me to switch to Martin now not really if he's done being on the floor
- Or, oh no, me switched to being Martin,
then we can just continue the show.
- Oh, that's much better.
- Yeah.
(laughing)
- All right, oh no, I was gonna call you guys,
but he would never use that.
- No, he would call it.
- No, and he never says mate ever.
- What would he collectively call the two of you?
I don't even know.
- Some word that has at least 15 characters in it.
- My esteemed colleagues.
- Oh, yes, my esteemed colleagues,
so can we please talk about how Natasha
won't let me buy the studio display.
(laughing)
- Oh man.
- It will get rid of the flicker and all of my other issues.
- Can I tell you how perfect it is
that this is not his week to edit?
Like, could it be any more perfect?
I don't think so.
- The big question we have to ask you,
you've been watching Severance?
- Yes, oh, I'm so stressed.
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, I know.
- You're up to that then.
- Are you caught up now?
Are you up to the--
- Yeah, we watched episode eight last night.
- That was quite the ending.
- Managed to stay awake.
- Quite the ending.
- Martin almost fell off the lounge.
He was like, "No!"
- Jason, do you want, maybe you should tell Natasha
what we've got planned for our audience.
- Oh, yes.
So.
- An unboxing?
Did I say that on Discord?
- You did see that, absolutely.
- What is that?
- So, there was a promo item.
I don't know if it was like a crew gift or what.
I'm still unclear where this thing came from,
but it's effectively a, I don't know, a banker's box.
Does that mean anything to you all?
- You've lost your job.
You've lost your job and they've piled everything into it.
- If you were fired and they gave you
the little box with the handles.
- Oh, like a cardboard box with the handles.
- Yeah, yeah.
So it's basically one of those that's Severance themed
and it's just full of like severance stuff.
So it's got like the snacks that are in the vending machine,
a pen, like a pen and like a coffee cup,
like all these--
- Finger trap?
- I don't know, I'm not sure, I haven't opened it yet.
- Oh, okay.
- This promo box went out to whoever the hell is like,
you know, important enough to Apple TV to get one of these.
I have procured one and we're gonna do a live unboxing
of this thing for everyone that is obsessed with Severance,
because if you couldn't tell,
our Discord has now become one thread off of another thing.
It's just Severance forever.
- Is this just gonna become a Severance podcast?
- I mean, it's this close.
- I'd actually maybe listen.
- Okay, wow.
Okay.
(laughing)
There you go, wow.
All right, perfect, love it.
Well, you'll be happy to know that we are gonna do also,
along with this unboxing,
So that's going to happen once the show is over,
we're going to do a live rewatch of the
entire season. And we're going to do one episode at a time.
So we're not asking people to stick around for like 50 hours or whatever,
but we're going to do is we're gonna take an episode,
watch 15 minutes, pause, discuss,
15 minutes discuss,
and we're going to do each episode kind of as one event per thing.
- It would actually be very good to go back and rewatch.
I like that idea because I think you have an idea
of what happens as the show goes on,
but I think there might be clues earlier on.
- There's so much we missed.
There has to be.
Every scene, I feel like you could pause it
and probably talk about it for an hour.
Just all the things that are going on in the background,
how things are tied together.
Yeah, so the rewatch is happening as well.
It is not an event in Discord yet,
but it will be episode by episode.
- And there's actually a friend of the show, Neat Nick,
who is in charge of many severance related activities.
- Oh yeah, I've seen all of that.
- He's got a severance, a complete severance discord.
We've got a thread, he's got an entire discord instance.
We're hoping that we can maybe do a bit of cross promotion
with that group of people as well.
Get them on board with our severance unboxing.
Spread the good word of Hemispheric Views at the same time.
(upbeat music)
I asked Martin to dress Mac the other day.
Normally I pick out an outfit,
but I said, "Can you please dress him?"
And he was like, "Okay."
And put him in a yellow top and blue pants.
Not orange 'cause the logo is yellow and blue.
- In honor of Big Banana.
- But he was wearing yellow and blue.
So he was like, "Hemispheric views, baby."
- Yellow.
- I'm really sorry it's yellow.
- Remember when Natasha and I were like
really tightly aligned on things?
- It's yellow.
- Just 10 minutes ago. - She's correct.
- See, I think, Holland, hold up your watch band.
Oh, what color is, is that like a watermelon-y color?
- It's like a orange-y coral kind of color.
- Coral.
- I love the way Jason says coral.
- Coral. - Yeah, I love it.
- It's like you're singing a song.
- Coral.
- You say it with like an A, right?
You say like carl.
- No, that's U.
- Carl.
- I say coral. - Coral.
What do you say?
- Coral.
- Go, Andrew.
- Coral.
- Coral.
You just squished the whole thing into like three letters.
- How do you say, okay, you know the man's name, C-A-R-L?
- That's what it sounds like Jason's saying.
- Carl.
- Carl.
- No, that's Carl.
This is coral.
(laughing)
- You said the same word twice.
(laughing)
- That's what you guys do so much.
- You always think you're saying things differently
and that it's the same thing.
There's some weird thing happening with our brains.
- So that's what I was saying, sorry.
I live a hemispheric fuse life, so I feel like I,
and Martin does play back as he's editing,
he does play back a lot of the bits to me, so.
- Oh man, I'm sorry.
That's unfortunate.
- It's okay.
I just feel like I live with the two of you.
It's quite nice.
- I don't know, that doesn't seem good.
(laughing)
I feel bad now.
I feel like I'm not contributing to this relationship at all.
That's okay. I'll give you back to the real Martin Feld.
It's been a lovely interlude. You have a very,
you have a very lovely voice for podcasting.
Thank you for having me. I just got home with my sister,
so I should probably go back and see her.
Well, hello to your sister. What's her name?
Is she still here? Her name's Adriana.
Adriana, make sure you listen to the show.
Make sure you subscribe and follow and become a one prime plus subscriber as
- Well, I'll tell her.
- Has she heard the good word of oneprimeplus.com?
Probably should tell her about it.
- No, I don't know.
Have you spoken to Donna about the podcast?
- Not the podcast, the good word about oneprimeplus.
- oneprimeplus.com.
- All right, Feldfoot is back.
I'll hand you that.
- Hello Feldfoot.
- I have a foot phobia, so it's just.
(laughing)
- We all do.
- That is the most unfortunate thing ever, yeah.
All right.
Nice to talk to you.
If you got a foot like that walking around, you got to be, you got to have a phobia of some kind.
Don't even look at his toenails.
Oh, I would never.
Bye.
Oh, she loves that.
That was her favorite thing.
She loved that was like a true.
I just like that in the West.
Laugh at the end there.
She was like hardcore right there.
Yeah.
Oh, her laugh.
Yeah.
Well, thank you for having the not Martin on.
I don't know what she was saying.
Like, I'm the real Martin.
What is that?
Anyway, whatever.
No, we can't tell you what was said.
You'll have to hear it when it comes out.
Who's the real Slim Shady?
Please stand up.
Hello.
Hello, sir.
How are you?
How was the floor?
It was great.
Thank you.
Thanks for having her on.
Get your back all straightened out.
And yeah, it's good.
I thought she was just coming in to talk for two minutes about auto hiding the doc, but here we are.
I think we went about 25, 45 minutes, something like that.
I thought this might interfere with the topic pool too much.
She wanted to share something.
She was like, "Oh, Marnie, can you bring this up on the show?"
And I went, "Well, they should really hear from you.
It might be a nice two-minute surprise."
And here we are, I've been booted out as a co-host.
