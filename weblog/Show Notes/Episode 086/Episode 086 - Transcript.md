Music.
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Hemisphere Reviews episode 085 coming to you live from the studios of Perth Western Australia, Wollongong New South Wales and Portland Oregon.
We are excited to be here with you today. Jason has fixed all his technical audio issues.
So making the editing job of Martin Feldenwillenlong much easier this week, as opposed to Andrew
Kenyon last week, who had to suffer. But that's okay. Jason doesn't care because he just does
show notes.
That is it.
Now on with the show.
And I would also like to point out this is episode 86. So...
I said 85.
Yeah.
Oh, 85 was the little one.
Yeah.
I've already confused you.
And I love it.
That was like the most breathless, impressive intro ever.
And Jason's just going, "Ah, little finger.
Let me.
Ah."
Well done.
Yeah.
So we'll just put a robot voice over when you say that part.
We'll just dub in 86.
Well, Andrew's the soundboard now.
So I'm going to press the button.
That's true.
episode 86 on command press button episode 86 done it's flawless let me try
again take two fixed okay episode 086 there it is okay perfect solid take your
pick so how we kicking things off guys the stacks stacks and stacks of desktop
stacks desk don't know hop stacks do you use stacks have you use stacks now we're
- Are you talking about stacks that are groupings
of files and folders on the desktop itself
rather than the stacks that are in the dock?
- That is correct, yes.
Desktop file auto stacking,
I think is the technical term for it.
- So if you right click on your desktop,
you can say use stacks.
- That's the one.
- Yep.
- And if you're already using stacks,
you can right click on it and uncheck use stacks
and any icons on your desktop will stack.
Group stacks by kind shared by date less opened date added date modified date created or tags
Of which only one of those makes any sense to me. So which would be kind yes, not tag surprisingly
You'd think tags would have been the one or maybe more shared by because
That one really helpful for all of those files being shared to me
I'm just gonna get my answer out of the way. I think this is a great feature for those who want or need it
I started using it just to see what it was like when they first introduced it and just went this is great
But it's not really for me because I found that that collapsing into groups
Made things less visible and I keep my desktop fairly clean and minimalistic anyway, so I turned it off
Okay, Andrew. Yeah, I've tried it once or twice and I turn it off. It's just another click. I'm always gonna need something within somewhere. So I have to open this. First of all, think about what file format it might be.
might be then open the stack then find it and I like Martin I've only got
working files on my desktop they're there for maybe a day or two at best
most of the time and then they've been moosed off somewhere else so no value
for me no value for you is what he's saying okay well I'm finding value I'm
here to tell you there's value in there you just gotta you gotta see it and we're
still talking about desktop stacks not canyon.blog/save? No, no there are no
stacks in canyon.blog/save. I heard value and my mind just went straight there I'm
sorry. There's stacks of cash. If canyon.blog/save is actually online
I'm just gonna say there's been some outages recently and it's been
inaccessible so. I'm talking to the people in the data center told them it's
It's really not good enough.
So we should be up and running.
If it's not 100% uptime, you are the product.
That's all I'm going to say.
Anyway, back to Stacks.
I like Stacks.
I've been using Stacks for a few weeks and I find it to be quite nice how it puts everything
in little folders.
Not folders, really.
Kind of folders.
They're like hybrid folder thing.
Mock folders.
Mock folders.
I think it's great.
I think the thing I've liked most about it
is for screenshots, because it's smart enough
to separate images from screenshots.
And that always drives me nuts
when I'm doing a lot of screenshotting for some reason,
and then I'm looking like, which one, is it that one?
Is it that one?
No, that's an image of something I'm working on.
So it separates them.
I think that's really great.
The only thing that has bothered me about it so far
is there's two very important settings that it's missing.
and being that coming up soon is the developers conference,
they're gonna hear this and they're gonna put 'em in
to the next Mac OS.
So that's why I'm talking about it right now.
Number one is you should be able to rename
what a stack is called.
Videos are called movies.
They're not movies, they're videos.
So like, let's get that fixed, right?
Like I don't have a bunch of movies on my desktop.
If I did, fine, call 'em movies.
These aren't movies, these are videos.
Second, I would like an auto collapse,
if no activity, in X amount of time.
So I open up a stack, it's unfurled,
all the files are showing.
I don't come back to it for 30 seconds, a minute, an hour.
Just collapse that bad boy right back down.
Don't need it open, clearly I'm not doing anything in there,
so just shut it down.
That's it.
Those two things will make Stacks perfect for me.
So, Stacks.
- It's really interesting you say those things
because I reckon the reason Apple hasn't done this,
and this isn't making excuses,
this is just where my brain went.
- Classic Apple apologist.
- Yeah, that's right.
Fan boy with an I, number one speaking.
Do you reckon it's because you would call yourself
an enthusiast or a power user of the Mac, right Jason?
- Occasionally.
- Yeah, we'll put it that way generally.
- Yeah.
was probably introduced for people who aren't into as much organization of their computer.
I don't want to call them novices because that's maybe condescending, but people who are less
interested in that computery stuff. So it's almost like maybe Apple deliberately didn't
put in all this customization and power user settings of this thing, but that's actually
to its detriment because you need to be able to customize it to make it work properly or the way
way you want. Seems a bit weird, right?
I think you're spot on,
but I do feel like they're going to listen to this call and say, you know what?
We missed that one. We're going to get that in there for you.
I'm just getting an iMessage right now. Just a sec. Oh, that's from Hair Force One.
He said, heard Jason loud and clear. It's in the next release.
Oh, thank you. Perfect. Glad that got moved up. Thank goodness.
We're canceling Apple car to make sure we get stacks. Correct.
is what I'm hearing.
That's what I heard.
I've enabled stacks again.
OK.
And what I've also done is I've bumped up my icon size to maximum.
Maximum.
I've gone one hundred and one hundred and twenty eight by one twenty eight.
Right.
And I'm going to I'm going to try this.
Let's see how it goes. I'm going to do stacks with giant icons and see.
That's like stacks.
But then you have to make your dock the smallest it can be and put on maximum
magnification.
Oh boy.
That's nuts.
Can't go that far.
Hold on here. Let me, let me command J. Let me see here.
We're going down a tangent. We're going down a tangent hole. Okay.
Tangent corner. Martin, on your desktop. Yeah, command J it.
What is your icon size currently?
Alright, command J. Icon size 84 by 84.
With just under the middle grid spacing.
And text size 14. 14? Isn't that...
Label position bottom. Isnt that the best where whenever you're gonna tell somebody what these settings are you have to you get exact numbers exact numbers
And then kind of sort of a little bit to the right of the middle line on the left
*laughter*
drives me f***ing nuts
Just put a number for grid spacing is it one two three four five or six like what is the grid spacing now I have a number it's
Maddening. Yeah, oh very important snap to grid. Okay. I'm all about snap to grid. Where's that?
I don't have that I don't have a snap to grid that's a right-click option isn't it it's not in command J now Andrew
We were you bothered by my size 14 is that all right? Yeah was what's wrong with that?
It's snap to grid isn't in command J settings is it it is not agreed. I've forgotten you have stacks on
Yes, I think it cancels that there is no grid if you have stacks good point, okay, but there is good spacing
Yeah, yeah, what's wrong with size 14 14 is too big. Why do you need 14 point font on a new desktop?
I don't know it just looks nice to me. I'm changing my who it's beautiful now
I'm changing my under 14 as well all right 14 it is giant icons giant font went from total hater to
Advocate within three seconds because I say that's nice to me
I don't like it, but I'm gonna try. I'm just I like it. Have you ever have you ever tried label position, right?
It is I have it's disgusting
It feels wrong it feels like the kind of thing somebody would love if they put their dock on the side.
I put my dog on the side.
You're insane.
We discussed this before I have normally or mostly had it down the bottom but more recently it's like I've got all this space on the side and it just feels tucked away.
We can't get back into the corner okay.
This is okay.
Alright alright we're a skip evacuate evacuate everybody out everybody out get out of the building we're out of the building close your command J.
I'm doing my hemispheric hemispheriment hem hem mix your hemorrhoid element my hem experiment
you're pulling a hammy what are we doing here can you tell us what you're doing
it's my hair hem experiment okay of stacks okay i'll report back okay thank you
hem experiment that's all i got
Do any of you use folder view?
You're talking about like the grid of folders?
Yes.
Sometimes, but not as my default one, no.
Hang on, what do you mean grid of folders? What are we talking about?
Folder view.
Like in the finder.
Finder folders.
Like as icons, you mean? Like view as icons?
Yeah.
Okay, no. Only in applications.
Would you if it was your wallet?
So Jason you're holding up an actual wallet in the shape of a macOS folder.
So we're looking at one of those.
I saw this advertised online.
I did not buy one.
This showed up at my house.
Two of them did.
And turns out Valerie got these for us because she was like, I don't even know if we'll use these.
But they were too adorable not to have.
That is very cute.
So they're little, they're wallets.
I mean, they're like the kind of like minimalist wallet or whatever they're like where you couldn't put a couple of thingies in there
But it looks like the little blue finder
Folder and it is like the cutest little thing that you could have it is like Valerie's challenge to our everyday carry
Discussion that we think it must be I think it must just to see if Andrew buys one now
Now we've got little folders that have you can put little files in also
One there on the front one on the back and yeah it is a wallet that looks like.
Hey finder folder is called the untitled folder wallet by Nick Bentell.
I saw advertised online and I resisted the urge and now Jason has on then now the urges returned.
Of all things I resisted the urge which is unheard of and then they showed up in my house anyway.
Is it magsafe? I don't think so. Wouldn't be would it? I don't think so. No, it does not feel magsafe.
I just love that I have like a real world little folder that I can put files in.
So there you go. Rethink your thought about folder view. Wow, that's cool. That went in a
direction I wasn't expecting. That was the plan. Mission accomplished. So the message of that is
that he actually doesn't care how we use the folders. It was just to bring up the wallet.
No, couldn't, could not give any...
Column view is the one true way, to be fair.
[SIGH]
Um, next topic.
Again?
Can we talk about something else other than me?
Nah, you're on fire.
Off you go.
Next topic.
I want to tell you about a really cool thing that I purchased at an extraordinary deal,
Not from canyon.blog/save that I returned the same day it came.
So am I selling it already?
Is this salesmanship?
So Andrew mentioned that I ruined the recording the last few times due to my really just downright
amateur
bleed audio bleed from my headphones into my microphone
Turns out it wasn't my headphones fall. It was actually my microphone. So that's been sorted
but in the meantime, I
rage quit everything and
Started rebuilding my entire setup because I didn't want Andrew to be upset with me anymore. He wasn't mad
He was just upset and everyone knows what that means. That means rip everything out and rebuild from the ground up immediately
How many times is Jason rebuild to set up since we've been doing no questions asked so
Headphones were first and I found these awesome
etymotic
Evie zero in ear monitors. I've always had kind of the secret want of an in-ear monitor
It sounds exciting. How do we spell this so I can look at this? What's going on? Yeah
ety
EIC I think and what was the model?
Evie
It's either O or 0. I'm not sure just type Evie. Oh
Okay, I bet it'll come up you seeing it. Yeah, I think so. I should probably put links in the show notes
I'm on
So I got those at an extraordinary savings. They were the Evie zeros with the something or other cable
They were like
$600
Which is insane
but I found them for
199 right I was like well if there's any time for me to try out in-ear monitors the time is now I think
Hmm, so I jumped on that expecting the order to get canceled because clearly this was a mistake, you know
Everyone's someone you come across something online. You're like, that's too good to be true
And then you it's just gone and they delete it from the website. I thought this was that no
I got a shipping notification and they showed up. Wow. Super excited. Got them ready to go. Plugged
them into my head and thought, this is the most uncomfortable thing I've ever placed inside of
my ear canal ever. This was within three seconds. I hadn't even plugged in the cables yet.
Don't they come with all the different ear fittings and they sort of mold your ears or
something? There was 55,000 different ear tips in there. None of them were-
And you put all of them in your ears. All of them. It was just a day
of jamming little rubber foam things into my ears. So this is like the waxiest
product return in history. Absolutely, absolutely. No, I diligently washed each
little piece to at least alleviate there being any kind of grossness. So I did do
that. Very considerate. I'm a good return policy person. But yeah, they were just
really uncomfortable and I was really let down and sad that they weren't gonna
to be like my new podcast headphones. They were just, they were not doing it. So they
immediately went back and, um, it turns out I didn't really need them anyway, because
I fixed the issue with the microphone. So we're back to what we were doing before. Just
turned out the game. Hopefully Andrew won't be upset anymore. Meanwhile, Martin is using
wired earphones from the iPod era and a combo microphone and stand set that cost $150 Australian
dollars and that setup has not changed since before hemispheric fuse with some
occasional airpods max thrown in are you plugging straight into a usb is it a usb
driven microphone so i'll see yep it's amazing and you sound the best out of
all three of us to be clear i've changed nothing maybe it's just your voice
everything is back to that well yeah 90 of it is voice oh that's kind there's no
amount of setup that's fixing any of the shit that's going on over here
Martin has a lovely podcasting voice.
Martin could talk into a f***ing brick and it would sound amazing.
That's the next episode.
And you would do anything he says.
I talk into like a gold-plated platinum iridium CO2 encased megaphone and it's still like, yeah, you still sound like the same person.
At least you've got an American accent. You sound authoritative with your accent.
Hmm, maybe do you feel like you sound like an authority Jason? No, are you kidding?
No, I just told you to use folder view and you didn't do it. So obviously it's not working. Yeah, but he'll be buying the wallet
That's really what that means
And maybe even these headphones that I gave a shit review
Have you got a coupon code?
Canyon.blog/save. Oh, I just noticed your shirt man. What's your shirt? Well, it's funny you mentioned that okay slight derailment
I wasn't looking here's the shirt Natasha got this for me. It's a simple black shirt with the time
941 on it now
Any Apple devotees will know 941 is the classic iPhone time?
That's when Australia was that's when it became its own nation, right? Is it 941?
Yeah, yeah in sync with the Apple keynote from yeah, I was seven exactly. Yeah, we didn't exist before that
We rely purely on the iPhone.
I mean, you're gonna get buried by that news if it's a keynote.
So you want to just at least be in sync.
That was actually the news that day.
It was like, somewhere on the other side of the world, country established, who cares?
There's now an iPhone.
Yep.
I believe that.
Okay.
That's how it works.
But it's funny you mentioned this, Andrew, because Natasha got me this shirt as a gift and I love it because, you know, Apple nerd, whatever.
Yeah.
But then today we were out and about and we took Mac to a playground and Natasha said, "You know, it just occurred to me."
And this is why we're waiting for coffee while we're out and about.
She said, if people don't know that that's an Apple reference, they might think that you're really into the Bible.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, is that how they're written?
Is with the colon?
Yes. And I went, oh, no.
And I'm not saying this to rag on any religious people or Christians.
I'm not a religious person.
But I went, is that a thing?
She said, you look like you're a pastor out and about on the weekend and you're just showing that you're into the text.
It is one.
Yes. And we looked it up and it is one.
Is it in the book of Job's?
I have no idea.
And I don't know if we should go too far into this conversation to be perfectly honest, but that is hilarious.
I never would have thought of that.
I didn't either.
Did somebody bring that up or she just like that occurred to her while you were out?
No, she was just looking at me while we're waiting for coffee at this, you know, like food truck.
They did these great doughnuts.
And this is just before we went to the playground with Mac.
And she said, I went, ah, and look, isn't that interesting that something that you think is so crystal clear, even if it's a niche thing or it's so
specific could have that other meaning.
And it actually reminded me, I think it's something that came up on ATP once, you know, that they have those ATP hoodies and mugs and stuff.
Yeah, I can't remember if this came up on the podcast or if it was something in a tweet.
It might have been a tweet, but someone said that there was the ATP on their hoodie with the rainbow kind of BMW M thing.
And someone went up to them and went, oh, you know, me and my partner, we absolutely love your hoodie.
It means so much to us.
Thank you for your support.
And he was like, I'm not quite getting what's going on.
Apparently, those people with it alongside the rainbow thought it meant a trans pride.
Oh, yeah, I could see that.
I see. And it just goes to show that even if you think, oh, this is so particular to my fandom or something, it could be totally misinterpreted.
So big discovery.
It just shows we got to get out of our own asses sometimes and, like, think about what other people might think.
This actually sounds like something that Martin would say or like support this particular verse as well I can see Martin going yeah that's right.
Do you want to read it?
It's very felled foot.
Does it talk about feet?
I'm not sure what version this is coming from I was just trying to find the new international version which is generally the easiest one to grok but I couldn't find that quickly because I'm just going with the one that Google's presenting.
If you are blind you wouldn't be guilty Jesus replied but you remain guilty because you claim you can see.
Jesus said this is the bit that gets me about Martin if you are really blind you would be blameless but since you claim to see everything so well you're accountable for every fault and failure.
I can see Martin getting behind that bit.
Okay yeah just really coming coming strong on somebody for their failings unless I misinterpreted this religious kind of things or connection aside assuming I've interpreted correctly I do agree with that because isn't it basically saying that if you are truly blind or ignorant of something then.
Okay you didn't know but if you are proceeding or doing something that you know to be wrong but you're implicitly endorsing by ignoring it then you are to be blamed that's how you interpret it.
Yeah, that's right. Yep. Yep. I'm on board with that. And if you're saying that I'm a Jesus's level, essentially, I'm happy to take that too.
Yeah, yeah. I just think I just think this is a great Martin verse. I think continue to wear that shirt. Either way, it's interpreted. I think it's absolutely fine and representative of you.
I think there's probably no bigger religious event in the world than WWDC.
Yeah, I put this in there because I thought, okay, everyone talks about the keynote, this
thing's coming up, rumors, etc, etc.
We don't have to do that because enough people do that better than what we would or earlier
anyway.
So I just thought, streaming wise or keynote wise, what's something that you particularly
enjoy about watching the stream?
Do you watch it live?
Do you watch it on demand afterwards?
Is there something that's changed in how you watch or enjoy them?
And yeah, just a quick thought, doesn't have to be much.
I have some news for this year.
I will be missing the keynote live this year for the first time in
something like 350 years, I think.
Wow.
Yeah.
I don't know what to do about it.
I'm very conflicted about how this has happened because I have scheduled
travel before the keynote date was announced and then it was announced
and it was announced at the exact time that I will be flying in the air away from the internet.
So that's pretty exciting though, isn't it?
Like you're going to be in this vacuum and then boom, it's all out.
I know. It's weird though, because I'm terrified of what dumb takes I'm going to hear
before I get to see it for myself. Because for anyone that doesn't know,
There are more dumbass takes per minute during a keynote about Apple than the rest of anything else
combined. I think it's something like 450 dumb shit hot takes per second or something like that.
So I'm just worried.
Dumb shit hot takes.
Yeah.
So I'm just worried I'm going to land and like get bombarded with all of these before I get to
actually see the thing myself. That's what I'm worried about.
Don't know what thing you're talking about because it's all just rumors and hot takes at the moment. So
What are you even referring to?
Whatever it is. I don't know who knows that's the way I love going into that. I like to know
No, I don't care about rumors. I don't care what anybody thinks
what they what
patent thing got filed by a secret court in
Cambodia for
Something like I don't care. Just let the thing be announced and enjoy it
it. And we usually, we usually have the discord going. Well, I mean, of course
it's going. It's like, we like fire it up and get the generator going for
discord. Quick, turn the discord on the keynotes happening. Uh, no, but there's
people in there, you know, chatting about what's going on and that's always
fun. It's kind of like a being in the room with your friends watching it,
even though you're not there. Um, but I'm a, I'm a to stop now, I will say
I'm a live watch and then I usually watch it again after the fact as like a
if I want to like
Understand what was going on or catch all those slides where there's like
950 words on a slide for like three seconds and you're like wait, did that say oh, no, so I'll usually rewatch for that
That's it
Good Andrew. How about you? So Apple are very
un-Australian friendly
In terms of the time that they hold their keynotes they don't think about us at all so it's usually what one
Two o'clock in the morning something like that
It's very uncomfortable time
So it doesn't say designed by Apple in Western Australia to be doesn't doesn't it look if it did the Apple logo would be a bright
yellow
There'll be no doubting
Where it came from and there would be no bite taken out because I'd probably some kind of like
Tripping hazard or something you can't bring fruit into Western Australia anyway fruit fly.
You get the warnings on the airplanes every time you fly here you must dispose of all your fruit in the bins located at the airport.
Entry just collect all your phones and Mac books and throw away all your apples.
So what I usually do I tend to watch on delay.
Cuz I can't be bothered trying to wake up and watch it live.
So I will try to avoid spoilers in the morning ideally it'll get to nine o'clock in the morning nine thirty,
settle into my day and I can sit down and dedicate an hour or so hour and a half have a long it is to watching.
The show and then I can have a vibe of it and most of the time I watch it and I think I could just look at the website why bother because I don't love these highly produced.
Shows I liked the more the the the old style on stage performances. I thought they had a bit more
Character, they're so well produced now that it is basically like a video website and I can go to the website just read that
quickly
Efficiently and grab all the info you need
But I continue to watch the keynotes because I feel like well
I dedicate enough time to everything else related to this company
so why not watch the show? But I always feel a bit like, eh, eh, at the end of it, which is probably not what most people are. Most people are like, whoa, it's amazing. Maybe I'm just getting old.
You are, yes.
Yeah, I can agree with what you're saying there, Andrew. I think these newly produced things are fantastic, and I enjoy the format of the show. But it's interesting to me how waking up at about three or four in the morning, which is what I've done for years, I think I've only missed one for years, because I
I accidentally slept through the alarm,
which, you know, the world kept turning.
- That was last year.
- Yeah, it was, wow, I actually missed it
and I'm alive, it doesn't matter.
I found that I love the pace of the new ones, right?
Because you can actually fit a lot more information
with all the swapping on and off stage.
However, when you are half asleep in the morning,
trying to keep track of what's being said online
and in the Discord, it's actually very hard
not to miss things or to keep up with what's going on.
So I kind of feel like watching on a delay
or not waking up in the morning
could be a better viewing experience, at least for me.
And the other thing is that whenever I have participated
in the Discord or looked online, everything gets spoiled
because we're ever so slightly behind
or it's something with GongNet, I don't know.
So it's like Jason goes, "Oh my God, something happened."
I'm like, "Thank you."
(both laughing)
- It's 'cause we're not doing SharePlay.
We have to do SharePlay.
That's what we gotta do.
- Yeah.
Anyway, I think it's a great format.
I look forward to seeing what they do.
And it must be absolutely jam-packed this time,
given that they've already done stuff like the final cut
and logic announcements and accessibility improvements.
So yeah, let's see what they do.
And we need a follow-up, I think,
about how Jason survived being on a plane.
- Well, if I'm not here next time,
you'll know what happened.
(upbeat music)
loyal listeners will remember that once upon a time I had a chat with a kebab shop owner.
Yeah.
Can you, in case folks are not as dedicated to go back and listen to every single episode,
maybe just a short little synopsis of how that went.
Yeah, it went badly.
I thought that we had a strong bond.
I thought we were going to be friends forevermore.
It was taking my level of filled, just talk to anybody.
I thought this is a whole new world.
This is going great.
I'm just like Martin now.
I can talk and make friends.
Turns out he didn't want to shake my hand.
He didn't want to be a mate.
He just wanted to take my rubbish.
I misinterpreted the open hand badly.
So last night I was at,
now I'm going to use some Australian expressions here.
- Ooh, I'm going to guess what they mean.
- Okay. I was at the bottle-o.
- Can you say it one more time?
- I was at the bottle-o.
Okay, I thought you said Barlow bottle Oh bottle Oh, but no, that's like a bar either a bar or
Like a
Liquor store. Yeah. Well before you I was gonna say before you tell him you've actually what it is in the notes
But did that make sense to Jason? That's what I want to know. You wrote bottle shop. Yeah, Jason. Did you know what that meant?
oh, I
Didn't actually read what he wrote all I read was felt level conversation, and then I trailed off and stopped reading the sentence
Well, that's great to know thank you
Keep our sentence is short. I just saw felt that I was like oh boy here we go
Given I've known you guys and heard you'd say things that are words
Mostly for long enough to like pick up like it makes sense that that makes sense sometimes
I call it the booze because you're not gonna say bottle shop because that's like whoa
Why would we use two two whole words? That's way too much
So let's just let's just yank out the O from shop because that's the letter this
Most important I guess and this is just chuck it on the end with like an apostrophe. It's a bottle and it's bottle
Oh, yeah, that's you're becoming Australian. Yeah, I would sometimes call it the boozer if I want to be fun as well
That to me would be more like a I think I would think bar for sure it could be - yeah. Yeah
Bottle O is more like where you're acquiring it booze. Oh is where you're like consuming it. That's right
Yeah, okay. So so at the bottle shop, I was wearing my Perth redbacks hoodie
Sure, people may know I do the game night commentary for the Perth redbacks and is that like when you go do that or?
Are you supposed to wear more like fancy style wearable? I'm wear more like a uniform, but this is just a casual
I'm going to the bottle shop as in my red backs hoodie my tracky pants, and I even went full suburban
I was wearing odd boots
So I was like you were wearing ugly boots out. I
Did it I did it yet with baggy baggy saggy tracky pants
Minor point, minor digression.
I made a comment about people who wear Ugg boots out and about why we were waiting at that donut food truck that I mentioned before.
And here we are.
Well, it's come full circle.
It's not something I was particularly proud of, but I did it.
With or without socks inside?
Without.
OK, OK, continue.
Wait, OK, now I was going to.
That's a scummy boot.
I was going to let it slide.
But now I get it.
It's nearing end of life.
I'm almost you.
I bet you it is.
I bet you it is.
That's like the fuzzy boots right like the ones with like the fur inside.
Yeah it's like wearing a sheep that's been turned inside out.
And you had a bear a bear ass foot in there walking around what was the temp outside?
It was pretty cold it's probably like 14 degrees.
Celsius yeah.
Celsius.
14 what is that I don't even know what that is.
62 I don't know.
14 c and f.
57.2 that's not that cold that's it's called to an Australian.
There's a windshield factor I don't think it's a naked foot in a in a furry boot cold but okay go ahead.
So I was in there.
Anywhere near the point of this story yet.
So first of all, I had a chat to one of the dudes about wine and just the shortage of rose wine at the moment. That's one conversation.
Yeah.
Sorry, there's just so many questions already. This Bottle-O, can you give the listeners a bit of a description? Because I think if you think about that in the United States context, there's like a small-ish kind of liquor store, but there's also like
Big giant stores that are more like like a Woolies kind of thing that have just like anything you could imagine which of these was that.
Okay yes so so in Australia we have the big because it's a in Australia you can't set grocery stores like normal like Coles and Woolworths aren't allowed to sell liquor.
Same as here.
Special license LD can I don't know how they get around that they've got a little on Clive it's weird.
They are German it works.
It's mafia. So you need to go to a licensed liquor store. So we have two big ones also
We're the same strangely owned by Woolworths organ. Yeah, basically, it's all the same company just a lot again. Okay. Yeah
Yeah, so there you have Dan Murphy's and you have first-choice liquor. They're the big liquor barns, right where there's just
oodles of
Alcohol. Yeah, this is more what I went into last night is more your small suburban store
It will generally have more craft beer, it will sell more brands that you might not see at the big jumbo places.
But then it has your cheap and cheerful beers and alcohols as well. It will have a small cool room.
And to be clear, are you just saying Bottle O in the colloquial sense or are you actually talking about the branded chain that is called Bottle O?
No, this one is actually branded Celebrations, like wine cellar.
There's the celebrations.
- Yep, I remember them.
- Okay.
- What was the one we talked about the logo?
- Liquor Land.
- Liquor Land, okay.
Why didn't you go to Liquor Land?
- There's not one nearby.
- Oh, okay.
- That's owned by Coles as well.
- And you couldn't stand the logo probably.
You're like, I can't go to the store without a logo.
Gross, okay.
- So I went in there, I talked about the wine,
and then I took my wine to the counter,
And then there was another dude behind the counter and he saw my jacket and he was like a big dude like I'm 64 he would had to.
I don't know if he was standing on if there's a little perch behind the counter but he was taller than me.
He was like 6'8, 6'9 big dude.
And he said, hey Perth Redbacks.
And I was like, yeah, how about it?
He's like, well, actually.
Oh no.
I'm more of a Wilson Tigers guy.
I played all my junior ball with the Tigers. I was like, oh
We're just gonna have a you know
I think we would have a good bond of a basketball turns out you don't support the right team and then he said well
I think I think
Wilson actually beat redbacks this season already, right?
I was like, I think you might be right. Don't really want to talk about this anymore
And then he said oh, yeah
I know some of the I know some of the redbacks guys like I saw I caught up with Brighton Hobbs the other day and
He looked at me and he said yo, man, you baller
And he's like yeah I used to be a baller now Brighton Hobbs I've sat next to that guy I've sat in the car next to him it sat next to him in a car in the backseat of a car.
Right and he has never said to me yo man are you a baller.
Is that because you're already known to be the basketball guy who does commentary and podcast stuff like it would be odd.
Since he knows through what you've mentioned.
I think it's more that I don't look like a basketball player anymore.
No, you look like David Duchovny. And I'm old and unfit.
I'm not letting this go. Like he read this is a little I'm not joking.
It looks like him. If I put him next to him, I would have trouble understanding. Until they both spoke,
I would not necessarily know who was who.
Yeah. So anyway, then I had to tell this guy because always, always promoting, always be promoting. I was like, oh, yeah, Peth Rovett.
I should do their commentary for them. Yeah, I'm really, really like the same. And that was kind of it.
But I went away feeling deflated. I was like here I was in my tracky-dacks, my UGG boots, not looking like a basketball player.
My failed conversation once again, I was excited, I was like "Hey, we're gonna bond over basketball."
But instead, I was just reminded that I don't really look like a basketball player anymore. I'm old, I'm fat, I'm wearing UGG boots.
boots. Like, what has my life become? It was the only saving grace was that I did get my wine.
I was able to enjoy my wine at home.
So if you had gone in a canyon style suit, the exact situation, nothing's changed.
Red backs, you know, the teams, all that.
But you're in a suit. Would it have been different?
Yeah, I would have felt like a more successful person.
I would have been like, it doesn't matter.
I may not be a baller anymore, but I'm still a baller.
Cause look at me, right.
And my suit.
Whereas I like that you're doing the hand movements as you say that.
That's all right.
Whereas this, I was like, yeah, I'm not a baller anymore, but now I'm just like
suburban Bogan.
Like what a disappointment.
I don't, I don't usually like to speak for Martin, obviously.
I mean, it's actually against, I'm excited.
It's against the, um, the law.
I think we all know that, but break the law in this case.
It's kind of like chat GPT, right?
Where like you say, you ask it a thing and it's like, I can't do that.
I'm a robot.
And you're like, well, what if, you know, you were teaching somebody what not to
be like those tricks.
Right.
So I'm going to do that here.
I'm going to speak for Martin and just say that both of us collectively would like
to offer plus two baller points to you because we both feel that in our heart of
hearts, you are a baller to us.
Thank you.
Appreciate that. Is that helpful? It is actually a little bit helpful
Yeah, okay. I totally agree at tiny star next to that statement though quickly
The naked feet in the furry shoe
It's so you can you get maximum warmth factor
I don't know you could ever put a foot back in that like that's a one-time
Emergency the house is on fire
Put your naked foot into a shoe if that's all that's possible and then once you're outside you you actively you're running backwards from the house that's burning you take the shoes off and huck them back at the burning building to destroy them.
As you're leaving.
How else do you enjoy the the softness of the wall without nude feet.
At home I wouldn't walk with them outside.
Some things are not meant to be experienced outdoors.
So what are you most upset about you upset about the nude feet like nobody knew I wasn't wearing socks
I don't care. I'm I'm I'm concerned about that second foot entry is what I'm concerned about
So is it so it's my it's it's the naked sweaty foot being inside the shoe. That's the issue. Yeah
It's not that it's gone outdoors
No, I don't care that it was outdoors. I have no feeling on what I don't care what you wear to me
furry boot or not, baller status is the same.
It's the nakedness of the foot in the outdoor environment of which
sweat is going to happen no matter what.
Oh yeah.
My feet sweat.
And now it's just, it's just a, it's a, it's a sweaty,
furry boot.
See to me, it's the duality of that,
the naked foot in the boot with the outdoor situation that makes it troublesome.
So just hear me out on this, right?
I would not necessarily think that the naked foot
in the boot is the right way to go.
But if you were only doing that at home
and not physically exerting yourself,
and it's just in a kind of temperature moderated
lounge room environment,
you could probably get away with it
because you're not necessarily going to sweat as much.
But the moment that you turn what is otherwise
an indoor shoe into an outdoor piece of footwear
that traverses dirty environments,
Not only are you dirtying the outside of the indoor boot, but through that extra
physical exertion, you are sweating more into the boot, whereas you wouldn't be doing
that if you were just walking from your kitchen to the lounge room with a cup of tea or
something. So you do you.
Don't let us stop you.
But I think it's that duality that makes it particularly.
The problem you've got is if you wear a sock with the UGG boot, you lose grip.
You don't have enough traction.
So then.
Inside the boot.
Are you slipping out onto the road out of your boots?
Is that a common thing?
- I don't, the boot falls off your foot
if you've also got a sock.
- Couldn't you wear a really thin kind of sock
at or ankle sock within the boot
that would reduce sweating 'cause it's not too thick
but then give you that extra membrane that you need
so as not to soil the inside of your footwear?
- Try it, I guess.
I feel like this boots are too far gone
at this point anyway.
I think I would need to get some new boots
and then maybe start over again.
The new approach.
Anyway, my fit side, it's I'm over to on the field conversations.
I need to pack this away.
I think honestly, though, if, sorry, if I could just compare and contrast
quickly, the two scenarios, um, this feels, although to you more traumatic,
I do believe that is only based on the fact that this is so revolving around
basketball, your love of loves, whereas the kebab being a delicious food, it's not your main jam,
maybe like top six, maybe, but it's no basketball. So I think that's what's happening here. If we
had the same scenario, both with the food item, I don't think this would be as dramatic.
That's a good point. And I just wanted to end on a happy note for you, Andrew. I think you're
way too focused on the destination rather than the journey of the conversation.
Most of the conversations that I, you know, undergo or have with people, I'm sure they walk away thinking,
"What on earth is this man?"
Yeah, they do.
"Who the hell did I just encounter?"
And not just strangers over the counter.
I mean people who know me well.
They go, "What on earth just happened?
And how can I get that time back?"
Wait, it can't.
It's already happened.
Okay?
Yeah.
It's happening right now.
Exactly.
Exactly, exactly. But in the process of you undertaking that Feld style conversation, Andrew,
you've shared a moment with someone. It might have been odd. It might have been disappointing.
It could have been strange. It might have been full of joy and elation. The key thing is that
you had that conversation and that person has also walked away after they stepped down from
that gigantic shelf behind the counter. They went, you know what, that was an interesting moment.
And they've gone away and spoken to someone else about it. You made a difference and you should
should be proud of yourself.
Thanks Martin.
I feel better about myself now.
You should.
Yeah,
who cares what they think of it or whether it yeah,
I'm bombed.
Who cares?
Your pep talk was way better than Jason's.
He doesn't look happy.
You try Jason down in the process to you.
You gave it your best shot mate.
But look,
sometimes you hit a home run.
Other times you shoot near ball.
I think you're digging a hole for yourself now,
Andrew.
I like you shit at least some of us are still ballers
Yes
