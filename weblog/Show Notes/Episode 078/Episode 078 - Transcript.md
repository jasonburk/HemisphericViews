*Music*
*Singing* Is my body tuberculous for you baby? I don't think you're ready for this jelly. I don't think you're ready for this. My body tuberculosis for you baby.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Um, can I, can I give us a pat on the back real quick?
If that's okay.
Um, I just wanted to give us a pat on the back that this has been now, uh, what 70,
is this 78 episodes now?
70.
78, but we had the zero, zero, zero.
So it throws us a little bit.
78 episodes where none of us have missed an episode in that entire span.
Like how amazing is that?
Yeah, it's really good. Yeah, it's really good right Martin
My
Z. Oh, man
Huh, that's a little bit of a a little bit of a damper on my celebration
Unfortunate we are footless footloose, but if you will
And fancy free wait, what's the one where he slides across the floor?
or in his socks.
- Oh, Risky Business.
- Risky Business, that's right.
Footloose is the other one.
Yeah, close.
There was feet involved.
- Yeah, Footloose is the one with the song.
- Sure, right, that makes sense.
Yeah, you wouldn't have the Footloose song
in Risky Business, that would be weird.
- But then Risky Business had a song, what was that one?
- It wasn't that when he did the slide?
- When he did the slide, what was that song?
I'm going to just say that it was the footloose song.
Maybe we could, maybe we could edit that.
We'll get the scene of him sliding across, but it'll be the footloose song.
And that'll be a new thing for everyone.
Yeah.
Can you just imagine already Martin at this point would be losing his, I was sort of thinking about this.
I was like, we are basically running this show without the guy who keeps us under control.
So you're saying this is going to be like a three and a half hour adventure.
Yeah. And I've got to edit it. So type 45,
but at the same time,
it's going to be really hard to stay on track without Martin saying now,
now guys, we're really need to keep it, keep it on track. I have to go.
I have a hard out.
Yeah. The old hard out. Yep. Oh, the hard out with that guy. Right.
So many hard outs.
We don't know where he is. So I just want to stop any incoming email right now. No clue. Not sure. We'll see. Maybe in two weeks he's back. Maybe not. I don't know. I mean, the good part is that we're still hemispheric views technically.
We are. Yeah.
So.
Still got that bit covered. Maybe we, I just did my little Martin impression.
Oh gosh.
Yeah, that's spot on.
Really uptight. How about you? Could you be Martin for a minute and see if you can do a Martin impression?
Guys, if you could just stay on track, that would be great.
I think that, I think that probably, don't you think?
Was it like he was here?
It was very much like that.
Yeah.
You're like, whoa, how did he get to your house?
That's so weird.
Surprise.
Now, if I could just spin this back to the topic at hand in our show notes.
Hmm.
Oh, could you?
Please, please do.
What do we have?
We had nothing in the notes for quite a while.
And then the notes exploded into like 800 shows worth of stuff.
We overcompensated.
I think what happened was we panicked.
We're like, there's nothing there.
Overcompensated and now there's 357 topics in the queue.
Exactly.
Where do you want to even start?
Where do we start is the question.
all podcast good podcast do they go with the follow-up first?
Mmm. Yeah that's kind of the way we go about it so I think we should do the
follow-up and that I'm looking at that is the robot where it's a check-in on
Andrew's Obsidian quest arc. Yes yeah. Probably because it's following up from
a previous episode people can pick up. The world has been dying to know can you
give us a little bit of an update. So I've installed Obsidian. Okay, that's the
first step. Well, to be fair, the first step is acceptance, right? The first
step is acceptance that you're going to do this. Yeah. Then the install comes and
then what happened? So then I resubscribed to Readwise for another 12
months. Sure. So I was then able to have the Readwise plugin suck in all my
highlights my historical highlights so now I have all of those in there yeah how fun
was that?
It's just legendary now you've got just nice bolded list.
10 seconds yeah it's beautiful and since then I have been using log seek consistently.
Hold on let me quickly rewind real quick just take like one step back so we got we got the
install done. Yep. We got the plugins going. Sounds like that was all right.
Then we got... I did the plugins like you recommended. Okay, things are
coming in. Sounds good. And then your next step was to use something else. Yes, the
thing that I had been continuously using for the last few months. Okay, so by
bringing this into your life, I have now since pushed you further into what you
are already using. Is that fair? That's probably, yeah, that's about it. And it's
It's basically, I didn't have the energy to learn another piece of software.
And I keep looking, there's something, I have a mental block about Obsidian.
I'll load it right now.
So I'm looking at it.
I'm loading it and it's like, "All right."
Just feel like, "Okay."
And I've got this constant, and it's got these, and then you go to iOS and you get the vaults.
Yes like I have I've installed the daily plug-in but it seems like it sees that as a different vault to my everything else stuff.
I just want everything in one vault sure sure that may be a failure on my behalf maybe I'm needed to put that in a subfolder or something.
Rather than at the root level of the obsidian directory so that may be a fault of mine but it's like I just want everything and ask me to keep saying open a vault I want the other for I want them all wished.
If I were to bring in an expert if I had the power to bring in an expert right now as if it were like almost a call and show would that be helpful.
Absolutely be helpful I feel like I need coaching.
I might be able to do that. Let me let me see here if I can get the phone lines open.
Oh, phone lines are open. Ah, okay. Here we go. So welcome caller. If you could,
the task at hand is to describe in detail, the architecture of JSON files within obsidian
as a construct. If you could explain that we're having a little bit of an issue getting Andrew on
board here. I'm glad you've brought that up because I've been told that this is an open,
free-form, unscripted opportunity for listener participation. And so with that,
I would like to bring you user-generated, unannounced trivia corner.
What? You heard it here first. You heard it here first. That long game just got a little shorter,
ladies and gentlemen. So I'm going to get to the answer to your question and decipher
everything that you need to know about JSON and Obsidian.
But first, unannounced trivia in the corner,
question number one.
- Wow.
- How many instances of Bear are currently in my doc?
Is it A, zero, B, two, C, five, or D, Obsidian?
(laughing)
- I will go first.
Zero is clearly not correct.
I think we all know that.
Two, what's the old saying?
Two is one bear, one bear is not enough.
Something to that effect.
- Two bears in the hand is worth JSON in the bush.
- In the bush, yes.
Yep.
I'm gonna go with five.
I think five feels right.
- That's an Australian saying, isn't it, Andrew?
- We actually have drop bears.
So if you're in Australia,
it would be drop bears in your dock.
- It's true.
are a very dangerous animal. You need to be very careful of them. They fall from trees,
attack you. It's a well-known challenge for international visitors dealing with Australian
drop bears. Australian drop bears, okay. I also, see my heart is saying that Jason's got the right
answer with five bears. But I refuse to admit that Jason is ever right in anything. So I'm
gonna go with obsidian as my answer, given that I've just been discussing obsidian. So yeah. Okay.
Excellent. Excellent answers are noted. Question two. What is the correct placement for a max
dock? Is it A on the bottom, B on the right, C on the left, or D obsidian?
Okay. Well, okay. This is a bit of a trick question, I think, because the answer is obsidian,
But we are not actually able to make up sitting the dock until Mac OS 13.4.
That's very well documented at this point.
So I will go with bottom final answer.
Okay, now can I ask a clarifying question?
Are we talking about a MacBook Air?
Or are we talking about an iMac with Intel inside?
It doesn't matter.
Jason has decided that he's asking the questions apparently.
Okay.
According to Jason, it doesn't matter.
Okay.
Well, according to me, it does.
Because up until recently, I was a dock on the bottom guy for the longest time.
I have recently switched.
Up until recently.
I'm looking at my iMac right now.
Don't you dare.
And I'm seeing a glorious dock to the left.
All right.
78 episodes.
We're done here.
That's it.
Shut it down.
On the left.
Okay.
Third and final question.
Which of the following methods is the most effective means
by which to manage information assets?
Is it A, Yojimbo on the desktop and Devon Think to go on mobile?
B, Devon Jimbo on the desktop, Devon Think to go on mobile?
C, attachments to an agenda note cross-linked to Devon Think
and indexed in Bear, all platforms?
or D, finder.
(laughing)
- This is the gimme question of the century.
Gimme question, I love it.
- Hey Siri, why is Andrew like that?
- I don't know, Scotty.
Some people have- - Your entry heights are up.
- Invertible personality deficiencies
that can't be improved.
It's important to not dwell on that which cannot change
and instead focus on Andrew's best qualities,
Such as his co-hosts.
Okay, okay, thanks.
(laughing)
Wow.
That is the most coherent Siri has ever been.
In existence.
And very quick, yeah.
My goodness.
I'm gonna go from the heart on this one.
And I'm gonna go with Finder.
Because I think we all know deep down,
Finder is the key to everything.
Jason claim to have a heart and said finder so there are two interesting takeaways from one statement.
And I was one sentence yeah let's make sure we get that all in one sentence yeah I see how you can't believe there try to trick us in the bleeding out for a second Andrew.
So this value in all those answers except maybe finder.
Get all really good.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go the other option that you failed to mention.
Oh, and that's log sick.
Log sick.
Oh, log sick.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, does log sick sync with bear?
It's the same thing.
He just renames bear to log sick.
Yeah, I knew it.
I'm just going to put, I'm just going to mark Andrew down as incorrect.
Yeah, please do.
If you use hook mark to create links, you probably can.
All right.
And that is all the time we have for unannounced trivia corner.
That is the end of unannounced trivia corner.
That was that's incredible wow I am blown away.
I'm just glad that you got them all wrong did that answer your question about obsidian and vaults are you clear now.
Totally yeah yeah yeah I know what to do yep.
We can check that topic off and move on to the next one.
I think I think everybody wants us to check it off and move on.
I think so it seems fair.
This is a bit of a promo shout out.
Oh okay promo it out.
To a.
It's funny you should mention that Scotty actually well it's a good segue before I get to the before I get to the.
No it's not funny it's serious and if you want to save serious money you just need to go to Canyon dot blog slash save because remember if you're not spending money.
You're the product exactly can you not the product then just remember if you're not the product you're the chump spending money.
Exactly exactly and giving a nice kick back to me so everybody wins.
I don't know what the I don't know why people have an issue with this nobody does I have a good conversation with somebody who's work I have followed on the web for numerous years and we've exchanged emails from time to time but on the basis of his work.
And he is also a fellow micro blogger.
So I just want to give a shout out to people who may not have come across the work of Richard the sunny.
And he I will I just butchered his name and he knows I put his name because he literally said you can just call me Rishi.
Like immediately after you said it yeah yeah that was nice of him though.
Because obviously I got his name pronunciation so bad yeah I'm blaming my Australian heritage heat he does a lot of.
Good great writing around philosophy and stoicism how to live kind of like a better life.
And I find it is the fascinating he he I don't know what I teach system also he uses to manage all this writing because he.
He integrates cross links to other articles that he's written within his article it's almost like an obsidian database.
In his website it's incredible so you can end up following this rabbit hole as you read something like that's really interesting and he's he will hyperlink it and you click it on there's another whole nother article about that one little topic that he mentioned you can get to his website.
Dazzling dot net da is it in a dot net.
So I had a I had a I had a video conference call with him.
This way this yeah and we spent an hour talking and sometimes you find you like this podcast is great for this you find other people that you,
connect with and my hemisphere views is delivered in spades this is another one of those sort of connections were you like wow.
If not for this crazy internet I bumped into you through your writing and then I bumped into you because we were both on my blog and,
I feel like I know you even though I'd never met you and so we had a conversation and it was great
Really enjoyed it. So I just want to encourage people to check out his stuff
Because he is a really nice guy and I want more people to be
Aware of the stuff that he's putting out on the internet because it's where on earth could we possibly find a link to that though?
That's the question. Like where would it be? Well, I I read it out like you could just rewind your player
What if I play what if I was in what if my podcast player of choice didn't have a rewind button?
Maybe you could show
Show notes. Ah
Sure, is that the thing where everybody says they're gonna put stuff and then they never do is that that spot? Yes
Yeah, okay. Got it. Love it. Yeah, so we operate in a similar similar way, don't we?
But we do it a lot differently right where we actually put everything in there so that you can go back and reference it later
Exactly. So you'll find it there.
Okay. I look forward to finding it there.
And then I'm going to add one more thing to the show notes, because this is something
that Rishi recommended I check out. It's a YouTube channel and it's called Green Renaissance.
And they're like 10 minute videos reflecting on a person, telling something about their life
and how they go about living their life. I've watched a few of them and they're all really
impressive, really well produced, really interesting perspectives that people have
around how they live a good life or the experiences they've had. So if you're going through things,
you know, you want to try, you know, you want to think about philosophy, stoicism, being a better
person, enjoying your life more, both check out that website, check out the YouTube channel and
enjoy. - And the YouTube channel, he is not affiliated with that, he just recommended it to
you? - No, he just recommended it to me. So yeah. - Okay. - Yep. So I just wanted to say thank you
Tereshi for the time spent talking to him hopefully we can carry on and I want other people to know about a good person in the world which is part of what I show is all about.
You've got a little robot section here is dear near and dear to my heart because it's about an iMac you talking about you think you fix your iMac.
I'm a little bit afraid to say that, you know, it's one of those things where like you feel
like if you say it out loud, something's gonna just come back and bite you.
But I'm going to go ahead and talk about it a little bit.
So I don't know if you remember in ye olde days prior to Ventura, we had this thing called
accessibility and you always had to add a bunch of crap to it.
Otherwise you couldn't really use three quarters of the stuff you wanted to on your Mac.
Okay, no big deal.
Oh, on my beloved 24-inch,
whatever the heck year it was, iMac,
I upgraded to Ventura.
Didn't do the beta, I will say.
Never did the beta, not even once.
Said I'm gonna wait 'til release.
Okay, got the install done, rebooted.
Nothing would work in terms of accessibility.
That's weird.
Maybe I just need to re-enable it all.
No, the list is empty.
Everything that used to be there is no longer.
And I can't add anything to that list anymore.
So really, everything on the computer is pretty useless.
- So it's a highly inaccessible computer.
- Very inaccessible.
So off to the web, start doing some searches,
finding some things, nothing's working.
I'm left with, I can't reboot my computer
because if I reboot it, I lose all accessibility
and then I have to go in and do this crazy stuff
safe mode every time I reboot. It was a nightmare. No one could fix it. So finally, my buddy
Glenn over on Mastodon had posted a link related to this fix, which was slightly different.
I said, you know what, I've tried everything. Surely this can't work. Grab that link, go
through the steps. A couple slight tweaks on my end, but mostly the same. It's working.
It's working now. I had to delete, which I'm sure everyone knows about, the capital T,
capital C, capital C dot DB. Do you know about this TCC database? You know that one.
The old TCC.
The old TCC DB. Gets you every time.
You know, Jason, I've been hearing you haven't been filling out your TCC reports.
Basically, that's what it felt like.
You need a cover sheet.
I needed something.
And it felt like I needed a flamethrower to just destroy this entire computer.
So the way that it went was I would reboot, hold down the power button, because this is
is a M class iMac, not Intel, right?
Hold down that button, go into that safe mode.
Everybody loves the safe mode.
I don't think most people know the Mac has safe mode
'cause you almost never need it.
Go into that, go into options, go into disk utility,
mount your volume.
Now, not your volume volume, your data volume, obviously.
Okay, go back out of disk utility, then go into terminal.
So you already know, like, you're 50/50
gonna have a real bad day if you're in safe mode
and terminal, like, those are not places you wanna live.
So you're in there, you're rifling around,
looking for files, trying to find this TCCDB
with this cached-- - LS, LS, yeah.
- Yeah, you're LSing all over the place,
you're CD space dot-dotting to go up and down,
you're flying all over the place,
it's like the matrix in there.
You find all these files, you find this cache thing
that has no less than 57 other files in it
that are random strings that you're just gonna delete.
You don't know what they do.
You don't care at this point.
So you're deleting one after the other, after the other.
Why?
'Cause you can't delete that directory.
It's not empty.
- Ah.
- So yeah, deleted all that,
deleted the tccdb, bane of my existence.
Go back up a level, delete that whole folder too.
Just gutting, we're just gutting at this point.
And then we reboot.
- Yep.
- Starts up, everything's good.
We get in.
Everything starts bombarding me with needing permissions,
which is usually bad, but this is good.
This is a good thing because now we can rebuild it.
And we start saying, yes, okay, allow, accept.
Give that screen recording permission.
get in there on that full disk access, get in there, love it.
So I think we're good now.
So if anybody has any accessibility issues with their Mac,
I have the article for you.
Oh yeah, questions, yeah, questions.
- Yeah, I have an accessibility issue with my Mac.
- Ah, well, it's an Intel Mac, so it can't be fixed.
- No, the Intel one is fine.
It's the MacBook Air.
Every time I reboot,
I get like a bunch of apps saying, you don't have permissions.
You don't have accessibility permissions.
Yeah.
And I do.
I low into it and it's like, it's, it's, it's on.
And so I toggle it off and then I toggle it on again.
And it's like, Oh, thank you for giving me accessibility permissions.
Is this the same thing?
If, if I were able to bring somebody in that were an expert on this and help you,
do you think, would that be, would you be open to that?
I look if they know anything about TCC.DB because it sounds like maybe I'm afflicted
with the same thing.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think I have somebody that I might be able to bring in on this.
Let me see.
Let me get the call center open again here.
All right.
Call centers open.
I think we got the call.
We got the patching.
There's patching going on.
There's RJ45 cables.
Sorry, RJ11.
Oh, my mistake.
That was who was that just now?
Wow.
Like, what is that now?
Get your RJs right.
Seriously.
Man.
Yeah, I don't know how this...
Do we have a caller on the line that can help Andrew with an issue that he has right now
with accessibility related to his tcc.db folder?
Is there anybody out there on the line that can help us today in Radioland?
I don't know what that is.
Perfect.
That is exactly...
Does that help you out, Andrew?
You know, I was flummoxed and then I hear that answer and I'm like, of course, problem
solved.
Problem solved.
There it is.
Okay.
I've now heard about my tcc.db cover sheet from two people.
Two people.
So if we can get you six more, you will have heard it from no less than eight different
people.
My only motivation is to not get my ass chewed out.
Caller, did you have any other questions while you're on the line?
Thank you for your help with the tcc.db issue.
Was there any other...
Is there anything we can do for you, I guess, is really the question.
That's what we're here for, to serve the people.
Well, I don't know.
I don't have any technical issues at the moment.
How are you guys?
I think we're doing quite well now.
had at least two callers now, both of which have been helpful in solving problems for us.
So I think what we're trying to do now is really give back to the community.
Oh yeah, I apologize. I'm not very useful.
I have a question for you.
Oh, okay.
Because I believe we're talking to a friend of the show, Gabs.
Ah, yes.
Yes, and I seem to recall seeing on the discord, Gab's cooking like an absolutely humongous piece of steak.
Yes, that was last weekend and it was delicious.
So this is my question to you.
How did you cook that steak?
So, because you then demonstrated it raw and then you demonstrated it cooked, sliced, and it looked like it had the perfect combination of cooked on the outside, crisped up a little on the outside,
but still lovely pink in the middle.
And I want to know what is your method for cooking steak?
And is this a like a ethnic sort of approach that you have
that I, as an Australian have no idea about?
- Actually, I think that was pure luck to be honest.
But usually what I try to do is like, you know,
I try to use my cast iron for that
because it's way too cold right now
to be barbecuing outside. So I just depending on the thickness of the meat, I can assume
that it might take six minutes each side. And so I do that and then check and if it's like
how we like it, then it's done. Otherwise, I might let it another minute or two. But usually that's
just six minutes. Once I flip it six minutes, usually that's the trick. And if I really
want to cheat and get it perfectly every single time, I use the air fryer.
Perfect. That'll do it.
You heard it here first, people. That's how you cook steak. So Jason, what I'm picking
up here, and this is pretty important, is you don't flip. It's not doing flips on a
You're not doing a flip flop.
This is not a flip flop.
No, no.
This is like cook one side, flip one flip.
Yeah, one flip.
One flip.
Just like the...
One and done.
One flip.
That's what they say here in the US.
One and done, I think.
That's what I was taught.
Yeah.
Yeah.
See?
See?
It's universal.
Wow.
So now we've got...
We've had cooking corner.
I think we're inaugurating cooking corner, which is great.
So thank you for Gabby for that.
If you'd like to hang on the line, we may have some further questions for you later
if that's okay.
Yeah, that's fine.
Okay, thank you.
This is something entirely, this is amazing, this call-in show.
I'm loving it.
The only thing I'm not loving is how the hell am I going to edit this in later?
I could not tell you.
Can you imagine if this were Martin's week to edit and we did this, he would explode.
He would be so angry.
Here's your 53 audio tracks.
I'm gonna do it on a channel of the month of January.
Guys you could have let me know about this sooner so that we could have established the zoom recorder block in the audio hijack prior to the recording commencing to enable me to have all the audio files in synchronisation at the same time but don't worry I will make it work.
Wow that'll stay in that will stay in and he will hear that everyone else.
He's gonna just love this episode this is probably his favourite so far.
Do you know what I think you know what I've actually had a genius idea please tell me he's not here to stop it so let's do it.
You know what stuff editing let's just do live to tape.
Wow the show is the show do you think anyone would listen afterward.
I think it is such a departure i think it's gonna work you think so but it's like a once a week ago one off we can't tell you okay okay and it's in like twelve kilobit audio.
Will that be doing we've got a radio show going on here do you think radio shows don't edit.
I don't I think by the nature of them being live that would be impossible yeah.
So I think this is a man's gonna have a connection yeah this is not I'll just go on record now and just as a as a little bit of a cover for my ass this was all Andrews idea.
Martin so I'm happy with it what's next on our show is next let's see here's got through my iMac I don't know you pick we would you like we have no format now so I can't,
I can't I'm seeing this was sort of doing a bit of Mac talk this time I'm gonna talk about very quickly Mac talk or browser.
We talked about browser before we have.
Browser is the best freaking browser i have ever used what did i tell you safari is.
I've always been safari person but nothing of i couldn't get google chrome didn't like firefox all the other bits and pieces browsers didn't really go for it's always been safari is the best.
Quick easy eat nice and battery i just remove safari from my dog.
Wow I am all in on Arc this thing is freaking amazing they just released a new feature it's called Peak.
Peak I don't know if you use this if you've got a favorites if you saved one of your websites as a favorite it treats a little bit differently so whenever you click a website.
From one of those like a link on that page so you say you have a mastodon page saved as a favorite you click the link it doesn't open a new tab.
It just opens a window within your current tab to quickly have a peek.
And so quickly.
It's fluid and you can, if you're like, oh no, I really want to see that. You can quickly pop
it into its own tab, no worries at all. You can just command W it and that baby's gone.
It's so fluid. It's just incredible. There's so many, the side-by-side viewing you can do,
now you can do horizontal or vertical side-by-side web pages.
If you're reconciling your one app against your bank account there's nothing better like.
Oh I mean who's not doing that at least six or seven times a day.
I'm doing all the time so just if you are not on I don't know what the I don't know what the beta testing situation is on arc is it still difficult to get.
It's a it's a invite it's still one of those dumb invite things every single person gets five invites per week I'd I post the link.
On mastodon every week so if you want one just like wait a week and then they'll be one there so.
I should I would put my link on canyon dot blog slash save but because this is a free product I feel a little bit weird about that.
It's a little conflicting annual equal change every week so that's a one you got updated.
Monetization model is I super high that this is a month as a model like Netscape Navigator 1.0 was in the like send us fifty bucks and you get a browser.
I would love that to be the case, probably won't be, but I would totally pay 50 bucks
for this browser.
It is awesome.
Yeah, I can't say anything else.
I absolutely love it.
I started using it last whatever June, have not looked back since.
It's absolutely great.
And I think, I hope, I know they're working on a mobile browser already, but now with
all this new crap rules, whatever you want to call it, it sounds like we're going to
to be able to have browsers on iOS and iPadOS
that are not just skins on top of Safari
like they are now, which would be great.
And then the other side of that is, I believe,
I feel like I read this somewhere,
that Apple Pay is supposed to, at some point,
come to other places than Safari,
in which case, if that lands in Arc,
there's just no reason.
That's the only reason I have Safari at this point
is for Apple Pay.
- Well, that and SMS, auto-fill validation, 2FA.
- Oh, I took your advice on that.
I stopped being an idiot and I could just,
I'm now good at reading six numbers in under five seconds.
I've trained myself now.
'Cause remember when I said I couldn't read the numbers
and you're like, you're an idiot.
And I was like, yeah, okay.
So I do that now.
- See, neuroplasticity.
You don't need a Nintendo game to train your brain.
- Just, no, you just gotta read 2FA codes.
There you go.
Here's a weird idea. What if we just stopped using SMS for 2FA? Wow, wouldn't that be something?
Jason Bourke, that's crazy talk.
I know, it's wild. Some people are charging eight bucks for that now, I heard.
But yeah, you could just go to LastPass. I'm sure they have it. I think they have a great
security model.
Yeah, not a sponsor.
Definitely not a sponsor.
Definitely not a sponsor.
Okay, well, I'm happy to hear about ARC. I'm happy to hear that it has changed your life.
I think in at least three months from now it'll be the same exact topic but it'll be obsidian.
Jason Burke I'm really excited I'm so excited I keep calling you Jason Burke like I've somehow
adopted this. I'm here I'm here for it. I have a Martin segue I'm super pumped. Wow. So let me see
if I could do this. Oh segue it up. Okay Jason I'm gonna get my Martin voice on. Yeah yeah no
No, please take your time.
Jason, Jason.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Speaking of...
Yes, Martin.
Speaking of Arc browsers, I believe you know something a little bit about eArc.
Wow.
That was, it was like he was here.
Look at that.
Wollongong in the house.
Love it.
Good segue.
Very good connection between Arc the browser and eArc.
I love that.
Yeah.
eArc HomePods.
I think we already talked about, did we already talk about those?
- A little bit.
- I can't remember now.
- I think we did a bit.
- 'Cause we know, like, so flashback,
like months and months ago,
and 'cause Martin's been using the, like,
the HomePod stereo thingy for like forever,
but that was really just with an Apple TV,
if I remember correctly.
So it's like, that works.
My problem was always, I want other stuff also.
So like, if it's a gaming console or whatever,
I want other stuff to be able to go through that audio.
And now with eARC, we can do that.
Some kind of weird voodoo where it shoves it through to the TV.
Then the TV shoves the audio back to the Apple TV.
That's not even on.
And then that beams that over to two separate home pods that are not connected.
And it all just works.
I don't, I don't know.
It's literally voodoo magic that it works at all.
Whatever engineers developed that like kudos to them far out.
It's wild.
And this is what the OG, the old HomePod, the big ones, I'm just doing it with
those and it works perfectly fine every time.
It's wild.
So I think a few months ago I was talking about, I was looking for a sound bar
because I have, I don't, I think this is not just a me problem, but hearing audio
in, or sorry, not audio, uh, hearing voices in movies specifically.
It feels like it's impossible anymore.
And I don't think it's me.
That's exactly what it sounds like.
It's like a peanuts grown up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I thought, okay, what if I get like a big weird soundbar thing?
Like will that help separate the, whatever the stupid term is for like, can I hear the
damn movie?
Right.
Well, I don't need that now because these sound amazing and I can hear everything.
And they're just, at this point, they're just sitting on the floor.
We haven't even like put them on the thing yet.
They're still in the same way when I just like plugged everything in randomly wherever
there was plugs to like test it.
They're just sitting there and it sounds phenomenal.
And I will also say they're so responsive from a how fast you start something to how
fast it's playing.
I feel like the stereo pair connected to an Apple TV is some kind of different wireless
connection or something than when you do like a standard AirPlay.
Because you know like you do an AirPlay or like a handoff and it's quick but like it's
kind of longer than you would think it should be.
This feels like some other weirdness where it's like we know we only talk to that so
we're going to be like really fast.
But yeah it's I highly highly recommend whatever was the last update that brought all this
crap 16.3 I think if you've got HomePods or thought about doing this this HomePod stereo
pair thing it's it's epic.
So what I've done, I've still only got the one HomePod OG.
Okay, the big one.
Yep.
Listeners may recall that I have a receiver system and my old Energy Connoisseur speakers.
And I have, so I've got my stereo speakers, my center channel and my subwoofer, right?
But they're really old.
As an experiment, I didn't bother with the whole eARC thing.
But what I did do is I've got two HomePod minis, and I just plonked them on top of the
energy speakers. So you're using a very high-end speaker as a shelf for a HomePod Mini.
Okay. Yes, for a HomePod Mini. And it's hilarious because I've got one black one and one
white one. So it's all mismatched, right? Doesn't even match. Love it. Okay. Because I
just wanted to see what that what those two sound like. Minis, right? In a stereo
pair. They're really good. Like they're not as good as the
energy system because like, how could it be? I've got cones.
I mean, the volume, the volume of the energy speaker is like 75 liters.
Yes. So like it can't compete, but I, it has me thinking.
Cause you also remember this, like thinking about getting the whole Sonos
surround system.
Yes. I went down the path as well.
Which is like three and a half grand, like it's a lot of money.
and then you got like rear channels and all that kind of guff. Part of me is just like,
do I just buy two new HomePods and just be like, this is cool? Because it seems like if the Mini
is good but not quite as good, a couple of HomePod. - I think you want the big one if you're talking
like a TV, like room setup. Because the HomePod Minis, they sound phenomenal,
But they're so small, like physics dictates they just can't output what you want from like a TV
setup. But the big ones, I really feel like they can.
And I just like since then, I've been using, whenever the kids watch TV, I've just been
making sure they're using now the HomePod mini sound. And it's excellent, because it's just
toned it down. I'm not getting subwoofer blasts from some random, you know, Spider-Man Super
Friends show. It's, um, yeah, it's great. So you go. So I'm,
I'm still in flux as to what to do and all this stuff, but.
I really feel like HomePods are where it's at. And I'm,
I'm thrilled that the old HomePods work for this.
I wasn't sure that they would. So I, that's why, again,
I just sort of like randomly set them up on the floor, but.
Well, if there's anybody in Perth,
if there's anybody in Perth that has an original,
cause I would love to get a second original HomePod then that would,
So if there's anybody listening to our show in Perth,
who just wants to give me one.
And what color would that be?
You need a black one.
Black one.
Okay.
But because you're already mismatched on the mini's, if it were, at what point
does it, I don't care anymore.
You don't care.
No, no, no cares.
Okay.
So there we go.
All right.
So if you want to give Andrew a home pod, I mean, who doesn't want to do that?
Uh, yeah.
Look them up.
Yeah.
Canyon.
Just find.
Slash Canyon.
blog slash safe. I think there's a drop box for home pods. It's in the long game. Okay,
you will benefit in the long game. Somehow some way he'll give you a sticker. He'll give you
a sticker. He'll give you one of the new stickers for 2023 that I don't believe anyone has yet
because I don't even have them yet. New stickers. So new stickers for 2023. Yeah.
You heard it here first. What do we got next? So we talked to eARC HomePods. We love it.
We talked to ARC Browser. 49 minutes. Yeah. Okay. You think we're probably...
Because you have to edit. So you always have the long ones, as Martin says.
Is there anything... Do we have any other guests or callers or any other
audience feedback.
Do you want me to check in on the phone dashboard quickly and just see if
there's any other,
I think that's given that it's a call in show.
I think that's probably what we should do.
Okay. Hold on. Let me just check. Let me see. Are you hearing what I'm,
are you hearing the patching noises? I feel like that audio.
Yeah. It's like cables are actually being pulled out and plugged into a different
switchboard.
Are you getting that?
It's patching it through.
He's patching.
There is more patching going on.
Okay, I think I've got that open now.
It's a lot of wires.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Yeah.
It's um, phono plugs.
Go ahead, call her with your question.
Did you have a question or an answer?
We're open to answer.
If you want to give an answer, we can give a question.
That's also a thing.
- Is that for me?
Is that for me?
I got--
- Oh, yeah.
- Hello?
Hello?
- Call her, call her.
Are you?
Call her.
Go ahead, go ahead, call her.
You're live.
- Hello?
- Yes, yes, call her.
Yes, please go.
- Hi, have I reached?
Is this the Martin Feld show?
Yes, anything Martinfeld related, we're here for it.
- I had a question about HomePods in a stereo pair.
Now, right now I wrote all of my audio through Bear,
but I was wondering if I were to use HomePods,
like big boy HomePods in a stereo pair,
how surround soundy does that sound?
Like, 'cause I'm in that same sort of crisis about,
Do I tack on more Sonos speakers
to try and make this feel surroundy?
Except that my Sonos soundbar doesn't support Atmos,
so I feel like I'm building
on top of a deprecated platform.
I'm wondering if maybe I should just get a couple of HomePods
and a stereo pair and call it a day.
- Okay, okay, thank you.
I'll just, I guess I'll start quickly.
If you don't have Atmos,
you might as well have a monitor that says LED on it.
I mean, it's just, what year is this?
Right?
So you're gonna wanna get that Atmos first and foremost,
as long as, as well as Dolby Vision, right?
'Cause you're gonna wanna have the vision
in the Atmos. - You see it
before you hear it.
'Cause light travels faster than sound.
So you need Dolby Vision.
- I have a more budget approach that you can, may work.
- Does it involve using my Sonos speaker
as a stand for two HomePod mini's?
Because I've already heard that idea.
No, no, this is actually even better.
So what I'm suggesting is the careful placement
of two mirrors, okay?
Because what you'll find is the mirror
will reflect the audio.
So you'll have your home pods at the front.
So you're looking for, you want good sound coverage.
You want some Atmos experience.
So I'm saying you put your two mirrors behind your couch.
The home pods will push the sound out frontwards.
That sound will hit the mirrors, mirrors reflect.
So the mirrors reflect the sound and you'll get that full
surround sound experience.
Okay. I'm writing that down. Hang on. Canyon.blog/bullshit. Got it.
Thank you.
Slash save slash bullshit. Yeah.
Look, I'm an audiophile, you know, like you can,
you can go to YouTube and you'll see bunches of people talking about, Hey,
I checked out this audio speaker and it's like really cool, but it's $4,000. I'm an audiophile. Well, I'm telling you right now mirrors
Yeah mirrors mirrors and magnets and smoke you need smoke and
Hello Hemispherians, this is Martin speaking.
As you can probably tell, I was not in the usual recording of Hemispheric Views that
you just heard.
Different kind of episode, right?
No big deal, stuff gets in the way.
I had other obligations.
Currently travelling in Aotearoa, New Zealand with two of my esteemed colleagues, Craig
and Tim, for work.
I wasn't really concerned not to be in the recording, but very interestingly, Andrew
and Jason following that particular session sent me messages like, "Oh my goodness, Martin,
you're going to hate this.
We've destroyed the episode.
The podcast is ruined.
You should be really worried, blah, blah, blah."
And I'm thinking, what on earth could they have possibly done without my, I don't want
to say oversight, but let's say guidance from New South Wales as to what to do in the episode.
I'm hoping that we still have listeners.
I'm hoping that people have not fled to other tech adjacent podcasts, whatever they may
be or whatever the hell that term actually means.
But anyway, I'm just here to offer some reassurance that even if they have destroyed the podcast,
I'm still here by myself in a hotel room to offer you some form of entertainment.
So since I'm not in Australia at the moment but I'm elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere,
across the ditch as they say in Aotearoa New Zealand, I thought I'd offer a few little
interesting cultural observations since getting here.
The last time I visited the country was actually when I was in primary school so my memories
were a bit, they weren't great, let's say, about the country since being here last.
And it's been really lovely, the people have been fantastic, both the people I've had to
work with and the people that I've met around the place.
to travel with my two colleagues as I said, it's been a really fun experience.
But there have been a few little bizarro things that popped up that I thought would be of
relevance to you listeners and this very show.
First one being, we spotted a Woolworths logo, or Woolies as you would know.
And as we approached it, even though the Woolies logo was the same on the shop, the name was
not.
It was Countdown.
Now any New Zealanders listening are probably thinking, Martin this is old news, of course
it's called Countdown.
But I'm really quite staggered that we have a Woolworths logo, which if you know it, is
a W in the form of an apple peel, or like skin of an apple actually peeled off.
And then it's got Countdown next to it, which starts with the letter C and not the letter
W that Woolworths actually, you know, kind of starts with.
So it's like "Woo Countdown".
I'm not sure what the deal is there.
And when we entered the shop, it looked very much just like Woolworths, but all the fonts
were different, there were different products in there.
It was kind of like being in a Bizarro world.
If you've ever seen that episode of Seinfeld
where you've got the Bizarro, Jerry, Kramer, and George
when Elaine goes to a different diner,
it was exactly like that.
Guys, what is the deal
with creating five different audio tracks?
This is wild.
And just to show you that it was indeed
countdown with the Woolworths logo that I visited,
you can find a picture in the show notes
or as the chapter artwork,
depends what Andrew wants to do this time,
of me standing in front of said Woolworths slash countdown
in this particular town that we visited, Papakura,
and I'm holding four batteries that I needed to purchase
for a particular device that we're using
on our vocational travels.
Moving on from that particular point,
I was also very, very confused when we went to a steakhouse
in the town of Papakura called Stampede.
And when we were there,
we had some banter with the waitstaff.
You know, I was being my typical verbose self,
you're hearing right now. And we said, "What's one thing about Papakura that you would sell
to the world? Like, what's special about this town?" And she didn't really know how to answer.
And she went, "Oh, you know, a bit of this, a bit of that." It was pretty nondescript.
And then as she moved away, she then came back and said, "Oh, you know, I spoke to the
others behind the counter and we figured out that we're actually right in the centre of
New Zealand." And not just like the North Island where we happen to be, but the entire
country like if you measured from top to bottom North Island to South Island we're in the middle.
This didn't seem quite right and upon checking on the map we were still very much towards the
north of the country just south of the Isthmus where Auckland is. So I don't know what people
are teaching in geography at schools in New Zealand but someone clearly has to brush up
because this town does not even know where it is. Anyway these are the particular gems that I have
to offer at the end of the podcast. I don't know if anyone's even still listening. I don't even
know if this sounds good. I don't even know if there's still a podcast. But look, if you are
there and you're listening to me ramble about what is essentially a very weird topic for a kind of
made-up semi-absent version of Hemispheric View's Virtual Tourist Corner, thank you very much. It's
a pleasure. And I'm just going to go and do something else that you do when you're sitting
in a hotel room elsewhere in a place you don't know. I don't know what that'll be. Catch you next
