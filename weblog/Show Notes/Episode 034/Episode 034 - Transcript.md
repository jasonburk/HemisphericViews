Speaking of shoes and the things you wear inside shoes and Rob is very interested to bust you this evening
Oh taking a photo of your own new boots are in Williams. I believe very fashionable. You look very slick
Thank you, but inside them. I saw what appeared to be colorful socks
Let's look like there was some fun pouring out of those socks. Come on. No, don't be ridiculous
Well, I had fun looking at them. So what were they?
[Music]
So I had my new boots on, first outing for the new boots, very exciting day.
I was all suited up. It was a suit day today gents. It was suit sans tie though. I didn't do the tie today
I had I actually had every intention of doing the tie till I realized that I was wearing a shirt that was a little bit
Older and I've seemed to have put on a little bit of neck fat
So that top button wouldn't do up. So no tie. It suddenly became a no tie day, but socks
That's what we're here for socks. Now. I went shopping the other day. Well, and there was a giant rack of
horrific gaudy socks and I looked at them and laughed.
They're not for me.
And then I wandered over to the to the regular black sock section.
Now the only problem is I'm a size, in sock I'm like an 11 to 14.
Selections were limited in the 11 to 14 range and I didn't have the patience to go to a different store.
I was there ready to purchase socks and purchase socks I was going to do.
So I went for the three pack, three pack socks.
Turns out one of those packs, one of the three were black, all black, just perfect.
The other two have like a diamond pattern on the pull up ankle section, just a still,
I think they're blue, light blue, navy blue kind of diamonds.
Quite austere, I think.
But yeah, not totally black.
I feel like I was led astray because I bought it for a bought a three pack primarily on the basis of the one pair of straight black socks and those other guys snuck in.
This is like a sneak sneak attack.
Yeah yeah and I figured that since I was wearing they're not particularly high so I thought wearing a boot my pants it's only gonna show a sliver of.
Colored but it's still it's still business sock like it's not outlandish it's just diamonds.
You got Trojan socked.
I have two questions though Andrew number one did you have fun wearing them.
I was concentrating more on the boots to be perfectly honest but to the socks credit they were comfy they're quite soft I enjoyed them but I got no fun no fun I got no joy from wearing those socks.
I bet he did.
So the purchase was a mistake then anyway you don't you regret the purchase.
I regret it but the function the functioning assault they did the job.
Okay my second question and then I'll let you move on from this when you saw my name pop up on Twitter with a reply busting you with said socks.
Did you regret the photo or think I should have been a bit more careful with my pants height.
Yes and yes I was so pleased with the composition of that photo because that with the colorful umbrella.
I was focusing on just getting the colorful umbrella right and not realizing that socks were on display that was not the point of the Friday.
It was to see the boots not socks and I am a bit annoyed to myself.
Will you boots are lovely and I think the number one lesson that I've taken from this is that Andrew things umbrellas can be fun but socks cannot true.
Was it was it fun not carrying around two phones like an animal.
Cuz that seems pretty fun how is the pants situation where you can actually carry something else in your pocket other than a pocket full of phones.
Yeah well damn carrying an extra battery charger but that's going in the bag right now this is huge news this week so Jason.
Jason was really clever halfway through last week he just said to me because I was complaining about having to carry the work phone and the personal phone.
And he said to me what you just getting a sim that's a good point why don't I just get an ACM.
It's that a sim exactly so I was determined so turns out my pov personal mobile phone carrier doesn't support a sim that was annoying.
I ditched my provider in a hot minute and I went to.
Vodafone
That's right. Usually no small undertaking. I have to say when I said get an eSIM
I kind of just meant get the eSIM and be done with it. Next thing. I know he's traveling halfway across the
state to
Get a new carrier and and all this whole it was a whole thing was very
Very distressing because I felt like if this goes wrong at any point, it's gonna be completely my fault
It would have been he's gonna like lose his phone number or something's gonna happen and he's gonna end up with zero phones. Oh
I
Pushed myself into action
I didn't have a car that day
But I was still so motivated that I caught the bus to the local shopping center to the Vodafone outlet
Amazing service. I'm gonna give a credit to Vodafone. Okay, not a sponsor of the show, but the service I got
from the girl in the Vodafone shop was
Incredible she knew all about it. She knew exactly what I wanted. She didn't try and upsell me. She just took my phone
churned me away from my provider to the to now Vodafone and
within five minutes
My kept my number it all worked now. I've got one phone with a work
SIM chip in it and a personal eSIM and it's flaws and it opened up this whole aspect of the
iOS operating system that I never knew existed where you sort of choose which data
Provider you want to use and what's going on there and really really interesting to see how that this whole
Designed element exists and is only surfaced when you have this to sim situation going on
But can I just finish off the one thing that I've noticed is a bit annoying is if you want to switch
Like whether you're using your business data or your personal data if you want to alternate between those
You've got to get into the settings and find it and then toggle it. Oh, I have a fix for that
What I'd love to hear it because I had a fix and I don't think my fix is working, right?
always use works data
I thought today I thought I'm gonna look in shortcuts because I suddenly thought maybe
Shortcuts the app can create a toggle that will toggle me between them
And that's pretty clever of me to think of that and I went into the shortcuts app and I searched for data
And I found it and I was like, this is brilliant. It's gonna be a one-touch toggle
Right, you know what?
It is so annoying because shortcuts is annoying
Shortcuts get you this close and then just doesn't get you all the way
So all it allows you to do is toggle your current
SIM card
between
the G's so you can have 3G, 4G, 5G.
That's a lot of G's.
And you can you can choose to toggle the G's on either the personal SIM or the business SIM.
What you can't do is actually toggle the SIM in use which is actually what you want.
Like I don't care what just give me maximum G's right? I want to be like a top gun part
I want to be a top gun pilot. I want max G's but I want to be able to flip between
Personal and business when I'm getting those G's and it doesn't let you do that
And so I hit Google and I found Matthew Cassanelli's website
And he's got some
Epic shortcut that I tried to install and all it does is gives you a deep link into the settings page where you have to change
It yourself. Why would you ever want less G's?
I'm confused as to what that setting is really what's that for? I don't like it
What's the scenario where you're like, I really would like this to be slower
Give me the 2g
Why do you need to switch between different data? I don't understand
Are they not both unlimited or is this an Australia thing where you only get a certain amount of data?
per line, well we get we are limited so I think we have a
Definitely a reasonable amount with work, and I don't think I use it
I think I use it more on Wi-Fi than anything else, so I don't think it's gonna be really be an issue
but I just like the idea of being able to go off the grid in terms of
Work, you know okay that makes sense so if you were say it was the weekend, and you're like you know what I'm
I'm in weekend mode. I want to use my my data, so yeah, okay, all right that makes sense got it
Yeah, that is kind of weird. I never came across
I don't think I ever even thought of that when I had the two-sim thing.
It is funny seeing the little antenna lines though, like with the cut in the middle.
I always thought that was interesting.
Well, to me, I was just going to say, I can really relate to what you mean about shortcuts
because I think it's great that we have automation options and that people can do that stuff,
but to me, the cruel irony of the name shortcuts is that it's anything but a shortcut to actually
set anything up. When it was called workflow, you betcha there was some work involved and
now it's like, "Oh, shortcuts, everything's super fast. Okay, but I gotta order these
things and then think about the things that I want to make faster, but then I got to think
about what it's going to look like and where I'm going to put it and how am I going to
tap it and can we actually do it?" And by that stage, I could have just done the thing.
I find the biggest, the best use for shortcuts is for people to create blog posts about shortcuts.
It's such a great concept and when you talk about it, it sounds great and everything just
seems like, "Wow, this is the greatest."
And then, I don't know, it just never seems to stick.
You spend all this time creating this system to do these little things and yet it's like,
"Just make it do that."
I feel like Shortcuts has just been nothing but heartache for me personally, where I get
so excited about it and then it's just for one reason or another, like you said, it gets
you nine tenths of the way there and then it's just like, "Oh, no, I can't actually
do that."
And it's like, well, if you get these nine other data jar and 15 other plugins for shortcuts
and then you run a shortcut server on a spare phone that's cooked up to your network and
And it's like, guys, we've gone way too far.
Martin, can we talk about the very important night that tonight represents in Australian
socio-demographic analysis thingamabobs?
Andrew, you can announce this because I actually went to add this to the topic pool in our
notes, and I saw that it was already there.
I thought did I already add this and I forgot and then I messaged you and you had in fact already added it
So great Australian minds think alike. What are we talking about? That's right tonight is
Australia's official census night
the night where we all
Say answer a series of questions about the people residing in our home tonight
So if you happen to be sleeping over at my house tonight, you would have to represent yourself in my home. Not somebody else's
Nobody is sleeping over tonight, so it's just our family so but yeah everybody in nationally like
25 million people should be
Accounted for as part of the census tonight, and it's the what second time Martin that it's online. I think
That the second time
Correct and everyone's very happy about it as you can see on Twitter. Yeah, well well given the experience of our last online census
Where the service crashed and it didn't go well flopped big-time
Because they were using my Wi-Fi access point so yes, it's a big night
This is I'm gonna say that this is the very first census in my life that I've not been
Super exuberantly excited about you're normally exuberant was that I
Normally find like large-scale
statistical exercises
Kind of captivating that that checks out. Yeah, I don't know this one. I think it's the whole covert lockdown
But not that I'm locked down. Hey, I'm free as a bird
But I know it's just just seems overshadowed this time. Usually is a big build up. It's it's exciting
It's like everybody's gathering together to fill out the same questions
But this time I have a question. Yeah, you keep putting an emphasis on
census
night
Why is night important? Why is this at night? I don't understand
Why is it not just census day?
Can you only do it at night?
You have to wait till the Sun goes down before you're allowed to do your census thing
Well, it's about people who are staying in your house that night
I think that's probably why you're answering in response to the people who are
Sleeping in that home. So I think and I think it's just a traditional thing people finish their work and
And they come home and about capturing a moment in time and making sure that it's the point that everyone is doing the same thing
Well, the country was enraged about the census last time because it was a flop and this time around as far as I'm aware
Things have gone well
But the major complaints have had to do with and rightly so the fact that there are virtually no questions on things like
Different sexuality and the whole thing is based entirely in English when we pride ourselves on being a multicultural nations
That's a point that I sent through to Andrew before we started recording the show.
But yeah, and there's also a bit of controversy about the placement of the no religion option
above all the other religions, which is, you know, getting out of hand. But look,
we had a good time on census night and Natasha even took a celebratory photo because it was
Mac's first census. And we actually got around as a family around the old Mac mini that's connected
to our TV and we filled it out together.
And look, it'll be too late for the Australians who are listening to this podcast, but I'm
committing to denoting my religion as "Hemisferian".
And if you'd like to be a Hemisferian, you can go to oneprimeplus.com and become one
for as little as...
Your soul.
$2 a month.
And your soul.
Yeah, like any good religion, you need to contribute money to be a part of it.
You can actually keep your soul,
'cause I don't really wanna manage that.
That just seems like a whole other thing
that I'm gonna have to collect,
or Andrew's gonna have to make a Yojimbo box for it
to put in there.
I don't really wanna deal with that.
So you keep the soul, give us the two bucks.
I think that's like 87 Australian.
And then everybody's good.
You get bonus episodes.
Came out yesterday, great.
- Newsletters.
- I said orange a lot.
Newsletters, which is weirdly today of recording,
a new newsletter is coming out today, Hemispheric News.
So get on it, oneprimeplus.com.
- Best deal in town.
- Why would you not sign up?
Like you're getting so much stuff.
- So much value, so much value.
- I think we're over-servicing our customers, I think.
- Yeah, you get out your little scale, right?
Like Andrew has one of those little financial scales, right?
And you put one prime plus on one side of the scale
and you put value on the other side.
I tell you what, that thing is just buried into the earth.
It just, it can't, the value side is just,
it's dangerous, it's downright dangerous.
- And it's going to new skies.
- Yeah, so we provide no insurance on your scale,
but just know the value is there.
- Just a little sidebar, do you know,
I'm actually old enough, I remember going
to the post office when I was a kid.
And they didn't have digital scales,
but they would literally have those scales
and they'd have those little metal weights
that they would put on,
and then your parcel on the other side,
and they would balance it.
- Was there a goblin behind the counter?
- I'm just realizing as I tell that story,
exactly how old I really am.
Wow!
- Yeah.
- I'm positively ancient.
(upbeat music)
Martin, have you got a new toy?
- Yeah, I do have a new toy,
and I'll speak about it briefly.
I was already part of the M1 club,
I'm happy to have joined the M1 iPad Pro Club. I was obviously into the idea of buying one of
these things but the thing that tipped me over the edge was when Andrew posted about Center Stage
and I wasn't even really drooling over Center Stage although I think it's an impressive feature.
I just saw it and I thought you know what what am I doing here? I can buy this thing. We're doing
this podcast. I'm editing stuff. I have all these uses for it. So I went ahead and got it and I was
really kind of drooling over the white keyboard so I got that thing. Did you hear his justification
machine kick in real fast there Jason. Yeah yeah I love that that's my favorite machine.
Well it saves you know two questions which normally comes up. So there's the white one
and there'll be a picture in the show notes for people to look at. It's very very crisp and white
at the moment. I'm enjoying the little silver combo. So yeah I am happy to have engaged the
justification machine and if there are still questions I'll open the floor now. Go. You got
You got the 11 inch, not the 13 inch.
Did you consider the 13 inch or did you know you were going with the 11 inch?
And when he says 13 he means 12.9.
Which is the 13.
Correct.
I very briefly considered it because I thought, "Oh yeah, no, that's good for looking at photos
and larger column views and that sort of thing."
But then I thought, my favorite way of editing this very podcast when it's my turn, you know,
as we alternate, I thought, I like to prop this up
with one hand and use my other hand with the pencil.
This is not gonna be as feasible.
I'm gonna have all this extra screen real estate
for more wrist fatigue when holding my iPad.
So it was 11.
- I will say that that center stage thing though,
it's very, it's not something you would think
you'd care about, but it's pretty dang cool
when you're on a call with somebody that has it.
It doesn't really do you a damn bit of good
having it on your iPad.
But for the people that you're talking to,
I think it's quite cool having it work,
especially when there's multiple people.
So if you're doing like some kind of call with family
or something, I guess, it's cool how,
when people come in and out and it just,
it's very magical feeling how well it seems to know
what it's doing in terms of getting everyone
and then one person and then coming back out, it very much feels like there's a little,
there's a little tiny camera person inside the camera directing and calling the shot,
like making its own little movie out of whatever it's seeing.
It's very cool.
Well, I look forward to using it with people and telling them that's exactly what's happening.
And you should find, and judging by the Apple promotion as well, it actually will make your teeth whiter.
It'll give you a great kitchen.
You'll always have some fresh fruit right on hand.
And a cute little kid would just keep wandering in, you know, to help you enjoy your perfect life.
Yeah, it's very cool.
I think when Jason saw it, when I was using it, mine, um, I did have the cute little kid, although he was not quite so true.
Rubik, he was kind of annoying and I think kept wanting to bite into the conversation.
You know, you work with what you've got.
He had lots of questions that day.
Yeah.
But tell you what, sure worked nicely.
It never, never once.
I mean, I don't have hours of use with this thing, but from every call I've been on with
various people, it's never done anything that was jarring or weird that took you out of
the conversation.
Everything was always fluid, smooth, and it never seemed to be like, "Oh, I'm going to
focus on this clock that's on the wall."
It looks kind of like a face.
It's pretty impressive because it even seems to pan up and down, right?
It goes, zooms in and out and it goes up and down,
but all in a very smooth, like it's on a gimbal.
I almost feel like a camera on a gimbal.
It's really nice.
(upbeat music)
- Now I'm looking at the topic pool,
bit of a big topic, emphasis on the word big.
Jason, you've put down something about email
in parentheses, all caps, big mail.
What do you have to say?
- So yes and no.
I did put something in the notes titled something about email.
That is all I put. I had put nothing about big mail.
I believe my note was sabotaged. Um, so,
uh, what I was going to actually talk about with email was a while back I did
the whole thing of consolidating,
deleting email addresses and getting everything to kind of funnel into my fast
So I just had one account, right?
So all these email apps, you can add multiple accounts to them.
We've all used all of them.
They all have pros and cons, mostly cons.
Except BigMail.
BigMail has no pros, just cons.
That's true.
But all I was going to say was after consolidating all this down to having only one email address
now, I went after my crisis/crushing my feelings when I used Big Mail that I had been looking
forward to for so long and then used it and it just fell down in every possible way.
I went back through the rotation of all the other email apps just for fun, you know, as
you do. And I found that many of them were much better when you only add a single email
account. I know for me personally, uh, airmail was one that I always had issues with. It
always just seemed real buggy. Good thing would do weird stuff. Perfectly fine when
I only put one email address in there. I don't know. I'm I'm I feel like email works. Email
apps seem to work better when you don't add 15 different accounts to them. In hindsight,
I guess that's probably makes sense.
I think whoever added big mail to my topic list...
Who would do that, really?
I can't imagine.
I'll just say things are not going well in the big mail arena right now or ever.
It launched with much anticipation, crushed any hopes you had immediately.
It was like the Fyre Festival for email, wasn't it?
It really, yeah, I feel terrible for that person that made that because they made a
brilliant website.
They were very good at saying what this was going to do.
Then the app happened and it was like a whole being on a different planet.
And even still, I think they must have changed something server side because I had to be
clear I did not buy it.
I did the two week trial and was thankful that the two week trial existed because which
Which also made me think, I wonder if there's a way for people to reset their trials as
a developer, because I really feel like they need to get to a point where it actually works
and be able to say, "Hey, here's another to try it for real this time."
Because once you've burned the two-week trial, the only way to try it again is to just pay
the full $80 or whatever, which $80 is fine if it actually does something.
But I've noticed now you can use to launch it and it would say, "Your trial's up.
Here's how to renew," or whatever.
Now it just opens up the app and you can seemingly use it, I think.
Maybe this is a bug, but I imagine they must have changed something so people could at
least kind of see if it's working for them at all.
Which for me, it's not.
On every device, it just crashes on launch, regardless of if it's a beta OS or not.
my iMac's not a beta and it just opens, spins a little bit and then crashes. So...
You just sticking with the normal mail app now?
Oh no, I just, I've been using airmail everywhere and it's been fine. I quite enjoy it. But yeah,
big mail, man, what a, it's such a disappointment in every respect. And I really just feel bad
because I don't know, I think it's like one person that's making it. And I just don't know
how you went from like what the website showed to what was launched.
Sad, sad, sad story because it's at this point, I don't know how you,
how you come back from this, even if it's, if you know, six months from now,
it's the quote perfect app.
There's going to be a lot of people need to write blog posts about why it's now
good or something,
or there's gonna be a very big media push to get this back into anyone's vision
because it's it at this point,
It's long forgotten and I don't think anyone even talks about it anymore except for literally me right now
Now that we've addressed email I want to turn to a topic that's in the topic pool which I'm not even sure I want to
hear about
But the way that it's written now, I'm just teasing you Andrew because I know it's yours
Oh, but but the way that it's written is probably my favorite
Note that's ever been added as a topic
I'm just gonna read it out for our listeners to see how it's been written and see if you can make sense of what's
happening goodbye Devin think and residual basketball emoji to denote that
it's his topic - hello ellipsis finder question mark open parentheses plus
indexing closed parentheses or yo Jimbo three question marks what's going on
here there's a lot cycling through my brain it was like a whole flow of
consciousness that just kind of came out in a keyboard I was happy I'm having a
crisis of confidence. Devon Think, my trusty sidekick for so long, I suddenly
realized it's bloody annoying. It kind of somehow deleted all the files in my work
OneDrive twice, which was okay because not only did I have a million like
backups, but OneDrive does have a really nice feature where it sends you an email
and says like, do you realize you've just deleted three gigabytes worth of files?
Would you like to really do that? They're in the recycle bin if you'd like to
restore them. Yes, thank you OneDrive. That's a good feature. iCloud you could
learn from a thing or two from that. Devonthink, and I just realized there's a
lot of faffing around with Devonthink. A lot of overhead for managing files. I
still think it has a place for managing like research and knowledge, PDF
documents that I've collected over time that are helpful in like my know-how and my knowledge.
I still find value in using it for that.
But for managing working documents, it's just too... it's silly.
It's silly.
So I think I'm saying goodbye to Devonthink.
And the Devonthink to-go app on iOS is just... they keep updating it and it's just horrible.
I hate it so much.
I hate it.
Sinks it spends about 3 hours sinking to before you can do anything and then you just keep getting sink errors and that's what's funny and I was finding I had sink errors between my,
2 computers and I just couldn't rely on it and like everything did to me right so I need to find a new solution.
Because I need a solution right and always need us got out of that solution.
And I put it I put it to my my to esteemed co-host and said what do I do and Martin just came back and said use finder.
Which is the most pathetic week answer if I don't want to find her what am I doing like why would I use finder.
After you've labeled my advice pathetic let's find out why it's pathetic.
So I knew I knew there was there was hope there was still hope for me because I knew at the time that I asked the question that Jason was asleep and I knew that he would come to my rescue with a much more interesting answer than use finder.
What do you do when he finally popped up at his head comes off the pillow he says.
You find it it's what it's for you trying to do you're trying to find stuff who's good at that finder.
Folders with files in them like my favorite parties PDFs that represent my knowledge of years of blah blah blah it's like the PDFs go in the finder and then if you want to find them.
That's where you find use the final even use spotlight and use the finder and you can search the titles of the terms of hell you can use Alfred if you want but they're in the finder there in the finder.
But it doesn't tell you anything that's related to the document that you're looking at at that
point in time. Which in terms of knowledge management is really helpful. You can say,
"Oh there's another document article that relates to the thing that I'm looking at now.
Let me cross over to that and see if I can learn a little bit more." I love that about Devon Think.
Right? You're never going to convince me otherwise on that. But okay, managing files. So what I've
I've done, I've gone to find her.
But there's still a problem.
The ephemeral bits and pieces that you collect over time,
the things that come your way that you wanna capture
and you just don't want,
like where do I create a finder folder
called miscellaneous or ephemera?
What do I do, right?
Stupid, I need someone to put that stuff.
- Can you describe or explain what one of these pieces
ephemera might be and we'll actually conclude whether it needs to go anywhere
okay well that's a little bit of a problem because I don't have a good
example of what that stuff is but I'm sure I come across it I'm sure I collect
stuff because you know like an electricity bill finder so I have a
folder called it bills not even that one folder called paper archive sure right
and that goes in there and guess guess how many times you're gonna go back and
Look at that bill literally zero.
What about the size of my pet?
What about the note denoting the size of my pants?
Notes, not notes.
The app, just a note place.
What a folder called notes.
No, a note app.
There you go.
Thank you.
And no tap.
Yes.
So I need a note app, a shoe box app, a bits and pieces app.
No, there's one called notes and you don't need to find another one.
I keep everything in one box.
That one box has four corners.
To do-y things, craft things, calendar things, finder.
If it's a file, finder.
If it's something that needs to happen
at its specific time and date, calendar.
If it's text/images/notes, craft.
If it's a thing I need to get done by a certain time,
things, done.
- So boring.
It's called sensible and efficient.
(laughing)
See, this is why, if you're talking about ephemera,
this is why I quite like TOT, right?
And I know people went, "Oh, it's like TOT came out
and everyone jumped on the bandwagon."
I like TOT because if I'm quickly taking a note down
of something that's happening during a work meeting
or something that I don't want to forget,
I just drop it into one of those seven little sheets
and then decide what to do with it.
If it's important, I keep it and I file it somewhere
or put it in a document in the Finder or whatever.
- Not a Word document, I hope.
- No, no, no, not Word document, just a document.
- He takes all his work notes in PowerPoint,
like everyone else that takes notes.
- Aren't all your documents in landscape orientation?
That's the future.
- Why is that a thing?
I don't get it.
That's so common that people will sit there
and take notes in a sideways PowerPoint document.
Why are you doing that to yourself?
- I don't know.
It's atrocious.
But yeah, no, that's it.
So you put it somewhere, just drop it in.
And then if it's important,
you keep it and do something with it,
or you get rid of it.
If it's kind of oxymoronic to say
that you need to keep ephemera somewhere.
- Can I present to you my final option?
- Post-its.
- No, you read it in the note,
Yojimbo from the fine folk at Bare Bones.
All right, so I purchased a version two of Yojimbo.
Yojimbo in about 2009 and then I upgraded to version 3 in about 2010. I know this because
I've got my license keys in one password. I can upgrade Yojimbo to version 4.6 I think they're up
to now for 20 US dollars. So I reinstalled Yojimbo and had a look at it and it was
kind of hadn't changed a bit and the introductory note still referred to iPhoto. Good memories,
I'd be keeping it for that and I've discovered a couple of bugs that I've sent into the bare-bones folks and they're looking into it
Seems to be m1. They're onto it. We've exchanged some emails
I'm providing them helpful helpful detail about the buggy issues. I'm discovering. Mm-hmm, but it is cozy
Okay, does it solve your iOS and iPad OS compatibility issues? Oh, it's good. It's got it
It's got a really um so it's got an iPad only app.
Oh, Yojimbo to go.
Yes and it's you load it up.
Is it called that?
No, I was just trolling.
I was like wait isn't the other one called that?
I think it's called Yojimbo for iPad.
I loaded it up on my 11 inch iPad and it sort of loaded into that sort of uh I haven't really seen it in anywhere else.
But basically almost like a 9.7 inch iPad window.
So it's so it's kind of like like it has never been upgraded to.
Fit the screen resolution of a more modern iPad like when you load an iPhone app and it's like yeah and then you can like yeah.
Yeah but you can't see can expand it right so it's not really it's not really and you can only read it's only a reader app you can't edit it on iPad.
So doesn't sound like it actually solves literally any of the problems that you were having.
No but it's called your Jimbo and you know it's it looks nice and it sinks well between the two Macs.
So does it achieve your primary business objectives and overarching macro desires for connected knowledge management.
No but it's a place I can shove stuff.
So it's really more about shoving the stuff than actually doing anything useful with it.
Yeah yeah I just don't like finder folders that are called miscellaneous and.
No one told you to make that.
No I don't think it comes by default with that.
I need to find more like minded people because you two suck.
I think you just need to come to the realization that these tools are not the correct tools for the job.
This to craft craft is still good can you show stuff in craft you can shove anything you want there.
Okay maybe i need to explore i've been thinking about craft is like a very formal place to put things maybe i can shove stuff in there.
Hey have you guys ever been to a conference online.
Yes, normally they're not very fun. What if there were a conference online that was fun?
Really? Could that be a thing? It could be and it's happening this Friday August 13th and Saturday August 14th or
Saturday and Sunday depending on where you are in relation to that imaginary line that goes down that we call the date line
Yeah, it's called micro camp. I don't know if you've heard of it. It's part of micro blog
It's going to be happening over the course of two days. There will be I believe 16
presenters
From across all walks of life within the micro blog community. It's open to everyone
You don't even have to know what a micro blog is or what a blog is
You don't have to know anything and it's free you just go and click the button and sign up and then you're there
So, I mean, I don't know what's better than that learning new knowledge from people across the globe for free
Come on, take that masterclass.
So yeah, check it out.
Micro camp, go to micro.camp and check it out.
And weirdly enough, there may be a live podcast taking place at that very conference.
Don't know much more about it other than that, but I would check it out.
Do you know what I love about this?
Besides the fact that micro.blog is fantastic and I'm looking forward to the event itself,
The fact that this very live recording that you're describing will be our first ever attempt
at such a thing.
So it could be a roaring success or it could be an utter failure.
Flaming disaster.
And we'll be mocked openly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There'll be many micro.blog posts about the embarrassment that was Hemispheric Views Live
at MicroCamp.
So I think that's a great reason for people to sign up, either to celebrate in our victory
or to watch us crash and burn.
Yeah.
It's either a milestone or the last episode of the show ever.
We were talking about One Prime Plus member Gabrielle last episode and talking about his
accent and I attempted to replicate it.
Did not go well.
Did not go well.
Fortunately we've avoided any diplomatic issues arising.
He hasn't left yet.
No, he hasn't.
He actually went so far as to help us out and provided audio content of how he should
Actually say it right
Which I think we may just drop into this episode
right
Now guys it is supposed to be
Gabrielle and you need to do this handshake like you're holding an apple, but no apple in your hand of course
As you say the name
Yeah, he sounds significantly less Italian than you suggested Andrew. Yeah, it turns out whenever I try and do an accent
It just turns into Italian
Mamma Mia, that's it. Yeah, funnily enough. He does use both his name and his accent better than I do
Who would have thought what that's bizarre. I can't believe that
Jason you've asked us a little bit about things like hot sauce right different foods different attitudes. I
Want to know how familiar you are as an American with a thing called Rocky Road
Rocky Road ice cream Rocky Road ice cream, but are you familiar with Rocky Road on its own?
Is that a thing in the United States? I know I don't think so. Can I have some context please?
Can you use it in a sentence?
It's like a spelling bee. Jeez. I really enjoyed that rocky road from Daryl Lee not a sponsor. Daryl Lee you nailed it man
Thank you
Jason's looking very confused
Often known as Rock Lee Road as well. Oh, it's so good
Okay, now that we've completely confused you Jason. What is Rocky Road ice cream to you? I actually don't know
I just know it's a kind of ice cream with a bunch of crap in it. It's like vanilla ice cream with a
Random stuff in it. I don't actually know what's in it
See, this is a fascinating example where America is like candy capital of the world
You've got everything mushed together
You've got aisles and aisles of you know
Sugar with sugar on it and then extra sugar just in case you missed the first two layers, right?
And then this wonderful Australian invention by Darrell Lee, which is like a particular Australian
You know chocolate and snack company it's proliferated through other companies this is thing called rocky road and it's essentially chocolate
With and correct me along the way if I stuff it up Andrew, but you've got
Marshmallows in it. Oh, yeah, you've got peanuts in it. Mm-hmm
There's is there coconut sometimes you can throw it in. It's like it's like a coconut raffle most that goes through it
Yeah, and different versions or takes on Turkish delight. Hmm and
And it's called Rocky Road because when you actually have it all out as a slab, it looks like very poorly laid brown bitumen, but it tastes delicious.
And if you have the Daryl Lee version, which is the, it's so delicious.
Everything about it is just amazing.
The chocolate is perfect.
The marshmallow is fluffy and flavoursome and delicious.
It just and the coconut if I will I could I could just keep on eating that Daryl a rocky road
forever with the exception of the coconut that
Does vaguely sound like what is in Rocky Road ice cream?
So I do believe they are related, but I don't think there's ever a coconut in it
Well, it's interesting to me that the ice cream would be a vanilla base
Now I'm gonna I got to look it up actually because now I'm can I know people are gonna yell at me. Oh
Yep, it's chocolate ice cream. First of all
There we go. It's completely wrong there
Comes from Oakland, California right near where I used to live. There you go. So really I should know everything about it
chocolate flavored
different
composed of chocolate ice cream
Nuts, so peanuts that that could be it and a whole or diced marshmallows
Oh, that's it chocolate ice cream marshmallows and nuts no mention of Turkish delight or rose water
Okay, well it's delicious, and I'm glad that you support it so much Andrew particularly the Daryl Lee thing
But I have to ask you as another layer because I think given how much I just confused Jason about rocky road in general
Sorry Jason
The musk stick Andrew do you like musk sticks? I certainly did I don't know if there'd be right up my alley anymore
When I was a kid, I would I would eat the heck out of a musk stick
Yeah, this is like a candy cigarette
Nah, you could use it that way but imagine something that tastes like delicious soap and
It's pink. It tastes pink. I introduced the Germans I used to work to to these and they thought what the hell are you eating?
It was the same as when again we had Germans over because you know, I know Germans
And they saw the green cordial that you made fun of me for drinking a number of episodes ago
And they said why do you have palm olive in the fridge and I said it's not palm olive. It's
Green lime cooler cordial same thing about the musk stick and they were just saying why the hell
Do you keep eating things that taste like detergent? Is this one of those like generic really chalky kind of shitty candies that
Could be in any shape or no. No, no. No, it's not that no
What you want and you if they've been sitting in the shop shelf for too long
They might go a bit hard you want them when they're just a little bit soft. I think from memory
I think that Roman just one of just a little bit. Yeah. Yeah a little bit soft not not dried out entirely
Oh, those look those look horrific. They're delicious. I love them. It looks like
Extruded bubble gum that didn't get to the last process of turning into gum
It was just like a few steps shy and they're like here you go
Is it chewy?
Kinda they're sugary and look this is the thing that'll probably turn people off entirely particularly if you're vegan or vegetarian
As far as I'm aware, I don't think there are any alternatives to this but generally the red dye
That comes out in any lollies or sweets or candy, whatever you want to call it comes from the crushing of a red beetle
So you're actually eating crushed up beetles to make the color that adds to the pink of the musk stick
So if you didn't want to try them before you probably don't want to try them now, but they are delicious
I endorse the beetles stick
