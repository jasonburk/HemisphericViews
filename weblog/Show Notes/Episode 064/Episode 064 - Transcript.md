So how did the internet come back was it actually properly fixed you had to get out there and like do some fiber optic repair work yourself.
- Cool, okay, yeah, so I told the horror story last time,
so I will give the recap of how we're back in action now
and how I've over-engineered a backup for this whole thing.
So this happened back, whatever it was,
July something or other,
and it was gonna be like almost two weeks, right,
until we got somebody to come out and fix this thing.
And so we had nothing for a while.
We did tethering with our phones for a while,
which worked pretty good,
but you can imagine tethering all day
is not super great, right?
It's like, it works, but your phone gets incredibly hot.
A phone is not meant to tether for like an eight hour period.
It's just not.
It's for like little bits and pieces here or there.
So then we went out and got the T-Mobile home 5G thing.
It's like a big black box thing that you plug in.
It gets 5G, spits out wifi or ethernet,
and it's phenomenal.
It's a really great, if that were my only option,
it wouldn't be as great as the fiber,
but it's pretty damn good.
It's unlimited, it's fairly inexpensive,
so it's kind of like a giant hotspot,
but plugged into your house.
So we got that, and we'd been using that for a while.
Then the person finally came out to fix the fiber,
which had been like, it was like a holiday.
Like the countdown to this day could not come soon enough.
And there was then also the fear of like, what if they don't come?
Then what happens? What if they can't fix it? What do we do?
So there's a little bit of excitement, fear, panic,
all wrapped up into one nice neat package.
They show up I'm excited and they're like, how you doing? I'm like,
fantastic. Now that you're here, like let's get this done.
And he goes and looks and like, yeah, this truck thing happened. He's like, Oh
yeah, truck thing. And I'm like, this, like this, this just happens.
Like this is a thing you've heard of. He said it like it's common. Yeah.
Like, Oh, yeah. He's like, Oh, I think he even said like something about a trash
truck. And I was like, this is normal. Like how is this normal? Okay.
And so I showed him where it, where it was before. And he's like, Oh yeah.
And I was like, yeah, we made it two years. And he was like,
you made it two years with where it was like giving,
Alluding to the fact that the last person that installed it did a horrible job.
Oh, really? Like it was in the firing line of a truck.
It was like just not, yeah, high enough at all.
He's, I'm amazed.
Right.
He thought it had been there for like two weeks and someone took it out.
And I was like, okay, anyway.
So he jumps up there.
He's doing wires.
He's doing this.
He's doing that.
He reroutes the thing to a whole different angle of attack and it's way better now.
And he's done in like 15 minutes,
which is both like impressive and annoying that it took two weeks to have
somebody come on for 15 minutes. But okay, sure. Here, that's where we're at.
So he does the whole thing and then he goes and he takes out all the old lines
and everything and then leaves. And I was like, is there anything I need to do?
He's like, nah, once I get it hooked up, it'll just kick back on.
So as he's working,
I have like my little command center up and I'm watching all the,
all the stuff in the dashboard of our network.
And I see it click on and things start moving in there.
I'm like, "Oh, it's back!"
It was like-- - Finally.
(laughing)
- The second coming of internet is here.
And so that happened and I immediately started
doing speed tests just to make sure, you know,
make sure I'm getting what I'm supposed to be getting
and everything looks good.
And slowly everything in the house
starts coming back to life.
The things that haven't had internet for two weeks
start working again and it was glorious.
So now I've got the 5G thing plugged in as a second WAN
into our network as a failover.
So fiber ever goes down,
it immediately seamlessly kicks over to the 5G,
same network, nothing changes from a device perspective.
- Why am I not surprised?
- And it's pretty great.
Do we need it?
Hell no, we don't.
Do we have it?
Yes.
You might just be killing your internet for fun to test the system.
I haven't yet, but I'm going to.
I'm going to test the failover to make sure that we're in good standing.
But everything, from a technical standpoint, looks like a go.
But I'm assuming that you have a test, which is much safer.
Like you're not actually going to go and hire a garbage truck and drive it straight into
your fiber optic cable to simulate the experience.
No, if it were less than two weeks to get someone out here, maybe.
Just to do the full disaster recovery scenario.
Because you want to test as real to life as you can, right?
In this case, I'll probably just unplug the ethernet and then plug it back in.
That's as close as we're getting to doomsday here.
Actually, I have a question about garbage trucks where you are, because whenever I've seen
an American film or TV show, there is always someone hovering or holding onto the back of
the garbage truck to step off and scoop up the bin and load it into the back. Is that actually
still a thing. And I ask that because here in Australia, when a garbage truck goes past,
there may be one or two people in the front of the truck, but generally there's a big automated
crane arm that comes and scoops up the bin. What do you have?
So here we have that scenario where it is a single person in the truck and they have the arm that
comes out the side and scoops it over or they get out and grab the little bin and throw it in.
As far as the whole like stereotypical 80s movies, two guys hanging off the back kind of thing.
Yeah.
I'm curious if that still exists maybe in like big cities where the arm thing doesn't really work
because there's just thousands of cars down the streets and trash cans are sort of wherever and
people need to just be able to go and grab them. So maybe in like a New York type situation that
might still be a thing.
Right.
But I think the majority is probably more the arm thing and then they just come and
And it picks up the bin, throws it over, and then they throw it back on the ground and leave.
Right. Yeah. I kind of thought that it might be like an old movie thing from the 80s or the 90s, and that it wouldn't be like that today.
But then I was thinking, and we were fortunate when we visited New York City, that it wasn't like this different time of year.
But that whole rubbish all over the footpath slash sidewalk thing, how the hell would an arm actually
- Collect all of that?
- And with that many people,
like you probably end up killing more people with the arm
than actually collecting trash.
- Exactly, yeah, you just like mow down all these people
with a gigantic arm.
Oops, here are the casualties for today
because of the garbage arm.
- Yeah, and I think in the movies too,
somehow the trash truck was always like a plot point too.
Something got thrown in the trash and they had to go get it
or someone ended up in the trash
or they're hiding something in the,
like there was always a plot point.
So that's probably part of why they had that.
- Was that a big deal in the US?
Lots of people went missing
because they accidentally climbed into the garbage trucks.
- I mean, that's kind of always the thing, right?
Is that the waste management is run by like the mob, so.
- What a convenient system.
Now, something's just occurred to me.
Is someone missing?
- Let me check.
I don't, no, this seems pretty normal.
Usually it's, let's see.
- Yeah, it's pretty natural.
We're recording Hemispheric Views,
the premier Australian NBL coverage podcast
where we talk about financial advice in the stock market.
So yeah, I think it's usually just you and me
talking about that 'cause that's our expertise.
- Bit of FinTech, bit of agriculture.
- Yeah.
No, of course not, we are missing somebody.
- Yes.
- Who is it?
Is it Nick Tan?
- Eric.
- Oh, Eric.
Oh yeah, Eric.
was here last week. We've got the Davids. We've got a bunch of- oh it's that Andrew guy,
the business. Andrew Xmouth.
That's where he is. Xsmith? Xmouth.
I keep wanting to say Xsmith but he says Xmouth. Yeah, I was curious about that because I don't
think I've actually heard it till I just said it out loud and then it sounded wrong.
I feel like it would be Xsmith. Yeah, like Plymouth.
Yeah. Hmm.
But you're saying it's actually Xmouth? Well that's what I've heard him say.
Anyway, I think for listeners benefit, I'll stop trash talking now. Andrew is on holiday in a place
called X-Mouth, or X-Mouth, which to me, if it is X-Mouth sounds funny, because if he's not on the
podcast, that means that he is an X-Mouth and can actually use his voice. He is the X-Mouth.
But yeah, I hope you're having a good time in X-Mouth/X-Mouth, Andrew. And look, let's be
honest, if you've listened to all of Hemispheric Views listeners, which frankly, I think some
people have actually gone back through the archive, which kind of flabbergasts me, you would
know that we have not had an episode of Hemispheric Views where there hasn't been all three of us.
And this time coming up to the Sunday that Andrew and I share Saturday for Jason, when we record
this, Andrew's on holiday. And he said, guys, I don't know if I'm going to be able to record.
And Jason said that is unacceptable. That does not happen on this podcast. But where he is,
apparently has internet that is inferior to gong net, which is a very big concern.
So we couldn't guarantee that the listening experience would be perfect for all of you
hemispherians. So the solution that I came up with a very risky one, Jason,
I'm sure you were having palpitations as I was after I suggested that.
I still am.
because we don't know. We did not know what was going to happen. I said to Andrew, look,
to ensure that you're on the episode, but you don't have these connection issues,
I'm going to give you the license to talk for up to about 10 minutes about whatever you want,
probably about business we don't know. And we're just going to include it in the show.
Whatever you want to talk about, Andrew, that you would normally filter or have to rein in,
because we don't care. You can now do it. Now, Jason, just to confirm,
We did not know what he was going to do.
I still don't. I didn't listen to it.
But you haven't listened to it?
No, no. I'm going in completely blind.
Well, I had a bit of a listen just to make sure that it was appropriate for
this because you never know. Andrew could go completely rogue.
He could. Yeah.
Otherwise, this is a total surprise and we don't know what's going to happen.
And let's just treat this as a chapter mark of everyone to skip if they don't care
about what Andrew has to say.
And we are being mean. It's probably interesting.
So do we want to throw that in like now?
Yeah, maybe you do one of those little three two one
Goes that you do when we actually start and that'll give everyone enough warning to hit that skip button if they wish
All right. Here we go. So I'm gonna I'm gonna pass it off to our correspondent in the field in X mouth
I'm gonna pass it over to him to hear what's going on from a
insert name of topic standpoint in three two one
Go hello hemispherians. This is Andrew Canyon with a special edition of
business corner
Today I'm here to talk to you about lean manufacturing and that little tune there that I played
That is something that you will hear across factories in Japan if you go there to study lean manufacturing
As well as hearing it in factories, you'll hear it in train stations other public centers
basically anywhere where
They need to get your attention
But not blast you with an emergency warning sound
that's the interesting thing about Japanese factories as
As much as something can go wrong, you will never hear the cacophony of a warning klaxon.
They'll play, machines when they break, they'll play instead little tunes like that.
And every machine has its own tune. So people working on the factory floor understand,
oh there's a problem with the press machine. Oh the drill kit is not working because it's
playing its particular music. It's a more relaxing, sympathetic way of creating an
environment on a factory workshop floor which communicates something but doesn't
create angst amongst employees. Because one of the things about lean is it's
about having an empathy for the person. As much as we talk about it being a
factory production method it really is ultimately about empowering people and
and empathizing with people and giving them the opportunity to create a workplace where
they can be happy and productive.
There's a few principles about lean that are pretty obvious and some of you who are in
the tech sector, a lot of this will sound familiar, particularly if you come across
agile development, scrum, those sorts of things, because really that's an offshoot of lean.
And Lean dates back to the 1950s.
Taichi Yono and Deming from America, he couldn't get traction for this philosophy in America.
So after World War II and Japan was rebuilding its nation after being decimated, they were
looking for any ideas to create an industry sector.
So Deming went over there, partnered up with Taichi Yono and so on, and built these principles
of lean which are now circulating around the world, whether it's lean, agile, what have
you, it's happening.
There's some basic lean principles.
It's about elimination of waste, respect for people, as I spoke about already, and continuous
improvement.
See, one of the things to remember is all work is a process.
All processes have waste and they can be improved.
The lean is about engaging people to remove waste and create value for customers.
Customers don't want to pay for wasteful products when they buy something, they want to pay
for the product.
So any waste that you can remove reduces the cost of building the thing and you can either
increase your own profit margins or reduce the cost for the customer.
It provides a way for the business to do more with less while getting closer to that ideal
delivering the perfect product for customers. Now one of the things in our little world is Apple.
Apple is a classic company in terms of lean. If you look at the way they manufacture, they will
use lean manufacturing principles in their chip plants, in their manufacturing profiles and
processes to build the iPhones. So it is all relevant to us and we are all beneficiaries of
that. It's not just about the Toyota production system, although they are the
poster child for Lean having been the ones who have worked on it the most. But
now other car companies as well like Kia and Hyundai, they're all copying the
same methods. And in fact Tesla needs to work on that a little bit more I think.
Lean in Japan, it's embedded in the organizational culture, it's embraced at
all levels and it's used to empower staff and build workplace pride. You will see lean
in a good company, it's well implemented, it's occurring at every level, whether that's
the workshop floor, middle management, senior management. It's indoctrinated in the company
as a way of working. Now I've mentioned a few times already the
The idea of waste and eliminating waste.
There are only seven wastes that we need to worry about.
And these can be acronymized, is that the word?
Anyway, you can build an acronym, TIMWOOD.
If you want to remember seven wastes, remember TIMWOOD.
You have transportation, inventory, motion, weighting, over-processing, over-production,
and defects.
time you're creating one of those wastes you need to eliminate it and you need to eliminate
it at the source. Don't wait to build the product get to the end of it and then have
a QA at the department, identify a problem and then have to deconstruct it or remedy
it at that point. If there's a problem stop what you're doing fix it then and there. It's
cheaper and you're not embedding more waste in the process and then having to re-engineer
things later. Deal with it when the problem occurs. If you want to start a lean effort in your
workplace or your home you can do so. It's really easy and this is where I'm going to finish today's
business corner section. Okay this is a takeaway for you to go and apply. In fact I challenge you
go into your laundry and see how you can apply some of the 5S principles in that room.
Laundry, it's a small room, there's not much going on. You're washing some clothes, maybe you're
drying some clothes, maybe you're folding some clothes, maybe you're putting away some towels.
There's not much going on in the laundry but you'll be kept busy with 5S principles in there
for a little while. But at the end of it, if you do it well, you'll end up with a much more
functional workspace and it will be a great example of implementing 5S anywhere. So the
first one in 5S and I'm going to give you the English version not the Japanese words for this
because they're easier for me to say. You have sorting, straightening, shining, standardizing
and sustaining. So the first one sorting, separate necessary, occasional and unnecessary items
and don't have anything in there that you don't need.
So sort it out.
Get rid of the old cleaning agents you don't use anymore.
Have you got a random pillowcase that doesn't match?
Get rid of it.
That's throwing away, tidying up, sorting out.
That's what you're trying to do.
Consider this the KonMari step.
Does it give you joy?
If not, thank it and get rid of it.
The next one is straightening.
So lining things up, keep things fronted, think about a supermarket shelf.
They straighten the labels, they front up, it's very easy to find what you're looking
for.
You want that same thing in your laundry.
Don't have things stacked up behind one another so you can't find them.
Everything needs to be visible.
And by having gotten rid of a bunch of stuff in the first step, it'll be easier to achieve.
The next step, shining.
This is about wiping down and keeping things clean.
You know what's great about keeping things clean?
Is it helps maintenance.
If you keep things clean, you'll notice, perhaps, if you wipe down the washing machine, you'll
notice if it stays dry, you'll notice if it suddenly springs a leak, because there's water
coming out.
Or if there's a leak in the tap, if you wipe down the tap, and next time you look at the
tap, there's a bit of water on it, you think, "Hmm, that doesn't look right."
If you don't keep things clean and wipe down, you don't know what normal looks like, so
don't have an opportunity to spot the problem. So that's shining. The next step
standardizing. You need to maintain that standard. Don't let it slip. So when you
go in there you sort of finish the job. Don't leave things in a half-done state.
If you started folding the laundry finish folding the laundry. If you're
putting clothes away put them all away. Don't leave half a pile there. Trying to
keep the workplace clean and maintain that standard so it's accessible for everybody.
The last step, and this is the hard one, sustaining it.
It's really easy to do this for a week maybe, but how about a month, six months?
What happens if your kids go into the laundry?
Are they aware of the new standards that's been set?
Have you communicated what those standards are all about and what is expected?
Is there an agreement?
So basically you're trying to maintain that momentum and keep that laundry as a functional
workplace in your home.
Now take that laundry example, have a go at it, let us know how you get on, tell us about
it in the discord.
I'm curious to know, was it challenging?
Was it easy?
Did you learn any lessons?
Is there anything you can take from that and apply to your own workplace or apply it to
the kitchen?
The thing is, with lean, it's a process that is never ending.
Plan do check adjust.
It's a cycle that carries on.
You will always find new ways to optimize.
Toyota has been optimizing for 60 or 70 years now and they don't consider themselves anywhere
near done.
I imagine Apple think the same way about the way they manufacture iPhones.
So for you, the way you optimize your laundry, you'll do a bit first, but then you'll find
another way to do it better. This has been Andrew Canyon with Business Corner, a special
episode of Hemispheric Views and a special portion. I really hope you've enjoyed it and
that you've gotten something from this today. I certainly know I've enjoyed bringing it
to you.
we're back. Wow. That was riveting.
I don't even have words to describe what we just heard from Andrew out in Xmouth.
That is both fascinating and intriguing.
So thank you for that, Andrew.
We appreciate you taking the time out of your busy snorkeling beach life.
Is it me or is he on vacation just kind of constantly though?
Can we just get that out of the way real quick? Cause I feel like,
It's kind of just one big vacation over there at Canyon HQ.
I agree. And there was an iMessage that he sent to us about how he hadn't yet
spotted George Clooney. So there may be yachts.
There's probably some sort of golf course or blazer club situation happening
over there.
Yeah, probably.
You know, the places where they give you a coat if you don't have one.
Yeah. But I mean, it's him. So he's obviously going to have like three coats.
He's probably wearing a tie while snorkeling.
Yeah. You know how they have like the silverware laid out on like big fancy
meals and you have like different sets of silverware for each part.
He has like multiple jackets on.
So like there's like the appetizer jacket and then that comes off and then
there's like the main course jacket and then that comes off and it's just like,
it's just nested jackets all the way down for him.
Do you reckon at least one of them has like mega shoulder pads,
like channeling some sort of 90 situation?
I think it probably has to, right? Cause it's like the backup one for if you,
if, if all of a sudden the conversation shifts to like, you know,
90s finance, he just boom, he's in the mode already.
He's ready.
He can just dive right in and he plays the part. Everybody like, he's convincing because he's got
the pad. So, yeah, I think that's probably part of it.
I reckon he also has an entire collection of shoes that at the ready he can turn to when the trend
turns to rounded, square or pointy. You know how dress shoes just go through that ridiculous
arbitrary cycle of how pointy your shoe is. Anyway, I reckon he's ready for that too.
And look, I mean, that's Business Corner. And I know in his parlance, there would be a lot of key
takeaways and learnings that we can use for our own betterment. And I hope you enjoyed it,
Hemispherians. Thank you, Andrew. We hope you're back in two weeks time.
Now we have a new patron. A new one.
For oneprimeplus.com.
One prime plus.com is where you go to become a patron of the Hemispheric Views
podcast, where you get hopefully less of business corner, but we don't know.
We'll see if you want more, we'll give you more in one prime plus.
You just have to request it.
That's the beauty of one prime plus is you, you all basically run the show.
Um, you get to pick whatever you want us to talk about, write about, chat about.
It's up to you.
That's why you're there.
So one prime plus.com this week brings us Zachary B.
So thank you Zachary or Zach or however you prefer to be called.
I'll go with Zachary because that was in the message. Thank you for joining.
I'm going to go with Zach Meister.
Zach Meister could be one as well. Uh, sure. Why not?
He joined one prime plus and you can too at one prime plus.com.
You get bonus episodes, you get, I was going to say ad free.
It's like, yeah, of course we don't do ads.
You get the newsletter every month, which is coming up pretty soon for August.
And you get a really unlimited, a limited, unlimited number of things.
Right.
So the other thing we do is we do live watches of stuff.
So we do like a severance live watch.
We do movie live watches.
where we have commentary and we kind of just hang out together.
And there is the entire back catalog, which I mentioned to make sure,
make sure you go and get that if you've just joined.
And it's just a cool place to, Oh, also the discord,
which is like probably one of my favorite places on the internet these days is on
our hemisphere fused discord,
where we all chat about all kinds of things.
We're making new channels all the time. So, uh, yeah,
join that discord is for everybody, but there is a specific channel for one prime plussers
so that you can give us direct feedback or ask questions or give suggestions for things that
you would like us to chat about. And it's all in there. One prime plus dot com. Thank you,
Zachary B. Yes, thank you, Zachary. And I have to put this in. I have to acknowledge it just because
it was all about me and my great success. Ha ha. Episode the bonus episode for one prime plus in
July saw a massive challenge to Andrew's, well I think we've been quite mean to Andrew today, sorry,
his entire knowledge management system. So if you enjoy some of Andrew's meandering through his
business and knowledge management lifestyle and you'd like a bit of a hilarious moment that saw
him question his entire life philosophy, sign up and get that episode in the entire backlog,
the entire archive of bonus audio, and you'll get to get to enjoy that as much as I did.
Yes. So thank you, Zachary, once again, and anyone else, one prime plus dot com.
Can I shift focus quickly, Martin?
Of course, because I wanted to bring something up into the conversation.
Yes. That I think is both.
Oh, wait, hold on.
This just in.
We've just had an invader.
Hello. Is our foreign correspondent dialing in from the remote town
Slash place known as X mouth. Hello friends. It's lovely to join you here today
It is
Please keep going
All right. Well, I'm coming to you from the X mouth town center
I've just enjoyed my morning coffee
How are things on the ground there look it's it's very touristy I have to say
It's very country. There's a lot of a lack of Harvey is
but a
absolute surplus of mullets
mmm, I
You know take that as you will
I'm enjoying I've just had a coffee the bakery here is sensational highly recommended good, but the find the find of this
Adventure so far has been the fact that there are actually two IGA's in the town center
Unheard of can you elaborate on that for for listeners who may not be familiar with this terminology?
Yes, and the IGA is the independent grocers association. It's the
Independent it's like it's like your your your smaller version of Woolies or Coles and usually
Usually the town you'll find one of those
X-mouth for whatever bizarre reason actually has two on opposite sides of the very small mall Wow Wow
Wow, okay.
I mean, so your very expensive satellite connection is breaking up a little bit, but I think we're
getting the picture that although it seemed bleak upon your arrival, things are looking
average, currently.
Is that fair to say?
Yeah, that's a great way of putting it, Jason.
Once again, just cutting through to the nub of the issue.
Yeah, I just want to make sure.
Okay, so thank you so much for calling in.
We'll move on to the next caller now.
Next call. Thank you for calling. We appreciate your tote bag. The tote bag is in the mail
And I think we'll move on to the next caller
All right, I hope you have a uh recording of this because
Me and my iphone not recording anything
Oh perfect, then I think we absolutely do not so that is great
Yeah, well, and just if I can just interrupt for one further minute, because there is,
in Hemispheric Views News, Western Australia is a very large state. Australia is a very large
country. I am now at the northern, heading towards the northern end of Western Australia. So,
I'm actually closer to the northern hemisphere than I have been at any other point of making
this podcast. Wow.
So, you're verging on treason is what you're saying?
Yeah, what I'm realizing is we don't really have a one-time plus category for those on the equator.
So we need like an equatorial solution.
Is that really so common that someone's standing exactly on imaginary line?
I like to think so.
It's like, I reside purely over both sides of an imaginary line and require a membership tier for
a highly specific niche podcast that represents my geographical situation.
Think of all the sailors transiting the oceans listening to our podcast.
All the sailors.
All the equatorial guineas that could end up in our bank account.
Can you imagine how many sailors are listening to this right now? There must be
at least between zero and one, I would assume.
How many listeners do we have who are currently suffering scurvy? That's what I want to know.
Let us know on the Discord.
I can get them some fruit from either IGA.
Double IGA. You're here first, folks. If you're looking for a very specific place in Western
Australia towards the north side that encompasses two IGAs, X-Smith is where you want to be.
Can we get one final piece of clarification?
Can we get one piece of clarification before your satellite connection drops? Is it X-Mouth?
the end of the form attacked by seagulls or X-Men. I can hear them. It is X-Mouth. It is X-Mouth. Okay.
It was formerly a mouth. It's now no longer a mouth. It's an X-Mouth. Perfect. That makes that.
Does that make it the sphincter of Australia then? Oh. Don't tell the locals that.
They're already, they've already said. I was asking a question. It's up to you to answer it.
Well, they've already set the birds on me. So I'm not going to say yes to that one.
No, don't. We're going to need you to come. We wish you safe travels back to the mainland.
And we'll see you in two weeks. Should you be back?
I can't wait. I can't wait. I'm really delighted that I'm able to join just for a short time on
this podcast. And now I have to go buy apples from one of the IGAs.
Yeah, go to the one on the right. I've heard that the IGA on the right is the better one. So...
Okay, well as I see it, that's the X-Mouth IGA, not the Ningaloo IGA.
No, you're going to want that one, trust me on that.
Alright, alright, I'll do it.
Alright, you keep us abreast of what's going on over in the faraway land of X-Mouth and
we will be in touch.
Alright, see you guys, thanks a lot.
All right, I have removed him from the call.
Oh, I can report him now.
(laughing)
Who do you want to report?
Andrew Canyon.
What happened?
His connection was terrible.
Oh, spam.
There we go.
- I was gonna say, she invaded the call.
That's what he did.
- Should I report him for spam?
(laughing)
- I think you should.
We already gave him business call and now this.
- Oh man, well, there you go.
That's, we've never had a foreign correspondent on the show,
before. We've had plenty of guests, but that was probably the first live satellite connection.
Zoom bombing.
Yeah. That is, we've been zoom bombed.
All right, where do we want to go next? I would like to talk about, ah, we were shifting
focus.
Oh, to me?
To lenses. That was my shift.
I was like, to what you want to talk?
Oh, no, I saw you had something in here about lenses. So, I went with the shifting focus.
Beautiful.
To the lens. So, that-
I'm with you there.
That landed really good, I think.
That's, no, no, I was still thrown off by the Western Australian Zoom bomber.
That was weird.
Alrighty.
Yeah, that's like, I don't, somebody should report that to someone.
Totally unexpected.
I don't know who, but.
I agree. Yeah. So, I added this to the topic pool for this episode and that is moment lenses. Now,
these aren't particularly new. Do you have any experience with them?
I do. I don't know if they are different versions now, but when they first came out a number of
years ago, I had a set of them where you had the little case and they would kind of like-
Yeah.
Bayonet screw on. I think it was like, this was back probably iPhone six days,
I think, though. Like, this was a long time ago. So, the cameras were not very good. So, I imagine
things are much better now.
I know that you're a photographic enthusiast, and that you probably would have had experience
with that, I was correct. But I wanted to bring them up because I thought maybe some people
haven't had experience with them, or maybe they've improved, as you say, since earlier versions.
Just for full clarity, I have an iPhone 13 mini. Love it. I'm perfectly fine with the whole dual
lens thing. I did like using the zoom lens or telephoto lens on the 11 Pro when I had it,
but I don't miss it a lot. To me, I would actually, or I do actually use the ultra wide a bit more than
than I did use the zoom.
I had to get that kind of open perspective
on the whole scene if you have a nice landscape or whatever.
But I thought, you know what?
I prefer to have a smaller phone
and that's why I was happy to sacrifice
the larger kind of lens system.
And you're absolutely right.
So for anyone who can't see this,
there'll be pictures in the show notes
and even a YouTube link,
I'll include some demos of the different video and photos
you can take on these lenses.
So there is a case and there's a lens mounting system
that you pop in.
And as you explained, you kind of do this screw bayonet thing.
And the two that I ordered with this kind of pack or lens kit was the 58
millimetre telephoto and this anamorphic lens
with blue flare.
There's a gold flare as well, depending on the kind of look that you want.
And I just wanted to talk about it briefly, because if there's anyone out there who
does have a smaller phone, particularly probably iPhones, if you're listening to this
show, Hemispheric Views, and you're thinking, what can I do to extend the
lens system on my iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 mini or earlier, this is a good way to go. And I've really
been enjoying the experience of having this kind of extended customisable phone. Now, for anyone
listening who knows about the telephoto lens, it's a two times lens. Did you have one of these, Jason?
I believe so, yes. I think they only had, I think, two different lenses back then. I think one was
was like a 2X and then one was,
one of them I believe was more of a wide angle
because wide angle was just not a thing back then.
- And the zoom one, I'm not sure what yours was like,
but I wanted to kind of throw this in
because it kind of made me think
about the zoom situation differently.
If you have one of the three times,
I think it is optical zoom lenses on the newer phones,
or you use a DSLR or mirrorless camera
or anything that actually has a zoom lens,
you're gonna be able to go further.
It's something that will actually cover a longer range.
Whereas two times people might think,
Why the hell are you spending this extra money
for this semi-chunky thing
that hangs off the back of your phone
and only gives you two times?
Well, in using it, it's kind of changed my perspective
of what it's useful for.
It's actually really awesome at doing
almost like portrait photography.
And I've been testing it out with Mac
on this new little trike that he has,
like recording video.
And rather than being something
that goes super far into the distance,
I think it's actually really fantastic
giving you that kind of cinematic mode effect, but with a softer, kind of more optical way.
Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, absolutely. It's definitely a different visual
look. Yeah. So if anything, it's less about covering a long range. It's more about what
other look can you give to your videos and photos? So I've really, really been enjoying this. And I
was also motivated to kind of use them for work because I know you've seen this before, Jason,
but I don't expect everyone else listening to know this. I do a bit of video work with the team that
I support at work and we do a lot of different clips of industrial settings, interviews with
employees, basically showing all these different interesting technical aspects of the steel
industry. That's what I'm based in. And just the opportunity to kind of have this enhanced look
because we use our phones a lot in a portable way, you know, to get into different kind of nooks and
and crannies and walkways and stuff.
Just having these different extendable options
is pretty cool.
And I'm quite keen to actually test out the anamorphic
for more detail on the sides.
Because if you haven't used Moment lenses before,
there's actually a specific Moment app,
which you can, other than manual settings and stuff,
like what you might see in apps like Obscura and Halide,
if I've got the pronunciation correct,
you can actually tell the phone which lens is attached.
And in the case of anamorphic,
it actually does the de-squeezing for you.
So you don't have this kind of output,
weird warped video that you have to fix up.
It just puts the black bars on the top of the bottom
and you can capture all of this detail.
So anyway, I don't know if people are actually interested,
but I thought I'd mention it
because it's been around for a while.
I didn't really know about it.
And it just seems like a really well-considered,
thoroughly designed brand of lenses
if you're into phone photography.
- Yeah, they're very high quality.
Everything about, they care about photography
to a very high level, which I think shows.
- Oh yeah.
- I think the other cool thing like you mentioned
was when you're doing work like you do
with video recording, it allows you to be in situations
and change the tone of the room
when you're just using quote, a phone.
Even though these phones produce like
professional quality video now.
When you're faced with a phone
versus a giant red camera
with all this rigging and crap all over it,
it just changes the dynamic of who you're with
in that moment, and I just feel like, huh, moment.
I think that this type of setup
for the stuff that you're doing
probably helps in that respect,
to be able to get into places
where you normally wouldn't be able to,
or just not put people on such a...
When you put a giant camera in front of somebody,
it's very intimidating.
But everyone's used to people having their phones out now
and just doing little, you know,
TikToks or whatever. - It's less threatening.
- So now when you turn that into a professional context,
you could do a lot with just a quote,
"inexpensive phone compared to a camera,"
and some lenses.
I think that's really cool.
- Absolutely.
And you've just reminded me,
and this was a real aha moment in terms of how cool
and capable phones have become for professional recording.
We were doing a story that involved like visiting news media
and they needed to get up, this is the cameraman,
the cameraman needed to get up into a crane
over an industrial kind of warehouse area.
And this isn't a crane like you would imagine
with construction with a big arm.
It's like on a rail that goes over stock,
essentially different coils.
And he went up there to record,
and I had already been up there on that day,
recording our own version of stuff on the phone.
And he came up to me and said,
"Can we actually have that footage
"to show on the news from your phone?
"Because everything's shaky up there with this camera."
The optical image stabilization on the phone
was so vastly superior
that this gigantic shoulder cam for news couldn't do it.
- Yeah, yeah.
- So it's amazing what you can do with some stabilization
and a steady hand and some cool lenses,
or even without them in that case.
But I should mention, just a funny side note to how,
no matter how nerdy or clever you think you are
with this stuff, there's always someone
to bring you back to earth or help you out.
When I received this,
I'm always a bit crap at reading instructions.
I glaze over one thing or read into
or overthink one element too much.
And even though I totally got it,
like I customized with the little screw,
the anamorphic thing to make sure
it was the right arrangement for the right phone,
I understood how to screw these things in.
On the instructions for the actual case
where you put the lens mount in,
the first instruction was remove insert.
This is from the camera cutout section
so that you could put the lens mount in.
I read it, I got it, but I totally misinterpreted it
because the picture of the insert
was exactly the same kind of diagram
or representation as the lens mount.
So I'm trying to jam this thing in and nothing's working.
and I'm getting the total poops for the afternoon.
And then I said, "Natasha, you need to have a look at this."
And she said, "You haven't actually taken the insert out."
(laughing)
So I wasted like hours getting cranky,
thinking I'm gonna tweet moment
and I'm gonna tell them how angry I am
that this doesn't fit.
And she said, "You're an idiot.
You didn't read the instruction properly.
Just pull this thing out."
So kudos to Natasha for actually having a brain
and I'm grateful to have someone
with common sense in this house.
- At least there's one in the house.
That's good to have, yeah.
It's very helpful.
Oh, and to be clear, Moment is not a sponsor. This is just something I wanted to try out.
Not sponsored. No, absolutely not. No, they're not. Question for you, two questions really.
Oh, yeah.
Because there has to be. One, case situation. How's the case? I mean, you got to have the case on,
can't use it without it. Are you like, put the whole case and lens on when you're going to use
it? Have you just kind of succumbed to the fact that I live in a case now? Like, what's that look
like? And oh, also, does that work with, is it MagSafe compatible?
Yes. So there are two options for the case. There's a clear one, which has that white MagSafe
thing, like the visible ring, which is what I'm holding right now. And then there's a solid opaque
one. Both look nice, but I went for the clear one. So yes, it does work with MagSafe. Great question
about using a case because the last kind of two phones that I've had, I've gone caseless because
I love the feeling of just holding the phone. It was a slight, I'm gonna use a case now, not into
it, but I'm dealing with it. It's a first world problem. It feels nice in the hand anyway. And
the fact that there is this super convenient option just to pop these lenses in, it feels
like there's more utility to the case. So I'm less upset about having a slightly chunkier phone.
Got it. And look, if I want to take it off, I can still do that.
Yeah, you just kind of rip it off and you're done.
But the overall build quality of everything is so good that I'm not so
annoyed about it being on there.
It's cool too, because the Moment system is sort of like actual camera systems where
you spend a shit ton of money on the glass, the lenses, but the body, or in this case, the phone,
you can swap out every year if you want, and the lenses will just keep working,
which I think is part of what's great. I assume, I don't know this, I'm fully making an assumption
here, but I would guess that the lenses I had years and years ago probably still work with the
same mounting system that they have today. So just like any other Sony camera or whatever,
I can throw my A7 whatever away, get an A7 whatever's the new one, and all my lenses still
So it's that same kind of system,
which I think is really nice
that you get a really nice quality piece of glass
that you can continue to use going forward.
- You're absolutely right.
And something else that I'd add to that,
particularly with the telephoto lens is this thing,
which as you say, will hopefully last
across phone models in the future.
If people are wondering why on earth
would you wanna carry around a chunkier telephoto lens
that adds weight to this thing
when you could just have a larger phone
that has the zoom lens in it.
This is a very, very niche benefit,
but it's quite meaningful to me.
I used to use the telephoto lens
in some of these industrial environments quite a bit.
And something about the aperture,
I think it was letting less light in.
So you would end up with a lot of grain
in quite dim indoor environments when you did wanna zoom.
Because this telephoto lens is going over the wide lens
with that lens mount,
you're actually just extending the view slightly
or the range over the wider aperture lens,
which means you can have a bit more detail
into the distance without all of that grain.
So if you do have a smaller phone and you want that range
and you are shooting indoors, it's pretty cool.
- Yeah, definitely.
No, I think that's really good.
And then at the end of the day,
if you don't bring the lenses with you,
you still have your cameras.
I mean, you can still take photos.
- Of course.
- It's just, if you know you're gonna wanna have
that little bit of extra, you just bring those with you.
And the difference being you have a phone in your pocket
and you're saying chunky lens,
but you can still throw it in your pocket.
I mean, it's small.
It's not like--
- Yeah, it's not like a DSLR lens.
- You're not like, oh, I need to bring my extra lens
and take this giant fricking backpack along
'cause you need to carry all this crap.
So it's chunky, but at the end of the day,
it's like throwing a set of keys in your pocket.
It's not that big.
It's pretty manageable.
- And if you have a pro or a pro max model
where you already have that,
I think it's three times now, isn't it?
- Three X, yeah.
- Then if you track it two on top of the three,
you have five times for your phone, which is brilliant.
- Yeah, that's very cool.
It just extends functionality.
It's like the phone is great
and like you can just make it even better
with some additional stuff.
So that's awesome.
The only reason I probably would say
I don't have moment lenses or just something like that.
I can't do the case thing. It just drives me bananas. Yeah.
I wish I could get over it. I really do. But I just, I,
I cases last on my phone 15 minutes basically.
Every, I get it. Every other, this is, seems to be the pattern,
every other phone that I get. So, uh,
when I got the 12 mini,
I got the orange silicone case cause I just loved the color from Apple from
Apple. Yeah. Loved it. It's just the color. I love that color.
15 minutes it was in a drawer. Never touched it again. Yeah.
And it seems like every other phone I do that or somehow I think to myself,
Oh, I'm totally gonna use it. I never do. I never use a case. So yeah,
that's my, that's my downfall there. Um, I, and also I do have the,
the Pro one. So like I, I mostly okay.
Would I like to have an extra 2x on that phone? Yeah, I think I would.
But for the most part, it serves much of my, my function.
I am very excited that you have these though. The modularity is very cool.
And if they come out with some new, really wacky specialized lens,
like that's just, again, just throw it on there. It's fine. It's the same mount.
A special edition straight from you, Mr. Jason Burke of App Corner.
Airshow. So, you didn't actually go to an airshow.
This is an airshow that's on your phone.
No, I don't go to airshows anymore.
Airshow. Yeah, I guess it's somewhat of a broader topic.
And maybe I'm sure Andrew has things to say about this as well, but
it feels- we've been talking about podcasting lately, which is, okay,
we're talking about podcasting on a podcast.
Like, okay, sure.
But it feels like there has been every time I go and look at things like the app
store or just there's new podcasts players that seem to be happening at a,
at a greater pace than I would have expected.
And one of them is this air show app,
which is kind of a wacky setup.
I assume everybody has heard about this one by now. If not,
here's yet another contender in your long list of podcast players to try out.
It's wacky, but by wacky what I mean is that it actually runs through Feedbin,
which is an RSS service, which is what I use. I use Feedbin.
I love them. I think they're really great.
And so Airshow is like a sidearm coming out of Feedbin where you put in your
or OPML file from wherever, and it's in Feedbin.
If you go to like Feedbin on the web,
you'll have a thing with all your podcasts in there
that are coming up, but there's a standalone player
for iPad and iPhone that will then effectively
be your player for podcasts,
but it's all going through Feedbin.
It's very simple, it's very stripped down.
It's like it plays podcasts and that's it.
There's not like all this crazy playlists
and audio engines and all that stuff.
It's just like, I wanna listen to podcasts.
I already use Feedbin, give it a go.
So I tried it.
I try every podcast player,
not because I'm necessarily looking
for a different podcast player,
but I'm always interested what they do
with the like metadata part.
So how does the show art render?
How does the title look?
How do the show notes render?
Do they all, do they work at all?
Or is it an Amazon shit show where it's just a giant one forever long paragraph
of, of crap text that you can't even click on.
Thanks for nothing Amazon. So that's why I pretty much try out all of them.
That's my main curiosity is, is show notes as anyone who listens will,
I'm sure understand. I happen to care about that a lot.
So I tried it out for that aspect and it just,
It's a really nice, clean player.
I guess I should actually ask,
have you seen it at all, Martin?
Have you tried it or even seen it?
- I hadn't heard of it before your mention of it
in our topic pool for the show notes,
but I then instantly went to try it
to at least have an idea of what you were talking about.
And I can see what you mean about that newer look.
It looks like they're using the latest stuff
in terms of interface that Apple's released.
So yeah, but I hadn't added or used any podcasts
other than just browsing the app.
- Do you have, I actually don't know.
Do you use Feedbin?
- I did, but when NetNewsWire brought in support
for simple iCloud syncing, I just went straight for that.
And Feedbin was fantastic in terms of my experience with it,
but that setup that I just mentioned seemed simpler
and I didn't need to pay an extra subscription.
- Yeah, same.
I was using iCloud sync as well.
The only, well, I don't wanna say the only,
but one of the reasons I use Feedbin
is because I love to be able to like pre-filter stuff
before it hits my feeds.
That's probably the biggest reason I use it
is so I can say, here's a bunch of stuff
that I simply do not care to ever see.
So go ahead and just mark that all as read
before it even hits my reader
so I don't even have to be bothered with it.
And that-- - Fair enough.
- That pays off for me and I like that.
So it worked out that I could try Airshow
just to give it a go. I'm not like using this every day. I'm,
I'm perfectly happy using the one I'm using,
but I do think it is a solid option if you're trying to really consolidate where
all your stuff is. Right.
Cause I think that's kind of a problem we all face where you start to, Oh,
I've got this for RSS and then I've got this for podcasts and I've got that for
my kind of read it later. And then I use this for my bookmarks.
and it's like, how can we sort of try to get all this
to maybe be in one place just for simplicity's sake?
Not because I necessarily want them all
to talk to each other, but just so that I kinda can land,
do stuff, and then leave and not have to go
to a hundred different places.
So if anyone uses Feedbin already,
and you also listen to podcasts,
which if you're hearing this, I don't wanna alarm you,
but you do listen to podcasts if you're hearing this.
So just be aware of that.
Nothing you need to see a doctor about.
It's perfectly normal.
It happens to everyone, so it's okay.
But yeah, Airshow is, it's new.
I don't necessarily endorse it or anything like that,
but it's a solid option out there
that if you just want to listen to audio,
I think this is a good way to do it, right?
'Cause I mean, at the end of the day,
a podcast and RSS, they're all the same stuff.
It's just happens to be an audio file
instead of a blog post or text.
So it's one of those, you see it and you're like,
oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
Like, of course, an RSS platform would handle podcasts.
Like, yeah, that totally makes sense.
So that is Airshow and I'm intrigued to see where it goes.
I could see if it got a couple more features
that I tend to like out of my current player,
I don't think I would have an issue switching over to this.
I can use it on the web, I can use it on my devices.
It's really all I need.
So there you go, Airshow from Feedbin.
- Do we have anything else to cover or I don't know.
I think that's it.
- I think you've got plenty to edit probably.
- I think so.
- Yeah.
- I think we've got enough.
That's enough time for me probably.
I half of that, I didn't even realize it was going to be here.
So, I mean, that's like a whole thing in itself.
I think, um, I don't know if our listeners appreciate this, but we have a list.
We follow stuff and then weird things happen and then they end up with a show.
Yeah.
How'd it get there?
Don't know, but it's there.
Enjoy.
One prime plus.com.
Long game.
Can I end with one funny story?
Please.
So the other day Valerie and I were walking somewhere,
I forget where we were going.
I think we were going to a bookstore or something.
I don't remember exactly, but we were walking down the street, uh,
side by side, just standard walking down the sidewalk as couples do as you do.
Yeah. You're walking down the street, not single file. That's sort of weird.
Like what is this? 1940 not really. Um, so yeah,
we're walking down the street, chatting about whatever. And there, uh,
there's some people up on, on our left side looking at,
so I don't know what they were doing, shopping, whatever.
And the lady turns kind of towards us as we're walking in.
She says, Oh, I love your shirt. And,
and Valerie immediately goes like, Oh, thanks so much. Or, you know,
just cordially, you know, thank you. And we keep walking. And I'm like,
how do you know she wasn't talking about my shirt?
And the shirt that I happen to be wearing was the one prime plus.com shirt.
She, she had on a legend of Zelda t-shirt, which was obviously what the lady was
referring to being cool and probably saw mine and thought, that sounds dumb.
Why would you even have that on a t-shirt?
What is that? Like, what does it even mean?
Yeah, exactly. So.
And you know, then you have to explain like, well, it's tied to a very specific
April fools episode of the podcast that I make with these two other guys and the
Australian from the East.
So, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
It seemed like a fair guess that she was probably talking about the shirt that was actually
cool and not my bespoke one prime plus dot com shirt.
Well I walk around here, like I go down the road to get coffee with this shirt on it that
says Southern Hemisphere and I have it in my mind that people walk past and if they
do bother to take notice they probably think, well yeah, that's where we are.
What's wrong with you?
Why are you celebrating this?
Who do you think you are?
It's like you might as well just walk around with a shirt that's like, "No shit!"
(upbeat music)

Boom boom, boom boom, doom, doom
