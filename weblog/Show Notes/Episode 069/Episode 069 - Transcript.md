I had to try and explain this podcast to somebody the other day I again failed miserably it's not we haven't sorted out the sales pitch yet or at least I haven't.
Can you both coach me on that? Because this is going to come up for me next week, actually.
So if you could actually give me some pointers around how do I talk about this,
other than just saying, I don't want to talk about this. What's your go-to description or
somebody comes up to you, shoves you against the wall and says, what is this podcast about?
Like, what do you do?
I like the tech adjacent description because it's ultimately a tech show.
we're talking about media and technology, kind of synonymous, because that's the thing that brought
us together. And that's what a lot of the main topics are about. But I like to say that it's
a tech adjacent podcast that bleeds into and brings elements of family life, fun intercultural
differences, and just general silliness from across the hemispheres that then brings our
listeners involved in the Discord because they get to share their own views hemispherically
linked to what we said. So it's just a big chat about a lot of crap. Yeah, in short,
it's mainly a technology podcast that includes other media and silly chat.
Got it. And then do you end with oneprimeplus.com? This is this is good. I mean, this helps everyone,
really, because I'm sure everyone that's hearing this right now is thinking,
Yeah, that would be great information for me to have to arm myself for when I'm out there facing the public.
What do I tell them about this illustrious podcast?
So thank you for that great description.
Does that track with you, Andrew?
Does that seem like a good summary?
It's better than what I had.
Okay.
It's like a tech adjacent podcast.
We talk kind of computer stuff and this guy in Wollongong and a guy in Portland in America.
Yeah.
And then they're like, "Oh."
And I sort of go, "Yeah."
And they're like, "So what kind of stuff do you talk about?"
And then I go, "Uhhhhh."
Hmm. Okay.
Got it. I'm going to go with
Martin's description, I think.
Just, you know, I mean, yours is good and solid.
But I'm going to keep yours as a backup.
Just in case if the first one
doesn't work, I'll be like, "Hey, but guess what?"
"Uhhh." This other thing.
And then I'll go, "Uhhhh."
Do you know what's cool?
it's cool. Despite the fact we have no idea what this show is, some
people pay us. Yeah. And we actually have a new person paying us, I believe. Jason, I
don't know if you have the detail. I've got a small amount of detail. I'm happy
to read that out. Are you, by chance, referring to someone being involved in a
little something we like to call one prime plus dot com? Is that what you're
referring to and potentially someone with the initials Aaron A? That is
correct sir. Can I tell you about the magician that Aaron A is? Can I weave a
little tale for you here? So here's what happened right? Many moons ago in the
one prime plus universe there were multiple tiers you could join. There was
the southern, there was the northern, there was the global, and then there was
another tier that was even higher than that.
But we said, you know what, no, stop.
You've gone too far.
We need more people to have access to this content.
So we just broke down barriers
and we brought everybody down to the lower tier.
All the same stuff, now at a lower price.
That's just the kind of folks that we are.
You know, we're into giving.
But what happens with Aaron A. when he comes along?
goes onto the website, joins,
pledges to be one of the great hemispherians
at a tier that doesn't exist.
- What?
- So I immediately think, we've been hacked, obviously.
What else could have happened?
Someone hacked us to give us money.
It's like a reverse hack.
So I'm going through the ledger as one does.
I'm cross-referencing.
I'm looking at CSVs.
But sure enough, it's legit.
He found a way.
So I challenge everyone else out there
who is not yet hemispherian,
go to oneprimeplus.com,
find those loopholes to give more money
than you even have to,
to get everything that's included in oneprimeplus.com.
So thank you, Aaron A.
- Did we actually get rid of that level?
- Oh yeah, like a year ago.
And-- - I'm really confused now.
You and me both, buddy.
I was like, wait a second, how are you doing this?
What link did we leave live out there
that shouldn't be there?
Nope, he found a way.
When there's a will, there is a way.
Or in this case, when there's an errand, there is a way.
So, oneprimeplus.com.
It's in the long game.
(upbeat music)
Oh yes, I have some follow-up.
You might remember in an episode long, long time ago,
We talked about convenient food.
Yeah. I remember.
I think from memory, I think, you know, pizza was popular burgers.
I think, correct to mention, we, I think we may have missed the most obvious,
just sort of the meat pie.
And then that was introduced as an option because we, we forgot it.
Obviously.
Burritos were on there.
It was like, it was predominantly hand foods that you could pretty much eat
anywhere.
Yeah. So in further sort of crossing of the streams,
I introduced this fine podcast to a business that I've been doing professional work with
because, you know, cross promotion, that's what you do, right?
And you use the intro that you just did not five minutes ago, right?
Okay.
Yeah.
So, I want to just reference Malcolm who...
Malcolm, and I'm going to mention his business because I want people to get behind it, right?
And I've cleared it with him.
I said, "Can I do this?"
He said fine right cross promotion clear with us, but yep go ahead so so Malcolm from Power Shield ups
They make uninterruptible power supplies
So Australian business they get behind him Western Australian business even better
He said to me how did you miss the most obvious convenient food and the best convenient food hmm a
Banana the mighty bananas that because it has a peel
So I think so he appreciated that we had obviously go gone for convenience manufactured food, but he said the banana is everything you need it's got it's got potassium.
It's got other good things in it.
Yep that's what it says right on the label it says has potassium and other good things in it that's that's how they sell it.
It comes in its own biodegradable packaging.
Does you know you're not harming the environment by just throwing that banana peel on the road unless somebody comes along later and slips on it.
That was a bad but generally go cart and you throw it behind you someone hits it and they spin off the road then they have to be picked up by a little guy in a cloud and a fishing hook that's a problem.
Yeah that is a problem so don't do that but apart from everything else I think and I think Malcolm has a point the banana under appreciated perhaps as a convenient food.
- I think the issue here is we probably subconsciously
didn't mention the banana due to a conflict of interest
with previous sponsors being Big Banana.
And that would have looked like, oh sure,
pick a sponsor on your top list of foods.
Yeah, that seems really legit, guys.
So I think that was more of us just trying to really
keep the playing field even, you know,
be fair to everyone and not just go right
for the old sponsor, right?
That's just, you know, we're, we're pretty upstanding here.
So I do appreciate the banana call out though.
Cause there is an episode where, yeah, where we talk about big banana.
Yeah, you're right.
I'd forgotten that.
Now tying perfectly into this food chat, introducing another corner because this
show is, it's been a bit short on corners recently.
Yeah.
So we would like to just move over to food corner.
Jason, can you add some value to this?
Ah, nuts is what I would like to say to that.
Um, four shows ago, we signed off as we do.
I was half standing up for my chair and I said,
damn it, this topic I've forgotten to bring up yet again.
So people that have been around for a while will remember that we often talk
about different foods from our various hemispheres and how they rank amongst us.
So I'm curious to you all specifically nuts,
peanuts, walnuts, and the like.
Is there a go-to or more popular nut in Australia
versus myself who is currently addicted to the pistachio
for which I'm finding to be the best of all the nuts.
So, oh, wow, already getting a twinge over there
from Perth.
There must be some kind of Perth native nut
or something that's gonna be the best nut ever, I'm sure.
- We prefer pistachios.
I was going to say, there's got to be some kind of WA nut that is only from
there. And that's the best. Okay. But other than that one, like what's the,
what is the go-to or predominant nut that you're going to find in Australia?
Is there one?
All right, well, let's go to the nut of the podcast. Andrew, tell us your thoughts.
Well, the first thing that pops into my mind when I hear nuts is nibble knobby's
nuts.
Who doesn't?
Okay. Go, go on.
A famous nut advertising campaign probably stems back from, I don't know, would it be
the 1980s even?
1990s?
I'm sure we can find something to link to that.
But Nibbles Nobby's Nuts.
But Nobby's is quite an overpriced nut brand.
So don't focus too much on that.
Just buy your nuts from anybody.
You don't have to get the Nobby's packs.
Anyway, that is not the point of my answer.
My favorite nut is actually probably the nut
that's worst for you.
And that's the cashew nut.
- Ooh, okay.
- I love a cashew until you eat.
And when I eat cashews,
I think I'll just have a handful of cashews.
Next thing I know, I'm just,
(mimics eating)
- The whole package is gone.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And until you reach that point with cashews,
and I don't know if you guys have this issue,
you're just eating, eating, eating.
And then you have one last bit
And suddenly.
You hate them.
You feel sick.
Yeah.
You go from, oh, this is amazing to, oh, it happens very quickly.
Cashew never, the cashew never disappoints or reaches a limit.
And I have a question for you.
Are these salted or unsalted?
That was going to be a follow up question.
Wait, hold that thought.
Hold that thought.
Okay.
Sorry.
Okay.
Um, so that is, so that's my favorite nut.
And then if I want a healthy nut, I will go the almond.
as my healthy nut option.
- Okay.
Now, Martin, favorite nut, go.
- I agree with Andrew that the cashew
was probably the best go-to nut.
I won't answer the part of the follow-up question
that will get me in trouble.
I think the cashew is the best go-to nut
just because it's generally removed from its pod or shell
before you get to it,
whether you eat them raw or roasted or in whatever shape,
the cashew is the cashew.
That being said, I think the peanut is grossly underrated
and I'm very happy that it's so cheap
because you think about peanut butter, satay,
all these various things you can eat peanuts in,
shelled, not shelled, it's just brilliant.
Although as the king of nuts, I reckon pistachio wins.
- Oh, wow, okay, interesting.
- And I say that because not only is the flavor excellent
but the shelling procedure is so much fun.
And where you get dust off cracking open the shell
of a peanut, which I do love, peanuts are great,
the pistachio has a satisfying click,
you pull it out,
and people think I'm often freaky about this,
and I have had a go at friends and family
when they neglect this part of the pistachio.
When you crack it open and you eat the nut,
there's that tiny little bit that's left attached,
which is often crispy or crunchy
depending on the roasting procedure,
and you either pull it out with your finger
or you just click it with your teeth,
it's brilliant. It's just this extra, it's just this little follow-up delightful nutty bit in
the shell. So you're kind of getting like a bonus with every single nut. And when I see it just
discarded in the bowl, I feel disappointed. I just want to raise on a point of order.
Please do. I think Martin's classification of a peanut as a nut is incorrect. We all know it's a
legume. And I knew you would do that. And Jason actually mentioned the peanut at the beginning. So
Don't get started on me, legume boy.
- Fine, all right.
- Okay, well now that we're--
- You can just enjoy your non-nut nut.
- We will now exit well actually corner
and I will go back to,
okay, so a couple of things on the pistachio.
One, it solves your cashew problem
because it has the inbuilt action of needing to do a task.
So it also gives you a little bit of something to do
if you're kind of watching something or just waiting.
So you got that little bit of extra--
- It's better to fiddle with your nuts while eating.
- I agree, yeah.
So it slows you down, so you got that going for you.
Also, it comes with an inbuilt challenge,
because in every collection of pistachios,
there will be anywhere from one to six
levels of closedness of the pistachio.
- Yes.
- And it will be all the way from,
well, actually, I take that one to seven,
'cause it goes all the way from,
it's just in there, the nut is just out
floating around in the bowl and you're like, that's a freebie. Cool.
Down to the no problem. No, I'm just opening it up.
Then you get a little further down the list and it's like, Oh,
this one's like kind of only three quarters available.
So now you're trying to get some ingenuity in there all the way down to fully
sealed shell. And now you're stuck with,
do I discard? Surely not.
Or do I accept this challenge and find a way
to get this thing open?
That's one of my favorite things is
how do we get that nut open?
And that completely depends on situation and location.
If you are on a bus, that gives you a whole different
set of tools to use.
If you're in your garage and you got a vice handy,
put it in the vice in the garage,
just enough to get it to pop.
So I just, I think the pistachio is fun,
delicious, and just all around good.
So quick--
- Power tools with a clamp.
- Exactly, so quickly back to the roasted level
and salt level.
So roasted level, less common.
Sometimes you can find things where there's like
a light roast, regular roast, or heavy roast or whatever.
But salt, usually there'll be like a low salt,
which I think is mostly just for health.
regular salt, I don't think there's heavy salt.
Usually that's just salted.
So in terms of roasted and salted,
are any of you monsters who eat non-roasted unsalted
and just go at it?
Or are you all fairly upstanding citizens
and just have some level of roast and salt?
- I have a crisis of confidence whenever I go to the store
and I look at all the options
'cause I can never remember which one I actually like.
So my anxiety levels when I'm buying my nuts
increases dramatically.
And even now, she asked me this question, I'm not sure.
I think I like, and I'm referring to cashews in this case,
I think I like a roasted non-salted.
- Wow.
- I believe that's the option that I like the most.
I don't, I'm pretty certain I don't like non-roasted
'cause they get soft.
If they're not being roasted,
they're too squishy and it's not right.
So I think you need roasted cashews,
But the salt level, I don't know.
Sometimes if you get them too salty,
they just like, it just leaves a yucky sort of
overpowering flavor in your mouth.
I think it's roasted and unsalted,
but yeah, my anxiety level right now is growing.
- Yeah, as it should be.
That was what that question was meant to do.
So job done there.
Martin, you are a roasted, salted, you love salt.
You're a salt fanatic, right?
- I love.
I really, really love salted roasted nuts.
You're right, I think the flavor's excellent.
However, I would generally choose unsalted over salted
because I don't think it's necessary.
The flavor of anything from a macadamia
through to pistachio, cashew, whatever,
the flavor's so good if it's roasted well
that you don't need it.
And then you can eat more of them
without feeling parched or guilty or sick.
So salt probably is better as a flavor
a snack in most cases, but it doesn't need to be there.
I'm just going to call you out there.
You mentioned macadamia.
That is the worst nut, the most disgusting nut.
No, it's not. It's delicious.
And it's great when integrated into desserts such as ice cream.
That texture is just blech.
No, that's what makes it delightful.
Bloody hell. We have a macadamia tree outside.
Not that we can harvest any of it because the cockatoos just rip it all out, right, and drop like the pods or the shells onto the ground.
And then you have these minor explosions under your tyres as you park it down stairs.
I don't like that because it's like cracker cracker cracker crack under your tires. Thanks cookies
damn cockies
All right, that is
nut corner
Aaron is just loving that he found that top tier right now. He's like damn that was I'm paying how much for what now?
Right, so we've covered bananas and nuts
Jeez Martin, what's up next?
Well from what I can see we have a gaming corner more and more corners, and I think I suggested putting this in here
We've got a foot and a robot those two emoji in our notes
Sorry, Andrew. You can participate if you wish but the focus was just a brief update on play date because
After ordering mine 12 years ago. It has arrived and I've been enjoying it and it's not a dig at panic
You know, we all know the supply chain stuff. I've really been enjoying it Jason. Are you still enjoying your play?
Yeah, I mean, like you said, it took a while for them to get there. So we're obviously on
the Playdate 5 now here. But the Playdate 1, I do recall back that far, and I do remember it fondly.
No, yes, I still have the Playdate. It's actually sitting right next to me because I'm charging it
to bring with me next week. And it is great. It's just like a cool, different little device.
And I'm jealous that the way that for anybody who doesn't know or doesn't remember when you get it
on day one, you are, I guess subscribed is the right word, but you have a season of games,
but you don't get them all at once. So the day Martin got it, he got all the games,
but they slowly download for him every week. I believe, is it every week?
It's like two a week.
You get two at the start and then they follow like that.
So I just I hope that model continues because it really helps with the oh, no
I just got like 15 games and I don't know which one to play and it's like dad
It's just that you get a whole week to just dive into one and really find out is it for me?
Is it not you don't just do the quick glance and then toss it aside
You can say like well if I don't play this one, I don't have anything else
So I might as well see if this is really for me or not
And I think that was a really cool way to go.
So how have you found it in terms of,
I was going to say like in terms of complaints people have had,
but there really haven't been any that I recall.
I don't really have any myself either.
I think you knew what you were getting and you got that.
So I don't think there was really any surprises,
but I would be curious to know if,
if there was anything you thought was going to be there that was not or vice,
you know,
the other way, wasn't there that you thought was going to be there.
I think what I like about it the most, gaming aside for a second, what impressed me about the
system other than the build quality of the device was the kind of system that Panic has set up
for interacting with it or managing it from the web. I've been really impressed by that. It has
that kind of, you know, it just works Apple vibe about it in the sense that you've got your account,
you sign up in order to, you know, register and order the device and then it arrives.
And then you've got the side loading thing where you can upload apps or games really that you can
purchase elsewhere like itch.io I think is the main one. Play— Panic may have its own Playdate
store in the future, kind of like the App Store, but it'd probably be run differently. I just love
the fact that you just upload these files and then it appears there and it's easy to navigate.
It kind of has this iPod style through the menu hierarchical system.
It just feels focused, simple.
I love the size of it.
So I think some of my favorite things are just how you interact with it.
I think the crank is not a gimmick.
I think it's delightful.
Games like Crankin's Time Travel Adventure, probably the one that's been marketed the
most.
Can you say that again?
The name is the best.
What's the name of that?
Crankin's Time Travel Adventure.
So good.
I thought I said it incorrectly.
I thought I said it incorrectly for a second.
- It's just a joy, isn't it?
- I think it's really cool
because you kind of look at this device
and I'm sure there are skeptics out there who go,
okay, well, you got the Game Boy style stuff
on the beginning with the D pad and the A and B,
but this crank thing, it's just gimmicky.
They're just trying to differentiate.
But when you play something
like "Crankin's Time Travel Adventure"
and the only control, really,
the main control is that crank,
and you realize, wow, I'm actually controlling space
and time as he moves left and right
to get to his date on time.
Spoiler, he's pretty much always late.
It's just amazing that the turning of one piece
of the interface can have so much finesse attached
to it going up and down, left and right, slow.
It's just brilliant.
So I just think it's a really well-considered system.
And given the fact that it's deliberately kind of retro
and simple, the fact that it has this complexity baked
into it is very impressive.
Crank is like so many input things before
where it completely matters whether you are designing
for it or you are cramming it in later because you forgot.
And it's like the, it reminds me of the Wii,
when the Wii came, the Nintendo Wii came out
and they had the motion control in the controller.
And there were the games that just sort of added it in
last minute, 'cause yeah, I guess we need to do that,
versus the games that were built around that mechanic.
You can just tell that they make more sense.
So I think to your point,
that's exactly what's going on with the crank,
is if people are embracing it and building around it,
it's so much more impactful as a game than just saying,
"Oh yeah, I guess we'll just use the crank
"to look at a menu 'cause the crank is there."
Or we're gonna ignore it entirely
and it's just gonna be D-pad and A and B.
It's like, well then why are we even here?
So I, yeah, the crank I do also agree is not,
it's not a gimmick, it's a legit control input
that is pretty delightful to use
when it's implemented correctly.
- Yeah, and what I'd add is,
I know there are people who listen to this podcast
who are probably less into hearing us talk about gaming.
For them, if they're switching off going,
what's this crank, why do I care?
Aside from gaming, the feel of this is just
when you pick something up that was thoughtfully designed
to be cool or fun or ergonomic.
So it's like that kitchen utensil that you pick up
that feels perfect in your hand,
or the car that you drive that just gels
with the way that you think or wanna handle the wheel.
Just think of any tool in your life
that feels like it was designed around that
and the enjoyment you get every day.
It's just that ergonomic idea in a gaming console
that fits in your pocket.
- Agreed, and the side loading thing
that you mentioned is phenomenal.
It just works so good.
put it on a website, open up your device,
it downloads, done.
It's so easy.
- And I've had no issues with it.
I bought a couple of other games.
I actually bought like a discount bundle
and I've been resisting just loading them all on
for fear of what you said before,
just like a huge menu that you can't choose from.
And to be honest, even with that play date staggering
of the season, I've still had that issue
of I don't play it quite as much as what I'd like.
So then they do build up anyway.
So kudos to Panic for trying to pace it,
but I still kind of struggle to get through all of it.
(upbeat music)
- It's gonna be techie, it's gonna be nerdy.
So if you didn't like gaming.
- No adjacency here, this is full frontal tech.
- Tech, security updates.
You know how much we like talking about security updates.
- Oh, it's our favorite.
- And the Mac over recent years
has gone through a number of iterations
of how it helps protect its own operating system
from malware and bad actors on the internet.
It has gatekeeper system.
It's had something called X-Protect, I think.
Now I'm no expert in this field.
I just read a few articles now and then.
The real person to read,
if you wanna know everything about this,
is Howard Oakley's blog over at eclecticlight.co.
Quite an interesting, this guy is,
You think about me enjoying tech and then basketball.
This guy is into tech at like deep, deep knowledge level,
like down to the low level system knowledge.
And then he also blogs about art, like Renaissance paintings.
So if you follow his RSS feed, you have a TikTok approach.
You get a deep dive into Mac architecture,
And then you'll get a deep dive into artistry.
- Wow, that's cool. - And paintings,
and styles of paintings.
He's quite amazing, like he's eclectic.
So he's doing what he says on the tin.
But what I'm talking about is the Mac security problems.
So all the Mac is meant to,
the Mac is meant to update itself
and keep itself protected.
Apple pushes updates and that kind of thing,
until it doesn't work.
(laughing)
And it particularly doesn't seem to work
if you were to run a content caching server
in front of your Mac, which I do.
So that's often, if you have a little Mac mini somewhere
or a server acting as a way to produce
your download bandwidth,
'cause it'll cache software updates,
it'll cache app updates,
it can even cache iCloud content if you want it to.
- And that's content caching for the rest of us.
- I never said that right.
You're right, I think I meant to say caching as well.
Isn't it caching?
I'm just doing what you do to me every time I say anything.
So I admire you for that.
Me too.
It's nothing to the queue.
Yeah.
So I was so Canadian there for a second though.
He was just like, oh, I'm sorry.
Was I saying that wrong?
That was not what I was expecting at all.
So I, piss off mate.
It's part of being in the Commonwealth.
We all do it.
Um, so yeah, the, the content cache, um, doesn't seem to pass through the security
updates effectively.
So if you have Macs behind a content cache,
Oh God, I've ruined him now. He's just going to really overanalyze himself now.
You have, yeah,
you've got a real issue where your Mac may be unprotected from known threats and
vectors on the internet.
So the first step to do is maybe think about turning off that content cache and
just letting your Mac connect directly to the Apple servers and update.
'cause that seems to work.
And I'm sure that's the Martin approved approach.
Keep it simple.
I'm sure he does that.
- I don't think it was installed there to begin with,
but yeah.
- But me, I turned it off for a while and I let it update,
but then I've turned it back on again.
'Cause I just like having app updates come down
to my devices nice and quickly.
But he has a solution.
And that is his app that he's built called Silent Night.
You can download it from the website and it goes through
and it checks all the various security versions
on your Mac versus the ones that Apple say you should have.
And I've just run it on mine,
this iMac sitting behind a content cache.
It's got green ticks everywhere, except for XPR 75,
it should be version 78.
- Ooh, XPR 75.
- Yeah, and XPR has also had no scans in the last 24 hours,
but I can tell you that XProtect is up to date with 2163.
That used to be a problem.
So maybe Apple is starting to fix things
'cause that didn't used to update.
Who knows what's going on, but I can,
there's a button in Silent Night
and it says, "Install all updates."
And if you click that,
hopefully everything will be brought up to date.
- And to be clear, Silent Night with a K, right?
- Correct, correct.
It's a night with a sword and shield.
- People start getting very Jesus related,
you know, songs popping up.
- Yes, you have a good point.
And there is a command line version as well.
So if you're a bit of a Unix nerd,
you can run it from the command line. It is really cool. Um,
I just like, and if you want to learn all about this max security stuff,
go to his website cause he is a writes about it eloquently.
And if you read it, I think you'll have a fair crack at understanding it,
even if it's not your thing. So there you go.
Make sure your Mac has its software security software updates.
That is my enterprise security corner of the week.
I have a secondary fix for this as well.
And that is a gigabit internet.
Don't cash anything, just download it
as fast as they can give it to you.
- Don't you hate this guy sometimes?
- Look, I mean, the US is known for its modesty.
- Gigabit, get out of town.
- It's fine, somebody's gonna remind me
that they have like 2.5 gigabit or something
and I'm gonna be like, yeah, I know.
But back in the day, do you remember California games?
No.
And you had the, you had, I think it was California game.
You had, yeah, I had surfing, you had hacky sack, you had BMX.
That sounds like California games.
Oh, it was awesome.
It was better than summer games or winter game.
Cause it wasn't, you know, summer games made by Epics, E P Y X.
It was so many games that you just like joystick mashing, you know, run the
hundred meters just back and forth on your joystick.
But some of the hacky sack was awesome.
And BMX was-
What year was this Andrew?
It had to be like the eighties, right?
Oh, that's one for the show notes.
I can't remember, but I was a young lad.
So it was probably before your time Martin.
California games would have been, yeah.
What? Surfing, BMX, hacky sack.
Yeah.
Volleyball probably.
Frisbee.
Frisbee.
Oh, Frisbee for sure.
Yeah.
That makes sense.
It was such a good game.
[Music]
Media Corner.
With this many corners, it's going to be a circle.
Soon.
But if you zoom in enough...
That's a fractals!
Back to fractals!
Or whatever it was, the other thing that you called it in that show.
Fibonacci sequence, I think it's what we were planted on last time.
I just hear that whole thing and think, "Frack you." That's all I'm thinking, Andrew.
I shout out to my mate, Firsty, who knew what I was talking about.
Love that. On the Discord, Firsty, I've renamed him.
I've renamed him. Firstenburg's, it's too long.
Oh, OK.
This, got it.
We've Australianised it.
I thought you were- I saw it in the Discord the other day.
You were fourth walling somehow with like someone that neither of us knew about.
And you just happened to talk to at the shop when you were buying some.
No, no, no.
Firstie.
I just love the nickname that you've given to Furstenberg is the way that three year old Australian kids mispronounce the word "thirsty".
Thirsty.
I'm thirsty, mum.
I love, I love, I love thirsty because I feel like he's Norwegian me.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Is that a compliment?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
I'm issuing it as one.
It's an observation.
But he chooses to accept it as a compliment.
I'm going to overlay the spreadsheet of patron subscribers to this show launching and we'll
see if those numbers suddenly drop by one.
We'll see.
This is kind of a mega media corner, really.
I mean, this is big.
Yeah.
So in the notes it says share your top five movies with everyone, whatever genre.
That's that's a tall order.
First of all, to pick the top five of anything.
I picked 18.
I just want to start off with that.
Surprised you stopped there.
I won't go through the whole.
I will put the list in the notes, which by the way, if you're not reading these notes,
You should probably get on that.
These notes are like world class.
I would just say across all media of the universe, top five are these notes.
They have to be, right?
I've never seen anything better than these shoutouts.
Never.
So I'll put all 18 in the notes, but I will just chop the list.
I'll draw a line underneath five.
But how do you all feel we should we do like everybody do one and we all do our five, four,
three, two, one, everybody do their list of five.
What do we want to do?
Because I'm most curious if there's gonna be overlap here.
If there's not, that's almost more exciting, but we'll see.
Okay.
Can I preface?
Can I add a preamble?
I'm not really.
That's not preface, is it, Andrew?
Are you mispronouncing that one too?
It's a preamble.
Sorry, preface away.
Yeah. Preamble. So, my bit before I give my list, I'm not really a huge movie guy.
And I'm also really bad at remembering things that I like and having sort of a pantheon.
I'm not good. They kind of wash over me.
Shut up, Martin.
Knowledge graph that you-
Go on.
Oh, so, so I really struggled with this.
I'm not just not good at like making best ofs.
I just kind of, so I struggled massively.
And I think my list that I have is probably not my actual list.
And you guys will say movies and I'll be like, Oh yeah, of course.
Can I plus one that?
Absolutely.
I'm the exact same way.
A perfect example.
I had to pick a song like for myself, for this thing I'm doing next week.
And I spent like, everybody else would be like, "Oh yeah, this song." And they'd be like, "Done."
I'm sitting here like two hours listening to every single track I can think of throughout history,
trying to like, "Oh no, make that one. Oh wait, no, this one." So I'm going to be the same. And
there's probably going to be movies that I forgot. There are going to be ones that you might mention
where I go, "Oh, actually, yeah, I want that one instead." So I think that's a fair preamble
For myself as well. I can tell you the song that you are if you want me to just help you out real quick.
Sure, please. It's a song by Radiohead. Okay, I'm not scared yet.
Okay, it's from the album Okay Computer. Loving it already. This is high praise.
Okay. You're not calling him a subterranean homesick alien, are you?
No, it's the one- I mean, if the shoe fits. Now, I think the track I'm thinking of is
fitter, happier. It's basically just more productive. It's two minutes of robot voice.
Oh, OK. Well, it's a Mac voice.
Isn't it Fred? Is it Fred or is it someone else?
I'm not sure that... I might have mixed up the names.
But yeah, it's just it's it's Jason.
It's a robot talking for two minutes.
That was easy. I should...
Where were you a week ago?
I love that album by the way.
Well, thank you for that. I will, I will admit.
Well, we know that there's no preamble for Martin because he is a cinephile and
he remembers every bit of dialogue from every movie ever made since the
beginning of time, including the silent films. So figure that out.
I think we'll go with just, let's just go in a circle, right?
Let's go Martin, Andrew, myself,
and we'll see where we land and we can kind of just.
All right. I'm going to get the most obvious one out of the way for myself.
and that is The Matrix. I just think as far as movies go, not only is it a visual treat,
and it was revolutionary for its time, you revisit this film, hope Matrix fans enjoy that reference,
revisiting the film, you will notice just how much it holds up, just how good it is.
The music's brilliant. I regard this as a perfect movie. And you don't have to be a sci-fi fan to
enjoy it because there's some level of mystery or discovery for everyone.
I knew he'd say that. All right. My one is my first one is Office Space. You want to talk about a perfect movie? You're talking Office Space.
It sums up my life.
Number one spot, baby!
It's my life. It's my experience. It's how I respond to many situations. So many of my life situations, I refer back to Office Space for my wisdom.
When you say it's your life, you're the guy who keeps getting moved around, right?
With the stapler. Yes.
I'm burned out a bit.
This is going to be quick because that is literally the top one on my list.
So office space.
That was easy. Martin, number two.
The next one in my list is
it's an American movie, but it's directed by an Australian,
and I love it for that.
And I think it's the perfect blend of comedy and fairly emotional drama.
And that's the Truman Show.
Oh, interesting.
And I think it's actually the best example of Jim Carrey's acting,
Because I know he kind of, over time, has been dismissed for being this absurd, you know, physical freak.
I think there's a lot of talent behind the comedy that he's stereotypically done.
But this is an example of reining it in for drama and dispensing it in silly moments where appropriate.
I think it's a great movie.
Okay.
My number two, The Breakfast Club.
So, I mean, it just captures teen angst perfectly.
It has a bit of funny, bit of drama.
different characters all capturing that essence of high school and also as an
Australian looking at that high school with that that library that looked epic
which I later found out was filmed in some gym or some some other setting that
wasn't actually a library but yeah it summed up so much of what I wanted my
high school experience to be. Perfect. My number two is rear window Alfred
Hitchcock joint. A lot of different Alfred Hitchcock stuff that I like,
but this one again, is it his best movie ever? I don't know.
You figure it out. But for me, this one just,
I love the pacing of it.
I love the overall story arc that happens and just the,
I think part of it is because he's a photographer too.
And that sort of resonates with me. So yeah,
- My rear window, Alfred Hitchcock, number two.
- You'll love it.
All right, my next one, comedy classic
and a great parody of a fantastic franchise.
And that is Austin Powers' International Man of Mystery.
- Oh, good.
- Love it.
And I love the blend of different comedy.
The fact that you've got a Canadian guy
in an American film, parodying English stuff.
And then as you go through the other films,
there's, you know, absurd Scottish bits.
It's just perfect comedy and one guy
playing multiple characters, which is not easy to do.
- This is a perfect example of how we started this,
where I didn't even remember that that was a movie
before we started talking about movies.
Not for any, not like in a bad way,
but it's just, there's so much stuff.
And now that you mentioned it, I'm like,
oh yeah, that was great.
Okay.
- What movie did you just say?
I've forgotten.
Austin Powers.
My next movie is The Naked Gun it's got it's just so absurd I love it Leslie Nielsen plays that to a T it's excellent it's yeah great movie just.
This is the first one not 33 and a third.
Yeah first one I've got to give it to the first one.
Yeah, yeah, okay
Again, another movie that had you quizzed me that probably never would have come up
third is army of darkness
Are you both have not seen that? Okay? It is it is a
Comedy horror movie
Sam Raimi, I think that's how you say his name. Raimi Raimi Raimi something like that
Ash the guy with the chainsaw hand, maybe you know
It's hilarious and I think everyone should at least see it once
So now you have homework is the other hand a normal hand or is it?
I can't tell you why the hand is the way it is because spoilers, but it's not like a power sander or no
She's great. No, no
Not in the first one. Ah
No, it's not it's not it's not a power sander ever Martin number
four four four
Four I've actually been kind of rewriting this as I'm going which is dreadful cheat like it keeps on like rotating no
No, I committed and then I pulled it out, but I put it back in because they're all good
Damn it. Okay. Okay number four. I'm gonna go for a fish called Wanda. Hmm. Okay
Yes
long time ago now, but yeah.
- I think this movie is the best example
of American and English comedy meeting
and actually pulling it off.
'Cause you regularly have these discussions
and stuff like movies and television where,
ooh, the Office UK is better, or the Office US is better,
or which remake or original?
It's a bit boring.
They fit different audiences.
Some are remade, who cares?
But this is actually really an English movie
where you've got Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis
coming as the Americans,
and it's just this perfect series of errors
and misunderstandings and people trying to one up each other.
And I love the fact that this is kind of like another movie
that I wanted to put in the list,
but I'll leave out, kind of like "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels",
if you've ever seen that,
or at least the remake with Michael Caine and Steve Martin,
where the most powerful or surprising
or directing figure in the story
is a woman among a bunch of men who think they know what they're doing or that they
have control. So it's a great mix of different cultural stereotypes and you're somewhat surprised
in the end.
Excellent. Andrew, number four.
My number four is 12 Angry Men. Now this, there's actually two versions of this. There's
a very ancient black and white version and there's a, well, similarly ancient now because
It's a long time ago 90s version with Tony Danza. Basically, it's a story of
jurors a group of jurors trying to come to a decision in a
In a case. I think it was originally a stage play. I really like it
I'll probably nominate the original original but both are good 12 angry men. Are any of them rural jurors?
I really like it. I haven't watched it in a long time. I'm due to watch it again.
I'm definitely going to go watch this. I feel like I may have seen it, but I'm looking at it now,
and it's from 1950. So, I'm definitely going to watch it. So, number four on the list that I've
not been editing throughout this show, Beetlejuice. Oh, neither have you seen it?
Never seen it. I know what it is, but I've never seen it.
It's too Tim Burton-y.
Well, that, that tracks. Yep.
Yeah. I don't like it. Can't get behind it.
Okay.
Second movie to go watch now is Beetlejuice. So make sure you do that.
What do you love about it?
This is one of those movies that I've seen a billion times and I started
watching it at a way too young of an age before anyone should really be watching
something like that. And everything about it's funny at certain parts of your
It's sort of like scary when you're younger and
Well now
Or yesterday when I was under a blanket crying
it's just got everything you could want and and
Michael Keaton is just like
Genius, it's just so good. He's so good in that and
It's a little bit of that nostalgia thing for sure. But every time I watch it, I absolutely love it
So it's not one of those where you miss remember that you loved it and then you watch it again and you go
Oh, that's not quite as good like crocodile dundee three, right?
Everybody thinks they love it and then they go back and watch it and it's like oh, that's not what I remember being good
Yeah, so beetle juice. Oh, i've said it twice. I will not say it again
Noted. So this is number five number five. Yeah, so are you done?
Redoing your list?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you for allowing time for that. This is in the same kind of
general nostalgic Feld family favourite category as A Fish Called Wanda. And it's the movie
What's Up Doc? Have either of you seen that?
No.
No, I don't think so.
This is a movie, which funnily enough, even though it's from the 60s, is a remake of a
movie called Bringing Up Baby. But I think if you talk to just about anyone who has seen the movie,
you look up any reviews, people would actually say this is funnier or better.
Like it's a remake that has more cultural like hold than the original did.
That's my understanding.
But this is a movie that you don't see movies like this anymore.
I don't think I've ever seen a comedy that's as quick and absurd as this.
The premise is basically it has Barbara Streisand and Ryan O'Neill in it
from the 60s, and it's all about all these different people
having the exact same design or brand of suitcase, and they all have different urgent things that
they have to do with things that are in their suitcases. But guess what happens? They get mixed up.
Oh, my gosh. Okay.
And it's so well done. And there are so many different errors that happen. And there's musical
elements. There's this really, really irritating guy. And you're not sure if he's Italian or
Croatian because he kind of mixes it all up. It has Randy Quaid in it as well, if you're a fan of
any of the old National Lampoon's vacation films. And it all takes place around this musical
convention at this hotel in San Francisco. It all goes wrong. This is a movie you have to see.
So this is not a Bugs Bunny documentary?
No, but the name is a reference to the Looney Tunes franchise.
My last one.
Bring it home strong.
The Matrix. No, I'm just kidding.
No, that's it. Now, Matrix gets double mention.
No, it's not The Matrix.
No, it's all right. Matrix is all right, but it's not on my list.
Stupid wit.
Moving on, number five.
My number five. I'm representing Australian cinema culture here. The Castle. If you want
to watch a classic Australian movie, you need to watch The Castle. Martin,
I think you would agree with me it's just the vibe of the thing.
I don't think he's going to agree with anything you say now.
Now look at it look look Andrew I will say it's the vibe of the thing it's the Constitution it's Marlboro it's just the vibe.
He wants that for Joust the Sticks tell him he's dreaming.
But before we finish the show today we got to I got to I got to move the Commodore and then I move the Tirana and then I got to move the Falcon so I can get to the Gemini.
Yeah, as long as you maintain the serenity because...
You need serenity.
Serenity.
Okay, the castle. That wraps it up.
There will be translations for all of that in the notes.
Number five.
What are these? Love? Rissoles.
That's why you've done them, they're beautiful.
I still say that to Hannah all the time.
I do, yeah.
It's a common one, I mean, you know, table.
Sorry, Jason.
Don't worry, everyone. I don't know what the hell's going on either.
(laughing)
- But I have to say about that movie,
I love that movie and it's an Australian classic,
but if you were to watch it, Jason, right?
With all of your knowledge of cinema that you like,
or at least your appreciation of the picture quality
of American movies, this thing was made in 1997
and it looks like it was made with,
I don't know what old technology
that they dragged out of the garage.
Like it just shows the budget
that Australians had to play with at the time,
or at least these filmmakers.
It's hilarious.
- Okay, you're both over your one sentence limit.
Would you like to add any more final closing arguments?
- It pains me not to include a movie like Blade Runner.
- Wait, wait, not final, final, just final on that movie.
I haven't done my fifth one yet.
- Okay, Charles Bud Tingwell.
- Okay.
- I'm done now.
- Okay, that's all you get.
Anything about the castle, Martin?
No?
- It sums up Australian culture,
At least I suppose you could say whiteness very well.
- My number five is not the castle, surprisingly.
I know you thought I was gonna pick it.
It is back to the future.
- Great. - Yeah.
- I'm pretty with that. - It's just great.
- I almost had that.
I almost had that.
- It's fun.
Every bit of it is fun.
It's time travel.
Who doesn't love that?
Cast, amazing.
It's just great.
So there you go.
Now for my rapid fire, six through 18.
No, not really.
- No, I gotta edit this thing.
- It won't be, nope, it's not in there, it's done.
That is media corner times 15.
