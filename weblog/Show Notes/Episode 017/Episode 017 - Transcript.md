Guys, just to kick things off, I'm wondering if we can jump straight ahead to my tech surprise.
No, we're not really interested in that.
Of course we are!
What the heck is it?
It's been like eight months.
I'm on my standing desk, but this is getting ridiculous the way I'm kind of perched right
now.
So I'm just going to make things a little more comfortable and just move the microphone.
I was really wondering why the hell you were positioned so incredibly awkward.
Is he going to stand that way for an hour?
I thought, is he hiding his glasses?
He's cut half his face off.
Is the tech surprise he has new glasses?
He's built this up for two weeks.
It's not the new glasses.
I'm really hoping though that I have some dulcet sounds right now.
You sound amazing.
Because I have somehow, somehow through fortune, acquired, at least for a period of time, a
Shure SM7B microphone.
And so yes, this is the first real use of it.
I saved it for Hemispheric Views.
So I'm hoping that this bad boy is doing the trick.
I was going to try to, I was going to guess microphone, but then I thought, no, Andrew
has like six microphones already.
Uh, surely it's not another microphone.
Uh, then I thought maybe it was something to do with a camera and you were going to
like go from this weird angle that you were at and somehow zoom out to some kind of ultra
wide action or something.
But it was very awkward that you were standing the way you were.
So this I'm much happier that you look comfortable now and you probably won't have back issues
tomorrow.
So tell us about this microphone.
So as you know that just for a bit of history I started off with a Rode Podcaster back in
Back in my naive podcasting days when I thought,
sure, a USB microphone would be enough.
Like USB dynamic microphone, sure, that's all I need.
The next thing you know,
you realize you want an audio interface
and that only need, that has to have XLR.
So I needed an XLR microphone really quickly,
which led me down the path of the Audio Technica ATR2100X,
which has both XLR and USB-C.
Pretty cool.
That lasted about a week because I realized that the feedback I was getting from it from the microphone
just or the into the earphones was just terrible. I don't know I probably had something set wrong
so it's probably user error but I also just thought it was a bit ugly wasn't really professional
looking and it didn't fit on the boom arm very neatly that I had the the Rode PSA1.
So I thought well I'm going to go back to Rode and I got the Rode Procaster the XLR version of
of the podcaster. And I've been happy with that. That's been awesome. Jason went ahead
and spent the big money and got the Shure SM7B and I looked at it in the last and thought
ah, if only, but in Australia they're really expensive. So anyway, I was at my nephew's
house the other day and he's a muso. He's a bass player, plays in bands, used to do
international touring when that was still a thing. So, he's quite talented musician.
Ah, so you swiped it. Nice.
Yes. So, I was looking through his coverts, you know, because he was showing me his gear
and I saw that he had a short - a SF7B set up for his own studio. I was like,
"Oh, look at that. I could rattle off what it was." And he was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
He's like, "Actually, I've got two of them because dad, which is my brother,
his dad, bought two of them so that we could do, we were thinking about doing some sort of podcast
or at least online chat together and it just never really panned out and my dad, so my brother,
lives overseas now and he didn't take the microphone with him. So there was this short
SM7B sitting there in the box in my nephew's cupboard. I said, "Alex, I'm sorry mate but
Would you mind if I borrowed that?
Was he hesitant?
Yeah, he was like, fine.
And my nephew's wife, she was like, yes, take it because it gives us more cupboard space back.
How big was the box?
It's not that big, but you know, like any win is a win, I guess.
So I've ended up, took it home.
This SM7B doesn't look like it's ever been used to the fact that I've actually had to put the
alternate windshield on it because the original one, I think it had been, maybe
it'd been opened once used, put back in, but the, the, whatever it's made of had
started to rot. You know, it's sort of, that sort of, um, foam can rot if it's
just left, it'll start flaking off. So I've put the bigger windshield on, but
apart from that, I think it's brand new.
It's like when you find one of those, one of those old cars in a barn in the middle
nowhere and it was bought, never used, and you just come upon it, it's like treasure.
Yeah. Yeah. The closest thing, exactly that, or given my world at the moment, it's like
digging up a thousand bells in Animal Crossing. It's very much the same thing, yeah.
So, like when you buy a new keyboard, right, for example, you're feeling something under your
fingers, there's a difference. When you're putting on new headphones as Jason has, you've got this
different cushiness or audio quality in your ears. You've said this is the first time that
you've used it for proper podcasting, but I'm assuming you've tested it. Do you feel
any different or feel like you sound different listening back to yourself?
I did a super quick test with it earlier, and I did think it sounded nice when I was
hearing it back. As I talked to you guys though, and this is the first time I've used it through
Skype, I am not hearing myself very well at all through the headphones. I don't know if
Skype thing, again, something that I've got misconfigured. So, I'm not hearing myself
come back through my headphones very well at the moment. I'm a little dissatisfied about that.
But hopefully, it sounds right to you. Well, it seems smooth to us,
I think. Do I sound like a radio DJ? You look like one. Oh, we're talking beyond radio DJ,
like national audio figure. I don't know. What's the term for that? Very important person is what
what I would go with.
Hey, in beverage corner this week, I'm breaking out.
I have, I have my trusty bottle of water,
just filtered, but otherwise straight from the tap.
But most importantly, I've got something called Chow Bar. Wow.
Is that pudding?
Chow Bar. Denso e cremoso, gusto classico.
Ciao, bye. Wow, we are truly international now.
This is Italy's finest hot chocolate.
And where did- It is lovely.
Was this stolen from your nephew as well on the way out the door?
No, this one was stolen from George Clooney.
Oh. George is always going on about that.
Oh, his yacht bumped into yours and it flew onto your deck.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. No, we have a supplier who occasionally used to travel to Italy,
family member and they would always bring us back some gusto classica. Gusto classico. I've got to
get my pronunciation right. Really nice, really nice. But as much as I try at home to get it nice
and thick the way they do in the Italian cafes, I can never do it. Italian cafes, they get it so
thick that it's almost like... It looks like pudding. Mud. Yeah, it will... When you drink it
in Italy. It practically is like pudding. They somehow get this density of hot chocolate milk.
So amazingly done so well. I've never quite been able to replicate it here, but there you go.
Can I just say, I think you need to hold it up to the camera again. I need to get a screenshot of
this because you look like, here we go. I'm going to take a screenshot of Chow Bar with its official
brand ambassador, Andrew Canyon. Snap. Oh, that's beautiful. Now, I have a question for you about
Chowba or Chowba. Are you mixing it with- I was saying it Chow like it was goodbye. I don't think
it is that. I'm probably saying it Chowba. I don't know. Chowba. There you go, Chowba. Is this being
mixed with water or milk? Milk. Milk. Okay. Because I was saying sometimes those, you know, when you
have like those, what, Nescafe froth things and you just throw the powder in with water. But you're
doing it with milk. I'm doing it hardcore. Are they doing it with cream or something? I don't know.
They do it with- because they do it as part of it with their espresso machines as well.
So they get like really powerful frothing, heating oomph.
The closest I get is I put it in a thermomix, about seven minutes on 70 degrees with milk,
about 250 mils, 300 mils of milk per sachet.
That long. Stir it up, makes it warm.
Are you- are you using proper Italian cow milk?
Maybe that's your issue.
Well, this time I did try something a little bit different.
I managed to find in the shop the other day, it was on special.
It was cheaper than the normal milk, so I thought I'm gonna get that,
because I'm ever a bargain hunter.
I got extra creamy milk, which I sort of hoped might be the American version of half and half,
which is amazing.
It wasn't as thick and creamy as half and half, but it was very creamy.
So I've used that tonight in my job.
So wait, half and half is that's just the nice thing.
You don't have you don't have half and half.
No, I've looked everywhere.
Interesting.
Now we have lots of different silly milks, but can you clarify?
Sorry for my ignorance.
What's half and half again?
It's like half milk, half cream.
People survive drinking that on a daily basis.
No, it's only as like a, you would only put that in coffee or it's like a, it's like an
additive, not a, you wouldn't put that on like cereal or something.
Gotcha. Does it come in those little condiment thing as well?
It's like a little half container.
They're very small.
You'd usually get one like every so often.
It's not a beverage.
I would call it more of a, not a condiment, but an accessory to a beverage.
Nobody gave me those instructions. That's not how I used it.
No wonder you love it. You're just drinking straight cream out of a jar.
I would get those, um, you know, there's honey puff things, breakfast cereal,
honey puffs, sweetened puff things,
bowl of those, half and half milk all over them.
And that's what I would eat when I was in you should you should consult a heart doctor just to make sure everything's okay.
So good the second time I was going to the US so I did that the first time I went the second time I went over there that's what I was dreaming of like.
Before I got there was being able to eat that cereal with half and half milk.
It was amazing and I'm jealous of you Jason you could just wonder out well don't you wonder outside but you could certainly find a way of getting that stuff and making it today.
And he's clearly wasting that access is not even drinking it.
No no imagine that with a with a cup of Milo just like throw some Milo and a thing a half and half can you even imagine how great that would be.
American half-and-half Australian Milo because look American Milo whatever whatever you got shipped to your house that's.
That is now the official official beverage of this podcast.
So it's Milo and half-and-half.
If you insert a whisk as you did the electric whisk into half-and-half do you just end up with like a moose if Milo's added as well it ceases to be a beverage it's more like a dessert.
I think you just get a cup of mousse and a nap dessert.
Oh and while we're talking about beverages I can see in the show notes that we have the buy me a coffee reference coffee is a beverage do we have some thank yous.
Thank you.
Sure do.
Sure do.
Oh my goodness.
It's a good thing Stripe didn't cut off our payments like they cut off those to the Trump
campaign otherwise we'd be in big trouble.
Our revenue has gone through the roof.
We've got firstly I think there's two that I'd like to end.
There's one that I'll bring out bring attention to and I'll leave the thank you for the other
person to one of you guys.
But I particularly want to thank someone that's who they are.
There's someone they chose to remain anonymous.
They purchased three coffees, one for each of us.
This someone, though,
I think I've done a little bit of investigation.
I think I know who it is.
- Ooh.
- They tried to hide their email address.
They said like, "Don't spam me,"
or "Send me spam," something along those lines,
at spam.com.
It was classic, like, avoidance measure.
I approve of that.
There's no problem.
But I'm smarter than that.
So, Mr. Clooney, thank you for the three coffees.
We appreciate you having you as a listener.
I understand why you want to remain anonymous because you're a famous Hollywood actor.
Sure, we panned your movie, but you understood that we were talking straight.
So thank you.
Three coffees straight to us.
Thank you.
Imagine how many coffees we could have got if you gave him five stars.
Not into bribery though.
So happy about getting three coffees from George Clooney and now you've just destroyed
it.
I'm thinking we could have had more.
Wow.
No, no.
I apologize.
I retract that.
Thank you, Mr. Clooney, for your generosity.
In spite of your small bank account.
Watch out people, because I can dox anybody on the internet.
He's yeah, he's like, he's a real, uh, he's a real sleuth.
We also have someone that made George look a little bit light in the donation department.
We had somebody come through.
So George did three.
Pretty good.
I mean, you know, he's George.
He does what he can.
He did send me four cases of his tequila as well, but we don't need to talk about that.
The next person on the list bought so many coffees I had to use a calculator to figure
out how many coffees it was.
It was 10, 10 people, double digit coffee action is what that's called.
And that's where you want to be in your life.
You want to be someone that's known for double digit coffee action.
It's just - it's an achievement very few ever attain, but it should be what you look for
in 2021.
Who have we got to thank for so many coffees?
If only there were a way to find out because it says that their name is anonymized, which
is so strange. I just wish I knew someone that could find this information easily on
the internet.
Oh, I have a suspicion of who you might be talking about. Is it someone who shares the
same surname as mine?
Yes.
Ah, okay. Well, look, I'll take over this point. I have to thank my dear aunt, Francine,
who kindly donated to this show. I did not put any familial pressure on her, but
she is the relative I mentioned, I think, in our Tech Origin segment from an earlier episode about
infusing the Mac passion that burns within me now. So she's to thank for not only the coffees,
but also my nerddom, which is one third of this podcast. So thank you, Francine,
on behalf of the three of us. I want to thank, look, this person has named themselves Matthew
Gregg. $9. Thank you. Thank you, Matthew. It's incredible because I don't know how to put this,
but it's amazingly gratifying that people even listen, but listen to the point and then listen
to the point of enjoying and then think, you know what? I enjoy it so much, I'm going to
buy them a coffee. That's incredibly generous and in a world that's gone a bit topsy-turvy recently,
it's that kind of thing that is really nice. It's heartwarming. Much appreciated. Yeah. And I just
logged in to buy me a coffee, guys. I don't know if you've looked at this in the last couple of
days or had any notifications. There is, oh my goodness, there is a fourth donation. What the
What the heck?
Will it ever stop?
I hope not.
Wow, this hemispheric telethon just keeps on going.
Who do we have now?
I had no idea about this, but a certain mother of a certain podcaster from this show has
gone back again for more and has bought us all another coffee.
The mom cast is strong because I want to thank my mom, Jennifer, who's back at the well,
has bought us another three coffees.
Oh my goodness.
these coffees plus the donation of a microphone to you this is just this blow it up
yes and i think we have a main topic that you've put down andrew about what appears to be chat
apps have you signed up for all four chat apps simultaneously that you have written down here
or you have thoughts on each of them well it's interesting i look at the run sheet somebody's
been playing with my little um my trello card here because i wrote whatsapp i wrote signal i
I wrote Telegram. I came back later and I see something that I've never even heard of.
Threema? Who did that? What the heck? I know. What is Threema?
So, so Signal, I mean,
I'm assuming you put this on there because of this whole
re-discovery of Signal by the world, apparently.
Thanks to, I'm sure, thanks to Rocket Boy, I would imagine talking about it.
Yeah, I was actually glad you put this on here because I was curious a what you both think of all of these from
your world perspective compared to where I'm at I
Seems pretty obvious from where I'm at why people are using that these things right now all of the sudden
I think they've been popular. What's up? So just to get this straight. What's app is is
is the Facebook is like one of Facebook's 37 different messaging platforms that they
have, right?
Yes, signal is owned by no one.
Well, I mean, it's, you know, open source, yada, yada, yada, insert all your licensing
here.
Telegram, I don't really know the background of Telegram.
I think that one is based in Europe somewhere, I think.
I think it's the Middle East.
Oh, is it?
Okay.
And then Threema is another one.
I added that one just because that was one that I had heard of/used quite a while ago
and I always thought they had an interesting kind of twist on the whole thing.
And maybe a twist is a bad thing in this arena, but the Threema, and I'm probably going to
explain this incorrectly.
I don't, I'm not like a daily user or anything, but they always had this, this idea of these
three different dots where you had the one dot meaning you were basically in
contact with someone so it could be basically trusted that that's who you
were talking to. Then there was like two dots meaning you somehow swapped some
kind of credential with each other so it was it was more like you knew that's who
it was. And then the third dot I believe was effectively you both met in person
and like scanned a QR code or something. So it was like, I now have visual confirmation
that this is the person I'm talking to. So it was kind of this three layers of being
assured that you were in fact talking to this person. It was always a little, I don't know,
spy kind of TV show ish back in, you know, five years ago, 10 years ago, whenever this
But it seemed like an interesting thought that just because it's a secure chat platform
Doesn't mean you know who the hell's on the other side. I mean that it's like
Faxing someone where yeah, it's a secure fact
I mean well faxing is not secure, but you don't know who's picking that thing up out of the other end
You have no idea
So I just thought that was an interesting idea
But now it seems that we're back into the it kind of comes in waves
I feel like at least here in the US these secure end-to-end chat apps where people get real excited about them
But everybody signs up for them and then they realize
This isn't really doing anything for me
And then they kind of fall off again and then something happens where some company leaks a bunch of data
So now we're back onto the whole secure chat thing
The only thing I'll just say real quick is for me
The end-to-end thing I think is great
I just feel like put that into the things we're already using instead of having another layer of thing to use so I
Don't personally use any of these
day to day
Unless somebody says they need to talk to me through one of those which is not really a thing that's happening
I still just vainly use I message for everything or
Or like discord it would be another one, but I don't know what what about both of you
Maybe Andrew you start is is are these a thing and oh yes, they're a thing in Australia
But is this something like here where it kind of goes in waves or does no one care about any of this?
Look, I think I think like everything
WhatsApp probably really owns the space
They've got the power of Facebook and the power of ubiquity across both platforms
I think the thing that is most noticeable here and I think it disappoints me in a way is that
I message or messages or whatever you want to call it is not it's not on the my list
I use it, but it's really limited to just Apple people
As soon as you try and go cross-platform you you fall back to
Green bubble SMS stuff as far as I can tell I think that's all it is still MMS SMS
So it doesn't really work and it doesn't have all the
The additional add-ons like giphy's and all those sorts of things that work well across
Non Apple devices, so it's kind of a non-starter even though I would prefer to just run everything through that
But yeah, whatsapp has been the predominant one like I know I've got I've had friend chats in it I've had
Family groups in there because you know that everybody has it
However, over the last couple of weeks and what pushed me to looking for a change, I've
had Signal and Telegram accounts from a while ago, probably like you said, Jason, one of
those previous waves where I investigated and tried to find a different alternative
to Facebook, but I didn't get any traction.
So they kind of went by the wayside.
What I found interesting though, is that since WhatsApp released its new terms of service,
There's been a genuine like awareness that maybe Facebook's a bit creepy and this is
by people who aren't in the tech world at all.
So I've had success in moving a friend group over to Signal and my family group over to
Signal.
There was a bit of consternation about it but somehow it managed to happen.
I did catch up with my mates last weekend and I offered a white glove concierge installation
service to help a couple of them install the app and get it up and running.
And I copped a lot of hassle and I'm still getting it on the message board about, "Ah,
couldn't we have just stuck with WhatsApp?"
Yada yada.
But it's all good natured and I think we've had success in moving it over.
I actually then went and I've deleted my WhatsApp account.
I've uninstalled the app.
I've deleted Telegram.
I'm just sticking with now iMessage messages and Signal.
- What made you pick Signal over Telegram?
Was it the security model or whatever?
Or was it just the user interface?
Or what made you pick one?
- Yeah, I think it was probably a bit of both.
It seemed to be, and I'm no cybersecurity expert,
but it seemed to me that Signal had at least a reputation of better security or stronger
security than Telegram.
Realistically for what we're doing, we're not organizing any riots or anything like
that.
So that we know of.
Through a vectors of, you will never know now.
But yes, I don't think that's a real, but I think a real problem, but I think the Signal
interface just kind of seemed a bit friendlier.
I actually didn't like Telegram because it looked so much like WhatsApp.
And I actually don't like the UI of WhatsApp.
And Telegram seemed to totally just ape it.
It was like a Samsung copy of Apple.
Signal at least seems to be trying its own look and feel a little bit.
And I thought it was a bit nicer.
And the fact that other people had now heard of Signal helped with that transition.
You know, so other people were getting on board and that was probably because of Elon.
But who cares what the vector is?
Like the less Facebook in our lives, the better.
So yeah, that's where I'm seeing it from.
But overall in society in Australia, WhatsApp is still far and away the strongest as far
as I can tell.
The only one of those apps that I've had any experience with was Telegram and that's because
I was invited to speak with other people online and I didn't have too much of a problem with
the app.
this kind of begrudging, you know, it's good to have this variety of competitors or different chat alternatives, but I just found myself being
frustrated by being pulled in all these different directions like now like you two I
Mainly rely on messages with Apple people or relatives or close friends
There are only a couple of Android holdouts out there who make me use something else
Telegram I didn't mind too much. I've never had a whatsapp account funnily enough
My first real knowledge of that came from hearing that apparently it was like the app for Germans
because of my German cultural interest and
They loved it because of privacy and like you said these waves come through of people being enthusiastic about new alternatives or being worried about how
Companies like Facebook are being creepy the moment that the Germans heard that Facebook was getting whatsapp
They just started tearing their hair out. Like what are we gonna do? This is not good because they've always been really
privacy aware and focused.
But what do you both think about apps like,
one that isn't on here is Keybase.
What do you think of Keybase?
- I used, I still have a Keybase account.
I'm kind of on the fence about it now
since they got bought by Zoom.
And it was a very odd situation.
The company that kept getting kind of thrown out
in the dumpster because of security things
then bought Keybase, which is their whole thing is security and privacy and
encrypted messaging and so forth.
So I'm assuming they bought it just, it was a, you know, to get the people so
that they could then put those people onto their actual, you know, bread and
butter is where they're making all their money.
Um, but now that it's with them, I feel like best case, it's just kind of going
to linger and not ever do anything else.
I don't see them saying,
now we are a video conferencing company
and a weird obscure identity service on the internet.
It's just like, if I were them as a company
and running Zoom, I don't really feel like I would say
this is our core competency.
We probably need to just get these people over here
and get rid of this other thing.
So I don't really care.
I think the messaging part of Keybase was always pretty weak anyway, but what I liked
about Keybase was the idea of proven identity, and I've never found anything else...
If anyone listening to this knows of something else, please let me know, but I've never found
anything else like the part of Keybase related to identity.
So if you go to my Keybase page, you can see that this website is absolutely owned by me
because I had to go in and put in a text thing into DNS, blah blah blah blah blah.
Anyway, proving that I actually own that domain.
And the same goes for Bitcoin addresses.
It just seems like there's nothing out there right now saying, "Prove to me that this is
your website."
There's no way to really do that other than something like this.
But anyway, Keybase, yeah, I still have an account really just for that identity stuff.
And that's about it.
Yeah, because using it, I like that identity part as well.
But every time I opened it, it felt like the app was being constructed in front of my eyes.
And I know that's a very snobbish aesthetic thing.
And it probably comes down to it being an electron app or something.
But it kind of offended me.
I thought, okay, this app is under construct.
Oh, no, it's ready now.
Thank you.
But an app that I've had to use with relative in China is WeChat.
And we all know that's not, let's say, the secure or certain chat application that we
might say that others are.
And it's actually possible to give people money like Chinese tradition, for example.
I think it's around New Year or something.
So I might be butchering what I'm saying.
But I found that with the money that was received, it was a small amount.
wasn't wasted. Essentially, once it arrived within your WeChat account, it was go to the nearest
China bank something or other or make sure you have an account and then you can extract and I've
gone, well, I'm not in the mainland and I don't have an account. So that money is lost. So there
are, I think, total, you know, worlds out there like WeChat that we don't even think about as
Westerners where you just get sucked into this vortex or this ecosystem that we don't even think
about. I often reflect on the fact that I am very iMessage centric. And if only those two or three
Android friends would cross over, I'd never have to use anything else. But then you think, wow,
that's the totalitarian alternative of just living within WeChat. And do we want that either? So,
I think we want a few different alternatives. WeChat is a full platform. I mean, you can purchase
everything through it. You can, it's, it's, I kind of feel like it's an,
it's what AOL always wanted to be where you just go into and what Facebook wants
to be now,
where you go into WeChat and you don't leave.
You just do everything there. You, you exchange money, you chat,
you do all your grocery shopping, you buy all your tech gadgets.
Everything runs through WeChat,
which sounds super cool and convenient,
but also sounds kind of like, is that good?
The only, the only platform I've found that's more all encompassing than,
um, than WeChat is, uh, Tom Nook,
Nook Incorporated, man. He's just all over it.
You get his Nook phone, you get Nook Miles, you get Nook.
Oh man, Tom Nook. He takes care of your mortgage. Martin,
you're looking a little bit befuddled, but, um.
No, no, I'm just- I'm not as familiar with this as you clearly are.
Have you dipped your toes into this Nook world or you're just reading about it?
No, no, no. I've- my kids got Animal Crossing for Christmas for the Switch.
And-
He says his kids got it, but-
Yeah.
Ever since.
I think we know what that means.
Ever since I've been- I practically sold my own body to get 30 pieces of iron to be able to build a shop.
Like, I'm trying to build a house. I don't know why I want some of the wooden artifacts that I can
craft and then I craft them and I'm left with like, well, now what do I do with it? I just look at it.
It's totally pointless. So, I'll go back to watering my flowers and picking my pumpkins.
Yeah, but Tom Nook, yeah, Tom Nook/WeChat. They're the two you need to watch out for.
Global domination. You were talking about imaginary pumpkins there, right? You know,
this hasn't bled into real life and you've got like a garden or something happening.
It may as well be look I'm doing more work and doing more effort in this imaginary world than I do in my own garden.
Ridiculous.
Some people watch gardening Australia you play Animal Crossing.
But Jason came to visit my- Jason visited my island and the most frightening thing was not only was he like a million levels ahead of me in the game but he actually looked like him right now like he had headphones on,
He had the same hairstyle. He came cruising into my island like Puff Daddy.
It's just like, yo, what's up?
Technological hoarding.
I thought you'd both have something to say about this.
As a bit of context, it came up in my mind again because I just had a brief holiday, you know, Christmas time, bit of leave, back to work now, which is all good.
but during that time period, that short period, I was doing some cleanup, you know, old clothes,
things in the wardrobe and so on. And the one thing that always is immune to serious cleaning
is digital devices. Now, I don't think that I have a huge problem. Others may think that I do.
I don't have a lot of stuff lying around. It's not all collecting dust. It's not falling out
onto my head when I try to reach for something else. But there is a bit of a timeline. There
are layers, okay? There are different things happening from different time periods. And
I wanted to know if both of you have the same sort of problem getting rid of things. Do you
have a separate space? And to kick off, I'll say, look, I have a small box of various portable
devices. I have a larger box that has things like an old iPad or two and like a tangerine iBook.
And then up on that bookshelf up there that you can't see, currently three desktop Macs.
Now, I know Jason, you have your shelf, which we can see at the moment,
and you're zooming in with your Carl Zeiss lens.
But yeah, now we can see curtains and various framed items. Very good. Yeah. So, I mean,
I have different places for things, but do you both have to deal with this same issue?
Andrew, because I can still see you, let's go for you first.
Yeah, ironically, all the stuff that I wish I had hoarded, I haven't. So that's like our previous
episode where we talked about our old technology. I wish I'd hoarded that stuff, but at the time it
just got turfed. There was no perceived value in any of it. So you just chucked it when as
because it was obsolete. I would love to have all that stuff now. But with my newer stuff,
I just have, you know how in the, you go to a hardware store and you can just buy those sort of
of big plastic tubs that have a plastic lid on them that break whenever you try and move
them.
I have one or two of those and it's just like, they started off as just my random cables
went in there and then the odd laptop got put in there and now it's just become the
technology graveyard.
But it's not treated in any wonderful way, it's just stuff that I'm not using anymore
tends to get chucked into that.
It's quite random, so it's got some iPads in there,
couple of them have broken screens, couple of them don't.
It's got an old airport, Airport Express,
it's got an iPod or two.
So just all my random stuff
and some extension cords and cables and what have you,
all just end up in these buckets
and those buckets live upstairs in the attic.
And I occasionally discover them
when I'm looking for a HDMI cable or something.
And that's about it.
I don't treat them with any great respect.
So you, you've got these plastic tubs with the easy break handles. Great feature.
Do you find yourself putting products in there out of sentimentality to begin
with, or is it,
I'm going to deal with that and I don't really want to put into landfill or how
can I recycle it? Why do things end up there?
Yeah, it's cause, mainly because I don't,
I'm attached to them sentiment in a sentimental way.
And yeah, I don't want them just getting,
I don't want to put them in the bin,
'cause yeah, they've just got a landfill
and pollute everything.
And then, but I think I could take them back
and be recycled, but what's the value
of them being recycled versus having them
so that maybe I can show my kids when they're older
and I can say, look at this hilarious thing we used to use.
Isn't it a piece of junk?
So I kind of just, it's that sentimental sort of approach.
And like I discovered the other day, an old iPhone,
And I just held the iPhone 3GS or whatever it was in my hand.
And it was just like, oh, that's right.
That's what this felt like.
And it took me back in my mind to that era.
What was I doing?
I remember when, you know, and remember when I first got this and it was so amazing.
And, you know, just so it just triggers memories almost.
It's like a little time machine in a box.
Yeah. And it does highlight, I mean, you think each year, oh, you know, things don't really change as massively as they do now,
particularly with mature product lines like the iPhone,
but then you look back just a few years
when you do keep that stuff and it's a monumental shift.
It's huge.
I mean, bezels alone in the last few years.
Jason, you were teasing us with a big box,
a big Apple product box for an iBook G3.
Was there actually an iBook in there or was it hollow?
- Oh no, it's got everything in it.
It's every original thing.
It's as if it were just purchased from the store.
Wow, that's incredible.
Yeah.
I have a list in my reminders of all the old crap that I'm trying to acquire.
You're a genuine collector.
I guess so, yeah.
I don't, I mean, I think, I mean, people collect everything, right?
Some people collect spoons, some, you know, little porcelain things from traveling.
I think I don't keep them because they're useful, because they're certainly not useful.
I mean, an iBook, a Tangerine iBook is by no means useful,
but I think I more collect them
because of what they look like more than anything.
And I think like you were saying,
how the phone changes incrementally over time,
but altogether it's actually pretty interesting
how much they have actually changed.
So that's why I collect them.
And it's also sentiment as well.
Like, why do I have a two-way pager from like 1995 or whatever?
Like who gives a shit about that?
But I've, every time I look at it, I immediately remember back to when I first
had that, and that was like the first line of two-way communication past just
getting a number on a pager and having to call it back, but actually being able to
message.
So it's, it's really just things tied to memories for the most part.
I don't keep everything but definitely more than I should I would say and like I said, I'm where do these things go?
So now in our in our new house, we actually have space for this kind of stuff
So like all my phones I have on one big shelf next to my desk
Down in the basement in one of the rooms down there is where the majority of the other stuff lives
And then some other stuff just kind of randomly depending on size
It'll go wherever like this box just is in the an office right now
There's also a g
for
12 inch power book in there as well that one actually works still and I've been keeping that one going
Just because it's kind of fun to boot up, you know early early Mac OS and go. Wow, that is
Really aqua licious
So yeah, a lot of a lot of hoarding going on
It's interesting that both both me and Jason have reflected on it being a vector back into our memories
And I wonder if that is that
Did previous generations have other things that serviced?
That that that purpose
I think so
So I think it was just much, there was a much more limited supply probably in terms of what
those objects could be.
You know, it might be a piece of dishware or a small, you know, clothing or hat or something.
Whereas now with our increasingly ridiculous amount of stuff that is made and is possible,
that just, that list just grew exponentially.
I mean, you collect what is available, right?
I think it's, I don't, I don't think it's related to hunter gatherer, but whatever there
is to be had, I think we naturally just start to collect and form patterns out of it.
I, I, I don't know.
I mean, that's my, that's my professional psychological opinion.
I think we're ultimately, we're all just bower birds, aren't we?
we collect things that make us feel good. And in our instances, that's technological stuff,
even though it has little shiny things to build our nests.
I don't know what you two think about this, but I've, um, I'm not trying to get rid of
older things because those sentimental memories are attached, particularly the older stuff. But
the last two iPhones that I had prior to this 12 mini that's sitting next to me right now,
I traded in for recycling to get a discount. So Jason, are you all right with that? Given that
you have a shelf of history next to you? Oh, yeah. I mean, I fully recognize that I'm
a complete idiot for having all of these phones on a stupid shelf when, you know,
the number of people that have pointed out, like, you have a, why is that just sitting,
like, why are you not selling that or whatever? But I think a lot of, a lot of it is now I just,
I have so much of the collection, like, I just want to have all of it. But it's like, you know,
I'm collecting Pokemon cards or something, but the resale of them, usually, and I guess
we have a little bit of a benefit because generally my wife and I both have whatever
phone is the phone.
So usually we'll sell, or generally we don't really sell anything, we just hand it down.
So it'll be so-and-so's aunt or brother-in-law, sister-in-law, whatever is on a three-way
three year old one, so it's like, okay, now you get the 11 Pro for some ridiculous price that's great.
So usually we'll get rid of one of them and then we'll just keep the other one for whatever reason.
For my shelf is the reason.
But I mean, I probably should trade them in. I don't really sell stuff online anymore
just because it's just such a pain in the ass. Everyone that is online trying to buy stuff
just sucks. I mean, it's like
It's just it's such an awful experience every service out there is terrible. You know you put something up that for a fair price
It's like I would like $100 for this and then somebody's like I'll give you $3
Take it or leave it and it's like what do you okay?
Bye
Speaking of hoarding there's one bit of technology that I wish to no longer hoard which is an 27 inch cinema display
It's still in it's still in mint condition, but it's non retina
It's the mini display port do you have the box no I don't my wife made me
Is this the one that's still costing you money in your asset depreciation spreadsheet? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
I've got it in the spreadsheet exactly so I need to offload this thing
And I tried to sell online and so far. It's been total bust I had somebody asking me if I could shift to Sydney
Martin was that you
Not worth my
How am I going to ship it to Sydney?
Like I don't have the box.
It's no, no.
And then somebody else now asking me, is that the one that plugs into Thunderbolt?
And it's like, eh, no, it's mini DisplayPort.
So I don't think I'm going to get rid of this thing.
I think it's stuck with me.
But it's just too good.
I've looked after it so well.
There's not a scratch on it.
The best thing that happens is somebody will – you'll finally come to a deal and then
you'll go to meet them and they won't show up, first of all, or they show up and then
say it was 50 bucks and they go, "Will you take 40?"
And it's like, "We're not negotiating anymore.
This is done.
We already agreed on the price.
No, I won't."
And then the other great thing is you maybe finally get rid of something and then they
have the gall to contact you for tech support on something.
This happened to me.
I sold a monitor.
Yeah, I sold a monitor to somebody for, I think it was like maybe $50 or something.
It was like a 20 inch touchscreen monitor, nothing special.
Just didn't need it.
Sold it to the guy.
Great.
Contacts me like three days later and he's like, so I'm having some issues with the drivers
on blah, blah, blah.
I'm like, are you actually kidding me?
You're, how is this okay in your brain?
How did this happen in your head?
And you thought, yeah, I'm gonna contact that person
that I got this monitor for close to nothing for.
- He heard you on a podcast and he thought,
that guy knows what he's talking about.
- Yeah, yeah, which brings me to my final rant of,
I really feel like when we're doing job interviews
for people, when you're looking to hire somebody,
Like screw resumes, resumes are bullshit.
Everyone knows that.
We need to be looking at what is their rating
on like Craigslist and all these services.
Did they show up on time for the deal?
Did they try to screw the person
that they were purchasing it from?
I think we're gonna learn a lot more about people
from these interactions than a stupid resume.
Because I can tell you, most people out there,
late to meetings, I bet those are the same people
that don't show up to buy something on Craigslist,
wasting other people's time, trying to lowball.
Those are the people on your sales team
that are low performers.
I bet it's a one-to-one ratio.
That's all I'm saying.
(upbeat music)
In fact, as I mentioned earlier,
that I offered to my friends a concierge service
to install Signal.
Can I suggest to everybody out there,
a concierge service to subscribe to Hemispheric Views?
Just take the phone, subscribe them up.
Did you did you tell them you did this or did you just, was that just a little bonus for them?
I actually didn't do it.
Which is stupid in hindsight.
I probably had a few beers and I wasn't thinking clearly.
But that would be a great thing for anybody to do, really, is just sign random people up.
And look, the first 30 subscribers or people who say that they'll subscribe will receive a personal visit from Andrew Kenyon with White Gloves.
will break COVID laws to visit you interstate or in your nation of choice and he will actually
subscribe on your podcast player of choice. Is that right, Andrew? Is that financially feasible,
CFO? Yeah, yeah, unless you're using Apple podcasts, in which case, no, because that's
a piece of junk app. Get something good. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I use Apple podcasts
Religiously now it's the best one it has no features
And you never know what you're downloading or listening to next or anything. It makes no sense
The feature is the lack of features
Is the time for me to try it again? Oh my god the last time I tried it was terrible
I just I feel like at this point and this is maybe kind of
Application wide in my whole life. I'm kind of just tired of extra bull like all the
I think Castro is beautiful. The Q thing is great. And I finally for some reason realized like
It's not really doing anything. It's just going to a different instead of coming in on one screen
It's on a different screen that I have to go look at and delete instead of just deleting it from the main screen
So it's actually one extra step. It's not really saving me any steps and
Then the other one is like the orange one is it's fine. I just I don't really need any of it
Like all the skip silence and all that.
I've been using the Apple podcast one for,
I don't know, maybe a couple of months now.
I don't even notice.
I don't, the silence skipping, the speed boost
and all that, I don't really notice
that it's even there or not.
I don't really care.
And it's not like you got it anyway, if you're on the Mac.
I mean, you guys do now that you have M1 Mac,
so you can use, I'm assuming all that,
yeah, 'cause it's the same app, right?
All the voice boost and all that stuff would still work,
But I don't know, I just feel like it's, you know, play the audio.
The main feature of my Plex library these days, because I lost most of my content in
a hard drive disaster, so I don't have much anymore.
But my favorite section is using Jason's YouTube DL scripting stuff and it filters into my
favorite named Plex library.
It's called DrewTube.
DrewTube.
Yes.
I love it.
YouTube videos coming into DrewTube minus the ads.
Love it.
So Drew, obviously short for Anne Drew, is that a name that you had when you were younger
as like a nickname?
Is that a nickname that you have now?
Or is that one of those situations where you have like three people that you know that
still call you that and everyone else is like, "Why are you calling me that?"
Yeah, I have like circle circles.
So my family nickname when I was a kid and I still get called by my family is Andy.
I'm using that I'm using that only to the family Andy Andy we're all family mates
but all my basketball mates and like guys have grown up with since I was a bit older was I'm either drew or drewy.
Anything in a work setting is always just Andrew.
But I've always longed for a really cool nickname.
Never had someone at the Grand Canyon or something like that.
Oh, yeah, you know what I mean, like their own naff.
I love the word naff.
You like the word naff, Jason?
I love naff.
Yeah, because to me when I hear it, it sounds so much worse than any like swear word you
could use.
But yet it's just like no big deal.
You wouldn't even have to bleep it.
Yeah, you're like, oh, that's naff versus like that is shit.
see now I have to put a thing there.
Yeah, you're going to have to.
So Andrew, just before I asked Jason, if he ever had any nicknames or other names
with family, what do you claim?
Do you want, if you had to choose, if you had to be given a nickname that summed
up who you are or who you want to be, what's it going to be?
Jeez.
I have no idea.
Um, I dunno.
I got nothing.
I've got nothing.
This is the problem, right?
I've had 40 odd years to think about this
and I've still not come up with anything.
- Well, you've got until the next episode
until then I'm calling you Andy.
See you in the discord.
- Oh, you've done wrong.
- Jason, any nicknames?
- Oh, Andy.
Let's see.
So for me, I don't really have any nicknames now.
I mean, nothing that people say in front of me.
I'm sure I have other ones, you know,
but sometimes people call me Andy.
Other times it's,
sometimes it'll be,
I guess mostly when I was a teenager, it was just J.
And I don't know if that was just the letter J or J-A-Y.
Really it was more of a verbal thing.
Jace sometimes, which is like the worst.
I think my mom says that one a lot.
I'm just like, just like either stick with the first letter
or do the whole thing.
This middle thing is just not really working out.
And that's really it.
I guess, well, in the military,
everyone calls people by their last name.
That kind of just becomes your name.
Mostly just 'cause it's written
on all your uniforms and stuff.
So that was for a good number of years was just Burke.
So if I suddenly say, "Burke, give me ten!" Is that a trigger?
Probably. Just start crying. I'll just start crying.
Do you find an Australian voice has more or less authority
than an American voice if that's barked at you?
It sounds a little less threatening.
"Oi mate, give me ten. Beers, that is." Something like that.
Like, "Eh, all right."
Shall do. I'm on it. I'll never forget the - I have a lot of repressed memories from those times,
but one that is like just always sticks out in my mind is the one time I accidentally - I was
getting talked to very closely. I don't want to say talked to, but it was very - it was pretty loud.
Like right in the face, just talking, talking, talking. And there's a lot of, as you would
imagine yes sirs yes ma'am you know fairly common you would hope i accidentally this was early on i
i actually i accidentally did a yes sir to a ma'am she the things that she said she was going to do
to me with my own arm were very troubling to say the least. And that's
that's one of those things you'll just never forget. So always make sure you say
the correct sir and/or ma'am or other whatever it is just make sure you use
the right one is what I'm saying or else your arm may be used against you in a very
violent way. Do you think she was genuine genuinely upset or is it just a culture
thing. It's like, I'm just going to remind him in the future not to make this mistake.
I kind of feel like it's, I feel like it's both. I think it's a little bit of a culture
thing that bleeds into you've been doing it so long it becomes real life kind of a thing.
And also it's a great example for everyone else that's around that you don't want to
be that guy. Don't be that guy. And I guarantee that made, there was no less than probably
30 people that saw that and were probably going to do something terrible at some point
and thought, "Hmm, maybe I won't.
Maybe I'll get in line like everyone else."
Anyway, that was Military Corner.
I can see why you stayed there.
Yeah, I'm a lifer, obviously.
So I'm now going to call you.
I've got a nickname now, right?
I've got it.
You are now- Go ahead, Andy.
You're now G.I.
Burke.
Hmm. Well, GI Jace, we can work either way.
Oh, that's probably better actually.
GI Jace.
Oh, Andy, you're really, really pushing the buttons today.
I'm sure you've heard it before.
Martin, who are you?
Look, the funny thing is, other than some much more recent use by certain family members
or maybe a couple of colleagues. There's the occasional Marty or Feldy but yeah.
But the funny thing is that by everyone and I mean everyone all through my
schooling you know well out of school I was always called Martin and in a rather
formal way and I can never really work out whether that's because people just
like the name or if it was some sort of burn for my from what I've been told
general formal way that I speak. Yes, I would say that.
Yeah. Martin.
Martin. That's right. Natasha's always said Martin back to me because if we're in the same room or
just across the house, I won't just yell "Oi" and then the sentence will just start speaking. I'll
say "Natasha" and everyone calls her Tasha and she goes "Yes, Martin." And I'm like, "Oh, damn."
So, it's like this soft burn within the family that I'm always being formally addressed in return.
So, I could see that. That seems like one of those situations where everyone kind of turns
and is like, let's see what Martin has to say about this.
Exactly. Yeah. So that's sort of it. I mean, one person at work does occasionally call me
Fonzie because I have a thing with fonts. Oh, Fonzie.
Yeah, not Fonzie. Is that like a play on Fonzie?
Or just? Yeah. Yeah. Like Fonzie.
So that comes up occasionally. But really, I suppose the best thing is that I've just always
been stuck with Martin, which I don't really have an issue with. Although some people,
and in fact, I remember I said this to Natasha early on in our relationship and made her super
paranoid and I've felt sorry about it ever since. But I made some comment early on when I said,
you know, I've noticed that people really don't enunciate the T properly.
They swallow the T and they say Martin and she went, oh, okay. And she told me that she started,
she was worried about saying my name early on because she went, I'm not going to say it
properly. I'm just gonna blurt it out in some casual address rather than Martin. I'm like,
damn. You don't say the R either. So what does that do for you? When I say Martin,
because you say Martin. Yeah. Well, now you've gotten into the erotic and non-erotic R's.
That's just a cultural difference. That sounds like a topic.
So does Martin sound, is that different to you? Does that sound or is it just, I just say it weird?
Oh, look, look, this is one big after show for you to edit Andrew. Look, as far as American
accents go, I don't know what, Andrew probably agrees with this, but you can rebut,
they sound totally normal on television, right? Or anything that you're watching. But the moment an
American is in the room with you, you go, there they are. It really stands out. So,
you sound totally normal right now and you would in the room, of course, but the moment those
R's and the, it sounds like you're really letting people know exactly every single letter that
you're saying. Yeah. Like I know letters. You don't, you don't judge me. Yeah, I get it.
Exactly. But it does have its advantages because I remember I used the word
pass as in P-A-R-S-E once with other people.
And they thought I was saying P-A-S-S because in Australia,
that'd be exactly the same word.
Pass.
Passing what? No, no, no. Like porous. And they went,
we still don't understand what you're talking about.
So there are some advantages to your way of speaking.
Porous. Okay. I mean,
Marty's not even that bad because all I think of is Back to the Future,
which is awesome. So it's like.
What's with the life preserver? That's right.
It's not as bad as Andy.
No, so we need to improve it.
Do you ever get called Feldmeister?
I actually gave myself that nickname on my senior jumper at school.
People thought it was all right.
Well, I'm not going to give you that nickname.
To my face at least.
I'm going to try and do the Australian thing and go for a strange.
Sort of diametric nickname.
How about Corey?
Corey.
You know the first thing I think of? There's like a Simpsons moment where Lisa's obsessed with the Corey hotline, and all he does is say things that rhyme with his own name, like Allegory and Montessori.
The reason I get the Corey is because you're the Feldman.
Right.
Right.
Which is, and the Feldman is Corey Feldman, the actor.
So you're Corey.
Right.
So Corey.
I don't even know who this person is.
You don't know Corey Feldman?
I don't think so.
I know Marty Feldman.
Who's Marty Feldman?
Oh, like classic comic actor with the really big googly eyes that he could pop out of his
head.
See, now we're both googly.
What the hell just happened?
All right, Corey Feldman.
I'm going to stick with Martin and Andrew. I'm going to just going to go with that. That
seems easy.
You do you, GI Chase.
Deleting my recording.
When was he born?
1971.
He does have pug eyes.
Yeah.
That's a good sign. Friendship with Michael Jackson.
I mean that gives you bonus points right out of the gate.
what you're looking for in life really. All right well given that I heaped it all on you
just there Andrew with Andy I'm just going to have to take what I get. Hey he was a heartthrob
I'll just tell you that okay there were the two Cory's there was Cory Feldman, Cory Haim
and I could not get a look in with the girls in my school because I wasn't one of those
Cory's so you know you're doing okay. Well okay well I'm happy to be the hemispheric
heartthrob, we'll put it that way.
There it is!
