I've got a new audio hijack editing feature plugged in.
Uh oh.
So if I push this button on my stream deck.
New year new you.
Nobody heard anything right?
No.
No.
I didn't hear it either but apparently into my audio track was recorded a clap.
Is that good?
So is that a good thing that you have a thing being recorded that you can't hear?
I don't know if I'll use it or not but it's just nice to know somebody swears.
I can go clap and it'll go into the audio.
Will that help Martin or is Martin just freaking out?
Wait, what?
Well, I'm editing this one, so does that mean that I'm going to hear something when I hear
your recording?
You're going to hear claps?
Only when I push the button.
Like that.
So press it now.
Okay.
Did you do it then?
Yep.
We hear nothing.
I know, but I see the orange lines go into my audio file.
Oh, no.
Oh, so this is like a marker?
Yeah.
Did you, hold on, did you record your own clap and then use that as the sound?
No, I downloaded it from somewhere.
Oh, okay.
I was hoping you just threw like a blanket over yourself and try to get like the perfect clap that you could use for your own sound effect.
That would be great.
Isn't it strange that he went and downloaded someone else's clap rather than doing his own?
Feels a bit dirty.
Whose clap is this?
We don't know anything about this person.
Can you choose customized claps?
Like, I want a slightly moist hand that's smaller than usual.
I'm just enjoying the idea of Martin editing and just like bloody Andrew and his claps.
Shit.
Oh, sorry.
Hang on.
There we go.
I can't wait until one of them makes it in that doesn't get edited out.
Well, I want to extend a happy new year to both of you,
because this is the first time that we've actually recorded in the new year.
And I want to extend a happy new year to all listeners.
And sorry that 2022 will be starting off with some weird editing
that may introduce claps one of my new year's resolutions was to make the editing task as difficult as possible for button solved mission successful.
Why is that what can we go into that just briefly why is that it's just an Australian screwing with another Australian isn't it sounds like it's what we do I see.
Coast vs East Coast I'm trying to be friends here I'm trying to avoid WA succeeding or something you know.
He's trying to bring you guys together.
See, we succeed when we secede.
See, that's just mean-spirited, Andrew.
We're trying to be one federation here.
Is that tautological?
One federation?
You federate to make one?
Anyway.
Dictionary corner, another time.
So it's safe to say there's still turmoil between East and West in Australia.
That's great.
Apparently.
Anyway, I'm pretty sure, getting straight into things,
Jason, I can see in the show notes here,
we have a new patron person you're normally a patron announcer so what you want to say.
Patreon announcement 2022 edition yes Zack W has slid in to the new role of.
One prime plus extraordinaire.
It's in the game.
Yeah so thank you Zack W.
Can I ask a question just a clarification.
Yes.
Is that Zack W or Zack UU?
I believe it is Zach double you.
Okay so double V.
Yeah like WA it's WA yeah so Zach we'll just call him Zach WA.
Why is double why is W not double V why is it W?
What could that have more to do with the typeface that's being used or perhaps the fact that it was named in a time where handwriting would have seen two curves they actually would have looked like you.
Would they have curved it? Okay, okay, they didn't, they weren't fans of the acute angle.
In lowercase I do a little curve and then in uppercase I do the point.
Yeah, of course, I have to think back to the era of pen.
Yeah, remember when they didn't have computers back then? That's probably when that started. I think letters were created prior to computers, I believe.
I love that we're dealing with the big issues right off the bat in 2022. Why are letters called letters? Why is it H and not H?
Oh, don't.
Yeah, I hate that. It's H. No one. It's not H, please.
Yes, Zach. If you say H, I'm sorry.
Oh, no.
I'm not having you anymore.
We had Zach for like a day and now he's already gone. Sorry, Zach. Please, please don't leave.
Anyway, thank you for joining us, Zach. Thank you, Zach.
And for everyone else listening, if you're not in one prime plus,
remember that we did reconfigure the prices last year to broaden access,
you know, make it easier, more affordable to sign up.
And things like the newsletter that'll be going out this month.
The 10th of every month newsletter action.
Sweet stickers.
Awesome discord with really fun people.
Get in there now.
Make it your 2022.
What are those things that people do at the beginning?
Resolutions.
Yeah, the matrix resolutions. That's right. Your your 2022 matrix resolution should be
one prime plus.com.
Hello, this is Martin from the future. Well, not technically the future now because you're
listening to me downloaded on demand in your podcast player. But that's besides the point.
Why am I here?
I'm here to include another shoutout.
After our recorded conversation, Laker, a devoted Hemispherian and Discord participant,
has joined One Prime Plus.
We want to acknowledge Laker for joining the One Prime Plus clan.
Thank you, and back to the show.
I think this is pretty old news at this point, and I don't even know if this is on anyone's
radar, really.
And I'm not a spot is about Spotify.
So disclaimer, I don't have Spotify, but it's it's related to it.
So there was this, I believe it started as a tweet from a deal.
Is that how you say that a deal?
Is that what the kids call this one?
I think it's Adelaide Adelaide.
Okay.
Love it.
Anyway, apparently Spotify had a thing where you could shuffle albums, which seems pretty
I feel like that's been a thing in computer music playback forever.
I had a 60s stacker that could do that.
Pioneer system.
There you go.
So even as old as Andrew, this has been around.
But I guess she was upset that this was a feature,
because according to her, and I think other artists as well,
they created this thing in this precise way.
and it should never, ever be listened to, you know, in any other way than from
beginning to end the way they laid it out.
And apparently, I don't know if it was directly because of that or what, then Spotify
got rid of the feature because of this.
Well, it moved it down a layer like Apple Music already had.
Yeah. I don't care about Spotify or it just, the whole thing felt like, this is
dumb. Like, really?
Why do you get to dictate how I listen to your music?
Especially when things like music now are so song-based anyway.
It's like on the radio, they don't play your whole album end to end.
They play a song that's popular today and hopefully they'll play it next week too.
I don't know. I just the whole thing felt like, what?
What is happening here? And maybe I'm maybe I'm overthinking this.
I have a philosophy.
Well, maybe not a philosophy, but a thought.
It depends on whether you consider an album to be like a novel or a series of short stories.
Okay.
So is an album a complete thing that you would read as a book from page one to page last?
Or is it an anthology of stories that you can just dip in on, read one, read the other one?
Doesn't matter there.
I guess she's taking the view that this is a complete piece of work that you should build some mood through an album from track one to track
whatever 10 and you need to listen to in that order so you shouldn't shuffle by
shuffling it you're undermining the entire story okay Martin when I looked
at some of the articles that have been put up about what a Dell request and
what Spotify ended up doing the way that I saw it reported in a number of
articles was that Spotify removed the default option of shuffle which leads
you to think oh well the default action the default option was shuffled order
which is not the case, it was just the button.
And they didn't remove the button entirely,
they just moved it down a level of the UI,
kind of like what Apple already has
when you click that little hamburger list button, right?
That's my understanding.
And if anyone out there is listening
and wants to correct me, go for it, but that's what I found.
So it's actually more of a design decision
rather than removing the feature entirely,
it's just somewhat hidden.
And I agree with Andrew
that if you wanna listen to an album,
it's probably best to listen to it in order
because whether it was done with a flowing story
as a concept album or a beginning, middle, end,
or if it was just a bit of a mix anyway,
because that's just the order they liked,
I think it's good to start from beginning to end.
And a good example, I think,
I'm quite a fan of the Muse album, "Drones."
I don't know if you two have listened to that,
but there's actually a flowing story through the songs
where this person becomes kind of weaponized
as part of this drone theme within Muse's war story.
And then it has this big crescendo,
almost like a big dystopian musical at the end
that rounds out the story.
So if you were to listen to that the first time out of order, it would make absolutely no sense
and the actual concepts would be thrown out of whack. Following that if you go "oh I like number
three better than number one" and you want to flip it around that's cool. But I'm not super
bothered by Spotify making a different design decision and if it makes people happy then
that's totally fine. I think what I find funny in terms of Adele's request though is that we talk
about listening to an album in order, and I feel like I'm going to contradict myself now,
we talk about listening to an album in order as if it's the natural state of affairs, as if albums
have always existed, when really it's just a capitalist invention, because that's how music
used to be marketed, and it's kind of holding on in this shuffle era. So if Adele puts effort into
making a story, and she wants you to listen to it in order, fair enough, we should try listening to
that story, but I don't think we should pretend that the medium was always this way and that
it should stay that way and static for the rest of eternity if there's a better or a
different way to do it or we have a technological affordance that means it can be enjoyed differently.
So I think everyone's kind of right, but we shouldn't be slamming people if they want
to listen to something differently.
Not so much a New Year's resolution, but just because I have some more time at the moment,
on holiday, I wanted to engage in a digital cleanup. And I'm not just talking about files
clogging up my computer or folders that are messy. I actually mean physical media and drives that
have digital crap everywhere. I mean, we're obviously kind of different ages. When I was
a kid in the noughties, I'll put it that way. I was into computers, but obviously storage was much
much more expensive and you had much less space.
So I was sharing a family computer,
I eventually got my own laptop,
but because I was into making movies
and taking lots of photos,
I was kind of the family photographer or historian.
I quickly hit the limits of my digital media constantly
and was forced to within bounds
and trying to do time machine backups
and keep copies of things,
having to offload to drives to the point
that I started to think that I'd lost things recently.
And so I've been doing this huge cleanup
and trying to consolidate all of this stuff
from all of these different drives.
And in the process, I've been relieved time and time again
to find that I never actually lost things.
So it's been like the most wonderful start to the new year
going, oh my goodness, I didn't lose photos from this trip.
Oh my goodness, I didn't lose this home video.
This is fantastic.
Just put in the newer Mac mini and back up this stuff.
So that's been a great start for me.
And it's now actually making a bit of space
so I can recycle these drives.
Have either of you two ever engaged in that kind of digital cleanup or do you have problems to deal with?
Maybe starting with you, Andrew.
Well, I like the fact that you refer back to being in the noughties when hard drives were expensive.
I can see.
I know it was worse before.
I can still remember being a youngster with my Amiga 500 and lusting after, some people might get this reference, the GVP 52 megabyte hard drive.
Wow.
And it was slotted into the side.
52 megabytes.
I think it was actually like 50, but the 52 was kind of like the formatting headspace.
It was the 1024 base 10 count.
I don't know.
It cost about a thousand bucks, mate.
50 megabytes.
Wow.
It was incredible.
The basic Amiga Commodore one didn't fit neatly with the profile of the Amiga 500, and it
was only a 40 megabyte hard drive.
The GVP was svelte and had an extra 10 megabytes.
I know the pain of storage and trying to figure it all out
moving to the more current time I
Actually find myself. I don't have lots of hard drives stacked around anymore. I have one
Thunder Bay drive array, but even that is not heavily used it has photo backup
It has some media files. I don't actually create a lot of digital content anymore
And I look around I don't have much stuff and everything I have is usually on some.
Sinking platform somewhere anyway so it kind of ends up being everywhere it's almost a problem that I don't have anymore.
Is that because you dealt with it already or you were never creating a lot of stuff in the first place.
I think I'm actually a neat kind of person so I love the delete button I'll delete things.
I don't keep everything I ever produced which maybe a blessing or a curse depending on how you look at it so I don't have a huge backlog of stuff from my past.
Maybe it's just different different habits or something because I have all of this stuff from as I said when I was a teenager and I was kind of the unofficial amateur videographer for Jody's soccer team for years and I used to do endless disk image burning for every kid on the team and kept things in the fear that.
Someone would say oh little Johnny didn't get something.
So would you keep the source files or would you just keep the end product.
I kept everything.
Yeah I would delete everything except the end product I'll be like right well I've mastered it I'm never gonna go back to that source material again.
Delete Jason's got like terabytes and terabytes of storage in his house I think.
He was nodding big time.
I like keeping everything I have major regrets from from my early early first computer days.
of projects that I would do, little like stop motion movies and stuff.
And because storage was just, it was very finite,
it was either on the hard drive, which was maybe, I don't know, back then it would have been
maybe hundreds of megabytes, I guess, for a large one. Other than that,
it was your floppies that held a megabyte. And for whatever reason,
reason that stuff is lost to time,
which I think about all the time,
how much I would love to have all of those little stop motion movies and just
dumb crap that really has no effect on anyone,
but it just would be so fun to go back and see those.
Like I'm sure the images were probably like three 20 by two 40 from just this,
you know, really crappy first generation webcam.
but a lot of that stuff I don't have anymore.
And then I lost a ton of stuff on my original blog because of that.
I think that was from like 90, I don't even remember the dates now.
It's on my blog now. It says with a little sad face with a tear. Um,
but after that it was pretty much like,
I am never going to lose anything again no matter what.
I don't care what it takes. I will not lose stuff anymore.
So now for a while I went through having, you know,
bunches of bigger and bigger, progressively larger hard drives.
Now I just have a giant array.
I think it's 26 terabytes or something like that, which is insane
to even think about now thinking back to those one megabyte floppy disks.
But I think it's 26 terabytes and it's probably half full roughly.
Wow.
So almost a terabyte of photos is on there and videos too.
And then that's all backed up to like Backblaze as well. So they love that.
But yeah, I keep everything raw materials, every single iteration, you know,
there'll be, if it's a thing I'm working on, it'll be V one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, all of them. Wow. Just in case.
Way more than what I'm dealing with.
Yeah. I just, you know, most of it, if this,
If this 24 terabytes, you know, poofed into the ether,
would it be the end of the world?
Not really, but just knowing that I have it,
I think it's like a comfort thing at this point,
knowing that I just don't wanna ever be in that position
where, shoot, where is that thing
that I completely promised the world
I would never need again, and here I am wishing I had it.
So I keep everything.
Do you have stuff stored on DVDs still at all, or like data?
I do have those things floating around and often photos from relatives.
So, things that were given to me that I never got around to doing because it was tedious.
Those are the worst. Some of those early like CDRs that were real dodgy because they were expensive.
So, we bought the, you know, the hundred spindle for super cheap.
And now you pull them out of the drawer and it's just flaking off and you're just like, oh, no.
Yeah, it's bad. It's an archaeological kind of nightmare and delight at the same time to discover these things.
For a while I would do spindle backups and you'd have like little post-it notes stuck out the side of it to be like, I got up to that disc, I can go from this disc forward now.
It's just ridiculous kind of management.
That's fine to tagging pre-Mavericks, you were just post-it noting everything.
Post-it note.
[Music]
Media Corner.
It's time for Media Corner. We've just heard the fantastic theme.
We did.
By Mr Alex Canyon.
Followed by a hand clap.
Hopefully.
Yep. Done.
There's a clap there.
Thanks.
Editor says, thanks.
I bought this stream deck.
I'm determined to use it.
Have they made a new one of those by the way yet?
I don't think so.
Or is it still the same one?
I think it's the same one.
Okay.
I hardly use mine.
I forget that I have it.
Just sits in, it's a bit like a touch bar.
Just sits here and I forget that I have it.
I'm interested in one when they actually, whenever they rev it.
Yeah.
Cause I don't like the current one.
I don't like the way the buttons feel.
Bit squishy.
Yeah.
Feels like an ATM that too many people have used over too many years.
So is that Media Corner?
Yeah, it is. Actually, for any new listeners, for any new listeners in 2022, Media Corner is a segment where we make recommendations of different things we've been watching, reading, playing, anything that is technically a medium.
So it can be very broad.
That's just about everything.
And we also keep a craft note, actually, if you haven't seen it before.
We link it in the show notes.
It's linked on the website so you can see all previous recommendations and jump in.
Get to a philosophical question.
Media.
What is media?
Do you want to open that up with me?
Really?
That would be a disaster.
It's an album that you listen to from beginning to end without stopping.
Can you imagine Martin just being asked, Martin, please tell us what media is.
Don't. I can actually tell you very quickly what it is.
Strict time budget.
Strict time budget.
OK, here we go. I'll just tell you what it is.
Oh no, I'm sorry.
No, no, no. No, it's very, it's very quick.
within the field of media ecology that forms my own studies and research, a medium or media
is actually synonymous with technology. So basically anything in the world that is a
human made tool, from a television show through to an Apple Watch through to a table, even
light, they're all media because they extend or amputate, as Mr. Marshall McLuhan said,
anything that is a human capability. There you go.
So why do we have media corner segment? Our whole show is just media corner.
Because it's part of the branding.
Because we have assumed in the naming of the segment that we're talking about
news or entertainment media specifically. But that would be too cumbersome to say.
We need a jingle. Also branding.
Yeah, branding.
News and entertainment media corner.
So now that we've had academic corner within media corner, Jason, do you want to kick us off?
This is just corner now. Oh, I would love to. I've got one today.
And since we were talking about music,
I'm going to go with the music route and it's not going to be an album from
beginning to end. So, boom.
This is a little bit nostalgic for me.
And then I was doing a little bit of research. So I don't know. I, well,
I know Martin thoroughly researches any music that he ever hears.
So he knows like every where they were born, what they eat for breakfast,
all that stuff. I generally know nothing about any music that I listen to other than just hearing the music, right?
So, it's like, I wonder what's the, what's the story here?
So, my pick for the first Media Corner pick of 2020 V3 is Knife Party.
Wow.
Really?
Either of you heard of this?
No, I'm not.
Yes, I'm aware of Knife Party.
Yeah, you are.
I had to listen to it many times while my friends were drunk around me and I drank tea.
I love knife party. Knife party comes from actually pendulum, which is actually where I
knew them from previously. So they were pendulum and then they did like this offshoot thing knife
party. Where are they from? Good old Australia. Where? WA, Perth.
How do I? I probably know these guys.
They're probably your best friends. And I'm so mad you've not introduced me.
So this just came up on the iPod on the iPod. No, that's my lawn
on the home pod. The other pod that's in our house. Uh, it just was one of those
where I was playing from my library randomly and it came on. I was like, God,
it just, I just love everything they do. Wow. So I wanted to put it in as a pick
because I'm not sure anybody's really heard them or heard of them. And then as
I was doing this research and I was like, wait, Perth, really? Come on. Like,
what are the odds of that? So there you go. Pendulum is great. Knife Party is awesome.
They're very different. So if you're not into Knife Party, go check out Pendulum because it's
much more, I guess, sane would be a way to say it. But Knife Party is very, they're just like,
they go hard. They are, they're just great. Please go listen to them. Check out some of their stuff.
And if nothing else, they're from Perth, so you know their, you know, their personalities,
Obviously.
Yeah.
And to tack on a little recommendation that isn't mine, but links to yours, Jason, if we're talking about the same pendulum, they also did a fantastic and very popular remix of the ABC News theme from Australia.
Oh, I think I've heard that.
Did they really?
Yeah, we'll have to link that in the show notes.
That really did well in the clubs.
You know, people were dancing to classic newsreader theme.
So check that out.
There's a knife party song that even has a reference to Crocodile Dundee.
So there you go.
That's not a knife party.
This is a knife party.
We saw them live at, we went to a new year's thing a couple of years ago, a knife
party thing.
Uh, what do you call those concerts, I guess.
Oh yeah.
And Oh God, they just, they smash so hard.
It's, they're just great.
And it was around, I think it was around 2017, maybe 2018.
I don't know.
I can't remember now, but I'll put a picture in the show notes.
They're, they're great.
So, that is my pick for 2022 Knife Party.
Fantastic.
I like it.
Well, I don't know if I like it.
I'll give it to- listen, I'll tell you if I like it.
I'm going to just go ahead and tell you right now, Andrew, you don't like Knife Party.
Okay.
I can tell you that right now.
Okay.
You might be okay with Pendulum, kind of as a chill, relaxing kind of background music in the house,
where you're like, you know, doing chores or something.
But I can already guarantee you don't like Knife Party.
And we know Martin doesn't either. So, all right, put that out of the way.
There you go. Well, we'll have some follow up in the future, Andrew, if you like them or not.
Who's next? I don't know.
Yeah, I'll go next on this. Andrew, do you have a burning desire to be second?
No, I've got a burning desire to be third. He wants to be the closer.
Great. So, Natasha and I watched a movie the other night on SBS World Movies,
but I'm sure you can get this in other places if you're not from Australia.
We thought it looked interesting. The English title for this Icelandic movie
is less appealing to me than the original title.
The English title for this Icelandic film is?
Yes. So it's a movie called Virgin Mountain, but the original
title is Fusi, which is F U with a little acute and S I.
So hand clap.
Hand clap.
Definitely. Don't say Fusi too many times.
Hand clap that now.
Did I say something rude without knowing it?
No. You'll figure it out later.
Oh, damn it. Okay. Well, it's just the name of the guy who's the protagonist in the film. I'm sorry.
Anyway. The guy's name is Fusco?
Yes. It's an Icelandic name. Okay.
Okay. Go ahead.
At least Nordic. Anyway. So, you can kind of consider this as a very heartwarming, but also very soul crushing, Icelandic equivalent to the 40 year old virgin.
Wow. Okay.
What the hell just happened right now?
That is not anywhere near where I thought you were going with this.
Hence the name Virgin Mountain.
Sure.
What I want to make clear here is that if you enjoy The 40 Year Old Virgin, which is
a comedy with Steve Carell, for those who haven't seen it or don't know it's from what
2004 I think.
Anyway, that's a very over the top kind of silly, very funny movie.
This is actually, I would say, quite realistic.
It looks at a lot of issues like, and I'm sorry if this sets anyone off or triggers
anyone in the audience, but it deals with a lot of things like depression and loneliness
and a lot of heavy family themes. And it really follows this guy who I would say is probably the
nicest character I've seen in the history of cinema, at least all the movies I've ever seen.
And it kind of shows how people who are ridiculed by society are completely overlooked or not really
understood. This guy means well, great intentions. He's just incredibly reserved. And you kind of see
how despite being downtrodden repeatedly he's actually the nicest guy and goes above and
beyond to do things for other people, even people he's only just met. So if you're after
something that's funny, endearing, but also quite sad, it's only like an hour and a half
long. It has these wonderful moments of awkwardness and silence in it. I'd highly recommend Virgin
Mountain or the title in Icelandic that I'm apparently not supposed to be saying.
Okay. Does it have the soundtrack by Sigur Rós?
I didn't hear the minute which is interesting actually because normally they're shoehorned just about everything but you could play them in the background if you wanted I could just recommend some tracks get the right ambience.
Have you noticed we all mean Jason always seem to derail your media corner picks.
Yeah I haven't noticed that.
Okay and also have you.
That's okay I don't I don't hold it against you I just edit out boring bits from you afterwards.
I noticed.
No wonder I'm never on the damn show.
It's a it's a two man.
I'm always if you look at the timeline though I always have like the fewest actual bars spoken dialogue.
I do know that nothing about it.
I take no credit for that I'm not editing ever so that's on you.
I don't bring that up as a complaint I just I just before anyone thinks that I'm editing both of you out excuse me.
Look man if you just say something interesting from time to time we might include you.
He's gone.
Wow, we got one show into the year and that was it.
I made a joke last show that it was the last show ever.
I think it's actually this one.
I just thought I'd move away from the microphone to give you some more air time.
Okay, I've got maybe a corner.
I've got a statement and then a selection.
Okay, statement.
I finished a book and realized that I had to log the fact that I finished the book on about 12 different book reading sites
And it made me angry. So if this is the most Andrew thing I've heard in the history
the the state protocol of
W-a is that upon reading a book you must log it in 12 different library locations
I'm serious took me longer to log the book than to have
Did to read it I I had to go to who's forcing you to do that. That's terrible of them
Just think about it. There's good reads. There's micro blog epilogue thing. There's literal. There's
The story graph never heard of it
I think there might be another one probably and I don't know which one is the good one, right?
So I'm just using it doing it everywhere. It's ridiculous. I need a solution. Can I propose a solution? Sure
Read the book and then be done. Well, I would do that normally now this thing's another thing. I've got an
I've read a book about six or seven years ago, and I cannot place what it was. I asked my mother-
So you've heard the big red dog.
I asked my mother-in-law who bought me the book what the book what it was.
She doesn't even remember giving it to me, and I can't find any trace of it anywhere. I've done random Googles. I can't find it.
It's annoying the crap is out of me.
It's a book sort of a somewhat fantasy, but like real world, but with some fantasy elements. A woman,
she's in a difficult sort of situation,
and she has this dream of going to the islands of Dalmatia.
She meets somebody and has conversations
around a fountain in the town square.
If anybody can please tell me what that book was,
I'd really appreciate it.
Okay, my media corner pick.
It's a board game, it's called King of Tokyo.
- Yes.
- I have been playing it.
Well, we've had it for a long time.
Benji yesterday said,
"Can we play that game with the dinosaurs in it and the monsters?"
I'm like, "What are you talking about?"
And then we found that he found it, he pointed it out in the cupboard.
And he remembered it from the one time we tried to play it about six months ago.
Amazing memory for a six-year-old.
He is now obsessed with King of Tokyo,
which means I've had to become obsessed with King of Tokyo
over the last 24 to 36 hours.
It is a fun game.
We had to play it this morning before this very podcast.
I think he's probably playing it now outside.
He's been watching YouTube videos of other people playing King of Tokyo.
Wow.
Now, the one thing I'm worried about is the game says it's
recommended for ages eight plus.
So he is breaking the law, but he's grasped it pretty well.
I've gotten the hang of it.
I really enjoy it.
King of Tokyo board game.
The good thing is one of my sort of like new years, one of the things I
wanted to do this year was play more.
Active games like that physical games.
And so this the fact that he pointed this out to play it has been perfect so I want I'm enjoying this one and I want to find more games like it.
Boy do I have the game for you.
Okay.
No I'm kidding.
I was I was gonna shamelessly self promote.
Oh you're yes yeah coffee pot games.
Two things so last episode you entered your older child into the life of crime by signing them up for a windows account that they were not old enough for.
Yes.
Now you've entered your younger child into a life of crime by playing this board game out of the age range gotta say you're really.
Really leading them down a path here look the next step is just buying drugs off the street when you become a parent they don't give you a guidebook they give you a purple book from the from the Department of Health.
Reminding you how to give them vaccinations and stuff but there's no parenting advice in there.
The other day we went to a place that has a whole bunch of old video games.
I was just curious, I was looking at it and thinking,
were you guys ever into the coin ops? And do you still go now? Do you still play them?
This place is kind of fun. It serves the most delicious pizza. I should, I get Palace Arcade.
Oh yeah, sponsored by Palace Arcade.
Okay, really good. Good food. Everything is simplified now. You don't actually have coins.
You just have the swipe card, but it's not like it's not like the modern if you go to an actual commercial.
Games place these days. They're all the ticket.
Yeah, it's like when a price win those tickets get prizes.
Yes, some junk.
This isn't this is more pure.
This is just we've got old coin up games from the 80s or 90s or whenever they are and you play them and that's it.
Yep. Well, my answer is going to be quick because I know that Jason has more fun things to say.
Yeah. I'm not really into these places. I'm not against them, but I didn't really grow up with them.
Natasha's big on time zone. So in inverted commas, the junk that you were just talking about,
she'll have something to say about that. She loves it.
There goes another listener. Yep. There you go.
There's another place in Wollongong called Be Lucky and Sons, which is another ticket riff on that whole thing.
but it's not really my thing. Jason, your fun answer?
There is a great place in the US called Round One. Their symbol is like a bowling pin. So,
they have like bowling alleys, but they have massive amounts of arcade games. Same thing,
slide the card kind of deal. They are the best, most fun arcades. We had one where we used to
live when we were in California, pretty close to us, so we'd go to pretty regularly. So much fun.
We haven't been to one in many years, obviously now, given the times.
But once, uh, should we ever get out of any of this, we will definitely
be going back to around one.
And I remember when I was a pre teen slash teenager, maybe probably.
15 ish, something like that.
There was a place called the nickel arcade, which was same thing where we
actually used coins, but everything was nickels.
That's a nickel as 10 cents.
- Five cents. - Five cents, okay.
- Yeah, so everything was one nickel in the beginning,
and then they were like, wait a minute,
we could keep it, the nickel arcade,
but each machine could take multiple nickels per game.
It was like, oh, damn it.
So you'd show up with pockets full of nickels
as a kid after school and just blow them all
playing old/new arcade games,
and it's just so much fun to just go
with three or four friends and blow through.
The new arcades though, like the round one
where you can get adult beverages and food and stuff
is like, that's pretty fun.
- Yeah, this is what this was.
It's like, you can have a beer.
Yeah, beer, pizza, food.
I just wanna say real credit to myself.
We went and I didn't play a single game of NBA Jam.
- What?
- Usually, I know that's usually where all my money goes,
but I think 'cause Benji was obsessed.
We basically gave all our credits to Benji and he was--
How are you going to be on fire?
I know.
He's heating up.
Is it the shoes?
I'm disappointed.
I know.
I know.
Anyway, he played, he was obsessed with the Simpsons game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
game.
Oh, the one with the three screens?
No, just the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
No, it's just a single screen.
And you just, it's just a side scroller and you each got attack, attacking.
I'm sorry.
I misspoke.
That was X-Men.
That was three screens.
Please don't correct me.
get to that one though and Daytona was the other big hit of the day.
Oh yes.
Why is the steering always so bad on those things?
Because a bunch of five-year-old kids are just racking them.
Whenever I did play something like that I just thought why is this so deliberately rubbish?
I always want to know why the seats never go back far enough.
Oh because they're meant for seven-year-olds not for you.
Yeah the Mario Kart one is great I love that one where you're actually in a little car
It's fantastic. Yeah, that's a bit different. I think that's a bit more fun and destructive. There you go
So they get so let us know what your favorite coin op arcade game is
I also like pinball games as well pinball games count. Yeah, let us know what you like
Because I also want some suggestions. These things must be harder to come by but they need new content
You know, that's the only problem with these places is they don't have new games to roll in
You know, they're just dealing with what's available on the secondhand market or wherever they get them from
With the exception of one thing which I think is garbage where they just take basically iPhone games and make them all that nice not that's just rubbish don't do that just just stop.
I don't know with angry birds I think I've seen that.
Angry birds fruit ninja the list goes on.
I don't mind I wouldn't mind a new a new game but it has to be built as a coin up game.
Can I throw out a question you get one arcade cabinet the full thing.
In your home what do you pick can I opt out and say nothing.
Sure it's NBA Jam no I can't think I'll try to actually think of an answer to your original NBA Jam.
Okay.
Martin is nothing.
I'm thinking about how much it would annoy me to take up space and I have to bust it.
We'll give Martin the Daytona system with the steering wheel that's real bad.
Actually, no, that'd be good and then I could actually try to master it and then stop complaining about it.
So I'll take that. That's probably the biggest one.
We'll only give him one seat as well.
So the whole joy of the game is lost on him.
Like, no, you can't play with somebody else.
He can't even play multiplayer.
Yeah, perfect.
Thank you.
He does like driving it.
You're a rally.
What about your rally get you like the rally ones?
What's the rally?
But I don't like I don't like racing games that aren't built as realistic simulators.
Oh yeah yeah yeah I get you.
And look and most people listening now probably hate me but I'm actually not a fan of things like Mario Kart.
I find it annoying that I skid out of control after driving well because someone lobbed a banana at me.
I really don't like that.
Yeah I would blue shell the hell out of you.
Yeah and I just go thanks I was trying to drive well and you've ruined it.
Thanks.
You can always there's always a chance you get the bullet.
True.
But I know but I want to drive I don't want to think about this person's in third and I want to overtake them by putting oil slick everywhere or something just I just want to drive.
Show title I just want to drive I just want to drive just let me drive mine would be golden tea what's that.
The golf game the ball where you do the ball to like make the to do the swing you have to like go back for the backswing and then go forward or you could like.
Spin it that's not what that's not where you stand in it actually do swing a golf no no it's just a regular arcade cabinet with a big the only control is just one big ball that you use as your swing it's great.
I don't think I'm saying that.
I guarantee and you give you like a beer to half you would be you would never want to leave you be there all night that's arcade corner.
Perfect. Do you think people like that there are corners that only happen once? Well they're nooks. We've been through this.
And talking about corners, the best place or the best corner for people to chat if you're not already part of it is the official Hemispheric Views Discord.
That's the best corner to discuss all corners and there's actually an official media corner chat in that overall corner. So check it out if you aren't already there.
Recently, we had, it wasn't quite breakfast, it was more of a brunch, but it was very breakfasty
at Natasha's grandparents' place. And what really stood out to me as usual, but even more so than
usual, was that the food that was served, there were breakfast items, right? There was kind of
the bacon and egg thing, there was toast and so on. But there were also other things, and I think
I messaged you both about this on the day, on New Year's Day. Cornflakes?
Well, I'm talking about there were things like chicken souvlaki, like a lunch or dinner item for breakfast and then shapes chicken crimpies as snack food.
Right.
So we're talking about shapes.
So the best shape is a chicken crimpy.
I think that was voted the best, at least in the last year, alongside barbecue and pizza.
Which I have not had yet.
Still very upset.
And they are, in fact, crimped.
I want to do a comparison of the chicken crimpies and the chicken in a basket.
It's not a contest crimpies. I want to do a contest but well you can still compare you can have a look
But what I thought about in the process of this was
Why do we hold on to such traditions or norms about which food you should eat at which time of the day right because I know
Sometimes I think oh, it's nighttime. I have a craving for some cereal. I'm gonna have some cereal other times
It's you know, it's breakfast time
I might have a pickle with my veggie mind and people probably think why the hell would you have a pickle at this time or?
or with Vegemite. So, is it so strange that we introduce things that are from other meal times
into a different meal time? What do you two both do? Do you have odd habits where you eat
the wrong thing at the wrong time? I feel like this is a country-specific thing,
and I feel like the US is probably one of the worst offenders of the very deliberate,
"These are breakfast, lunch, and dinner foods." If I think about traveling to various other
countries, it seems like those barriers break down a lot more thinking.
The first thing that comes to my mind is going to Japan.
Anytime I go there, I can eat the same food for all three meals every day.
And it's fine.
There's no issue with that.
If I want to have sushi at 6:00 AM, do it.
Doesn't matter.
Like it's whatever, do what you're going to do.
Even if you look at something where you go, you know, various
hotels will be more or less Americanized, I guess I would say, depending on where you're going.
But even if you look at something that's like your kind of spread of breakfast items,
have a piece of fish for breakfast. Do whatever you want. Like, it doesn't matter.
I find the whole delineation of breakfast, lunch, and dinner to be pretty dumb, actually. It should
just be kind of, it's eat food. The time of day doesn't matter. It's just eat food. I don't
understand why it has to be, you can only have pancakes for breakfast. Oh, sorry, breakfast
hours are over. Now it's lunchtime. It's like, make a damn pancake for lunch. Why does it matter?
For example, bacon and egg rolls, okay? You have that at breakfast time. But bacon on a hamburger,
people think, okay, well, that's a lunch or a takeaway dinner food. You wouldn't have a hamburger
Breakfast so I think it's ridiculous to who decided that bacon at some time is good on something and not on another.
I think the only issue is the time of day will dictate the type of food only in such a way that.
The very first meal of the day you probably don't want to eat like a half of a lasagna because you're probably gonna be pretty sleepy for the rest of the day.
I would do it but it would be probably a pretty big mistake given that the rest of your day is pretty ruined because now you've just eaten a bunch of like heavy food so I understand that portion but still there's.
There's light medium and heavy foods that can be divvied up throughout the day.
So you would agree that that time that I had KFC leftovers for breakfast was a mistake.
Depends on what the day was. What did you have for the rest of the day? What was going on?
Did you have any?
I think out of pure guilt it was just healthy but not only was it the wrong time of day at least in this case
But it lost whatever crispiness that it did have. It does not have that crispiness. Oh, you don't want it
Yeah, you know what? That was a breakfast sog fest. That's what it was.
Yeah, that's just an implementation issue though. That has nothing to do with with a breakfast lunch or dinner
It should just be called food one food two food three
Done and then decimal points for each intervening meal or snack. Yeah, like breakfast 1.1. You're like I'm still hungry
I'm gonna have a snack 1.1 snack. Okay, good. Let's just get rid of the words all together. No, it's a 1 2 or 3
Intermittent snacks are like a 1.1 and 1.2
I like this, but I've been ruined because we have kids now and so I feel like we've got an edgy
Yeah, I feel like we sort of have this responsibility. Maybe that's the time convert them convert them now
I remember seeing on breakfast television a few years ago there was there was this guy who was trying to challenge.
Exactly what you're talking about and saying hey ice cream earlier in the day is technically better for you because you can burn it off and you don't having it late at night when you're going to be.
Sedentary so I'm not saying that's necessarily what people should do.
She making me rethink your making me rethink my entire life at this point.
Ice cream should be more of like a 1.2 or 1.3 versus like a 3.5.
I have felt less guilty having a dessert pancake with ice cream for breakfast because I know that for the rest of the day I'm going to be doing fitness or up and moving I'm not going to be going well it's 830pm dessert time let me just sink into the lounge cushions and gag for the rest of the evening.
I think we just solved like a really big world issue right now.
I'm actually really taken by this idea cooking big dinners every night such a.
It's not what you want to be doing at that time of day. I'm much more open to cooking something interesting in the middle of the day.
I think I'm moving to the decimal system from now on. Moving to the food decimal system.
I also want pancakes now.
Yeah, I could eat some pancakes now for sure.
Perfect.
Maple syrup.
Where do you stand with fruit on pancakes?
Depends on the fruit.
So waffle I think is more accommodating to fruit I feel than a pancake because got those little holes that you can kind of put fruit in.
Can you you in America you would use the spray on cream right spray isn't that what you do in America.
You the team to be the whipped cream can whipped cream that can and the tin and you.
Oh gross no pancakes.
Jodie loves eating that straight out of the spray bit.
No don't put that on my waffles.
Just shame Jodie there.
No no no no I'm not IHOP give me a break.
I do agree with Jason's waffle approach particularly for blueberries you can actually give each blueberry a little house.
You know so they don't fly across the play can I tell you what I do is I take two waffles and I cut one diagonally.
And then I put it on like a roof on the other one that's a square so you have a little house made of waffles and then you make the windows in the doors out of blueberries.
Real quick though I just realized another problem we solved with the decimal food system because it doesn't matter what happens at each point we've solved for food time zones.
Because now it doesn't matter my 1.1 is the same as your 1.1 it's all the same so we could have a share we don't have to think like.
My dinner is during your breakfast no we can all eat a meal together because we're all whatever time of day it is like a 3.1 you guys want to grab a bite let's do it.
I like that there's a lot of problems in the world and that was one of them it just got some we could all go to a restaurant pop open a FaceTime group chat and all be eating at 3.1 separately but together.
I think we need to get this straight because a catchy name is what's needed to make this go international and I'm going to propose that we call this the decimal system.
It's done it's already done get the domain shut it down I'm getting the domain right now.
Going to pork bun dot com.
I mean pork bun that's a 1.0 2.0 3.0 that eat a pork bun any time of day.
Pork bun is like the best they hit all the right buttons for me and they're right down the street.
You think I could go register a domain in person.
Knock on the front door.
Hi.
I'd like to register decimal.com please.
All right let's see is there like a dot meal because that would be really handy.
With the decimal point in it.
Yes, that's what I'm thinking. That would be oh, that's a meal calm
had to cart
Actually getting
