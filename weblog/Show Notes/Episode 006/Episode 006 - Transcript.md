That's a good idea, yeah, because it's self-evident. You can see
we've provided photos of each of our respective desks.
I have questions about both of yours.
It's not very interesting for us to just repeat what you can see.
The interest comes from the questions that others ask. So yes, perfect.
I'm going to start with Martin's first.
Yeah.
Because his, his, his had a few things that I had questions about.
Oh, go for it.
Question. No, not really.
Well, yeah, questions and maybe comments.
Be direct.
The first thing I have to know, obviously, is underneath your monitor,
there's like a bar or something.
Are you talking about the stand?
That it's on a little puck thing.
It looks like a miniature soundbar.
Yeah, it looks like a little soundbar thing.
It's like about.
You mean the silver thing?
Yeah, no, that's just a stupid design point that Samsung included on the monitor
So they you know how they like to make things glary and garish. They just decided to make that part silver. Oh
That's part of the monitor stand. I thought it was like some super cool little speaker
Me too
No, that's Samsung seducing you to buy the monitor. So you think it's a soundbar? Okay. Good question answered
Um, I love the mouse pad.
I think the mouse pad is great.
It's your logo.
Thank you for lounge ruminator.
Love it.
That's right.
Natasha made it for me.
If that makes it any better.
Kudos to her.
Thank you.
It does.
It absolutely does.
Uh, millennium Falcon on the left.
Obviously that makes sense.
Next question.
The blinds are shut just enough to where I cannot see outside and it makes me wonder
Was it a lighting decision? A. B. There's some horrific thing out the window that you
don't want anyone to see. Or you just thought it looked nice having them at a 45 degree
angle.
It's where he doesn't want you to see the bodies. Have you ever heard of Snowtown? The
Snowtown murders?
No. Is that close to him? Because now I'm concerned.
To answer your question, Jason, I am not ashamed of what is out my window. In fact, I really
enjoy the view out my window. There are trees and I can see more of the escarpment in the distance.
I only turned them because it was a lighting decision and I thought I'm going to forget to
submit it. It has to be now. The sun was really glaring and reflecting off the window of the
house next door and I went I got to do it this way and then that's when your other part of the
question comes into play. That precise angle was an aesthetic decision so that one could see that
light was coming through in an attractive sense. So I hope that's a satisfactory answer. Okay yep
love it I have two more questions because first of all please this is gonna
be really controversial already I can tell what's up with your doc go on that's
pretty much it what why why is it over there on the right and it is that even
the dock? I don't think that's even the dock. That's like some some bolted on fake dock.
Now see this was the setup to get you to ask about this. It is not the dock, it is Switchglass.
Ah okay. Yep yep. Which is John Syracuse's app switching application and the way that I set it
up to deliberately confuse people was that I turned on some of the apps that appear in my hidden bottom
dock but activated the hiding feature with command H so that you could still see the
desktop wallpaper. So that is not how I generally use my computer. It was purely for aesthetic
purposes and to cause some mild controversy on the episode. I am horrified. Thank you, though.
So that's not what anything ever looks like. You do see that on the right, like right now I can see
Audio Hijack, Discord, Finder, Skype, etc. And the dock is hidden because I find that it's a bit too
distracting with all the icons but yeah what you're seeing there is not the
normal view. Okay - sorry I lied two more questions now before it was three more
now it's two more. Please. Tell everyone what the wallpaper is and where they can
get it because I think people like wallpaper things and then do you always
have the icons on your desktop hidden or are there no icons on the desktop ever?
There are no icons on the desktop unless I'm working on something so at the end
each day I try to clear off whatever was there because it annoys me if things are hanging around.
Sometimes things will persist but I generally try to keep things clean for the next day. And the
wallpaper which I'm happy to share even though I didn't make it and maybe that's a copyright issue
who knows. It's a picture of a viper chasing a Cylon Raider from the show Battlestar Galactica
but as far as I'm aware it's a piece of fan art. And just to be clear for the nerds out there who
are fans of that show, it's the reimagined 2003 Battlestar Galactica, not the original from the
70s. Andrew, would you like to chastise Martin on anything in his?
Absolutely, absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. Just going on with the icons there. I feel like
I'm challenging now. This is not questions, I'm just challenging. I feel like I'm in a court.
About cross-examining the witness, please. Please do, yeah.
Do you not display your drive icons? I can understand icons like document icons being cleared away
I'm the same get rid of that junk but
Your drive icon don't you lose utility not having that able to be accessed
That's a good question because I was used to that because I grew up with
like things from the 90s like classic mac stuff, so I was certainly used to that but
Things like macintosh hard drive or hd or renamed otherwise
yes I normally hide now. If there is a volume that I would amount or something externally it
would appear there. I don't hide everything but I typically try to avoid clutter. But see this
is another effect of having to use switch class. Well not having to, choosing to. Switch class,
unless you have it auto hiding, will persist as an overlay over icons if you leave them there,
which then means that your icons are obscured. Now see that is purely a consequence of me wanting to
to put it on the right-hand side and not wanting to hide it.
And I really love this app.
It's changed the way that I generally compute and switch
between things.
But some of the aesthetic choices
you see in keeping it totally minimalist
are encouraged by the use of that application.
OK, thank you.
I'll move on to my next question.
You seem to have what appear to be speakers,
but they also appear to be miniature mirrors.
I feel like I'm driving a car and I've got rear vision mirrors on either side.
Do you feel that way when you're typing?
Uh, no, I had never, I had seen that they reflect what's behind me, but I've
never been bothered or felt like I'm in a car.
No.
Okay.
Cause sometimes things can, things may be closer than what they appear.
Oh God.
One last little question.
This is much more innocuous.
What's that little black box under at the back of your desk underneath your monitor shelf?
Just dank just not quite falling off the edge at the back
It looks like it really wants to come down doesn't it like one little thing is just it's gone. Is it blue tech?
You're very perceptive. Yes, it's blue tech. Well done
It's part of the Logitech speaker thing here, so it's actually where I plug in my headphones
Like I am right now to do this podcasting stuff. So pretty much everything you see here
All of this stuff that's tacked on together is the result of me having this
2014 Mac Mini from a time when I had no money to buy another computer. I got it as a refurb
so everything you see here from the monitor stand to the
Speakers to the choice of display to the webcam all of it is this
2005
Most affordable Mac ever Steve Jobs vision for piecing together
What could be an all-in-one machine for someone who might have had more money back in the day?
I love and hate how wonderfully clean
Your whole thing is it's just like everything is there for a reason you don't have a bunch of crap everywhere and
Speaking of myself
It just looks nice. Thank you. I appreciate that after being
Interrogated that is a positive conclusion. Don't worry Andrews next so I've got plenty of questions for him as well
Anything else for Martin Andrew before I it's a keychron keyboard, isn't it that you have there? Yes, it's the k1
It's the 87 key layout with the RGB. Although I think now they've actually changed the newer models have that curved
Dippy key. I'm not sure the technical terms, but these are flat keys. Okay mechanical keyboard with the flat top
I really love it. They're the really loud blue
So they're really loud.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You may step down.
