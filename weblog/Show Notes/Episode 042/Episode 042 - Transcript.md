Following on from our excellent guest,
Fortnardigo, we have another excellent guest.
Today we are joined by somebody who you probably don't know around the internet,
but many people will secretly rely on and not be aware of that.
We hear hemisphere views a big supporters of fastmail. I'm a happy customer Jason the happy customer Martin
We'll get him over the line at some point, but very happy to listen big supporter
He's mr. Default so you know dark cloud all the way, but what I'm saying here is we have somebody from fastmail themselves
His name is Rob and Rob joining us on the line welcome to hemispheric views. Thanks for coming. Hello. Thanks for having me
It is good to be here.
And I, Martin, I look forward to hearing all about the things
that you love about your current mail provider
so we can switch you over,
but sorry, I shouldn't start with the sales pitch
too quickly, right?
Yeah, thanks for having me.
- So, Rob, I mean, I guess I say fast mail,
but fast mail is probably a relatively sizable beast
with different people in different areas.
Where, what area of fast mail are you involved in?
- So I am the senior sys admin.
I sit within what we call our platform team.
So we look after the physical hardware, the networks,
the operating systems, and share things like databases
and storage and that sort of thing,
and all the stuff that the FastMail application,
the product sits on top of.
So yeah, so I spend my days here wondering about,
is our network running smoothly?
Do we have enough storage capacity for all your email?
Those kinds of things.
So I work within a team of about,
what are we, I think we're five people now,
and that's our job, that sort of stuff.
And it's really interesting.
- And I should clarify for people that aren't listening,
sorry, Fastmail is, it's an email provider,
but it also does the other things
that you would typically associate with email,
calendaring, notes, a bit of file storage.
Is that the pitch?
How do you present yourselves,
given that you're up against the likes of iCloud,
Microsoft, Gmail, probably the big ones.
- The best email provider on the planet,
I think is the tagline.
- I mean, we used to say,
email calendar contacts done right.
And the pitch is that email is obviously very important.
It's like one of the,
perhaps the last sort of open access internet services.
You know, there's no walled garden in theory.
Anyone can set up their own email service
and they'll all talk to each other.
And really communication between businesses
and sort of home users and everything
runs on the back of email.
And email is something you should care about.
And so we try to kind of sell a boutique service
a little bit, something that tries to balance
speed and privacy and all the add-on services you'd kind of expect, but also give you some
power user features if you need that stuff, give you personal support. So in some ways,
we don't really consider ourselves competitors to things like Gmail and Outlook and whatever else.
Obviously, there's similar services there, but the way they kind of interact with their market,
I suppose, and structure their products is sort of built in a different way. The very simple one is
We don't do advertising.
We don't have a free tier.
So for me, I've had fast mail for a bunch of years and I've, it's email, right?
It's, it's probably the one service that we've all had for the majority of our life.
You know, instant messaging services have come and gone, different kinds of social
media stuff has come and gone.
But email has kind of been there since the beginning, if you've been on computers, at
least, you know, if you're a nerd like any of us.
And I think we've all gone through, you know, when Gmail first came out and it was
People were buying email address,
or no, what was it, invite codes on eBay,
so you could get a Gmail account
and you could be one of the few
that had your special name at Gmail.
But that's the nice thing about email
is you just keep pushing it to the next service
and that's okay.
I finally found Fastmail a number of years ago
and it was like, "Okay, I pay for it.
Great, no worries there.
They're not gonna put a bunch of crap in there, perfect.
It's all just standards based so I can use whatever I want.
Whereas with things like Gmail, it's like,
yeah, it does cool stuff if you use their apps
and if you use their web client.
Well, I don't wanna do that.
Well, you lose all the good features.
Well, that sucks.
Whereas Fastmail is just like, here's all the stuff.
It's all based on standards.
It's great.
I appreciate that.
And I think it's hard for people to get excited
about email too, which has to be probably
somewhat tough for you guys.
I'll start by saying thank you for being a customer
and that's a much better sales pitch than mine.
I mean, there's always gonna be a lot of people
for whom email isn't important for, for whatever reason.
Yeah, and I mean, Gmail is a good product if it suits you.
But I think for us, it's kind of like we understand
that there are enough people out there
who care about their email,
who don't wanna spend too much time in their email.
Email's not the thing that you do.
Email's the thing you do for running your business
or talking to your friends or whatever.
You wanna get in, you wanna do the job, you wanna get out.
We understand that people are willing to pay for that.
a time saver. And since we know all of our customers are paying and care about their email,
we can sort of focus on those use cases a little bit better. So it tends not to be a difficult sell
for the people that understand what it is and why it's important. And then after that, the rest
comes out of sort of growing that pie, I suppose, comes out of telling people, "Well, here's why
email should be important for you." Like email is where all your reset codes come to.
You know, the security of your bank and everything else is important for that.
Email is something that you will never be locked into.
You never have to worry about, you know, what if that service that I chat to my friends
dies?
It's like, well, email won't do that.
And if you don't like our service, we encourage you to take it elsewhere.
Can I ask a question about the standards-based element of it you talk about?
Yeah, yeah.
And this is one of the things that has kind of frustrates me about the email world in
in which we live at the moment in that I know, you know,
I know the two default standards.
It used to be POP3 and now it's IMAP.
They're the kind of the two.
And then, and I know that Fastmail has created something
called JMAP, which is apparently one alphabetic increase
on IMAP, so it must be better.
But also the thing that, getting to the point
that frustrates me is I know it's based on standards,
yet whenever I go to another service
that offers to integrate with email, right?
They're like, we'll plug into your email
and we'll do something with it.
they always say direct connections to iCloud,
direct connections to 365, direct connections to Gmail,
and then there's never fast mail
or there's rarely IMAP sort of support.
And it strikes me as like, I don't understand,
like you've got this standards base,
but then they seem to kowtow to the other providers.
I don't know if that's a question
or something you can comment on.
- I think the old joke is the great thing about standards
is there's so many to choose from.
One of the things with email,
It's been, you know, it sort of started in the 70s.
Like there is a line, modern email in 2021
goes right the way back to works that was happening in 1971.
And so it's all been built out of layers and layers
and layers and layers.
And it means that not everyone has done every part
exactly the same way and not everyone has done,
you know, sometimes there's little bits of quirks
and that sort of thing in there.
So while it's okay to say,
yeah, this system supports POP3 or more recently this system supports IMAP. IMAP was standardized in
like the current base version of IMAP was standardized in the late 90s I think,
maybe early 2000s. But to build a mail system on a mail client on top of IMAP for what you would
expect to happen now, which is you know like high quality search and you know it works well on your
mobile and you can take it offline and come back and it will just synchronize up the differences
and that sort of thing. There's usually something like another 45 specs on top of that,
that you have to build. And not everyone does it exactly the same way, and all this sort of thing.
One component of that is discovery. If you come in and you're like, "Oh, I want to configure my
email client," how do you start? And there are standards for being able to basically go from an
email address to a server name and port and settings and get you to the point where you
can basically say "enter your username and your email password" and off we go.
But not everyone supports that and then if you want to build a client that also has calendar
and contacts built into that, they're entirely separate protocols, like entirely different,
mostly based on what was popular at the time. So like IMAP is an old-style line-based protocol
and Calendar and Contacts are a like web XML kind of, you know, mid-2000s kind of monstrosity. And
so it ends up being very, very difficult to actually, you pull out your new iPhone on day
one and you want to set it up for Sync Your Email, Sync Your Contacts, Sync Your Calendar, which you
definitely do. Those are great things to have in your pocket. It's actually a lot of work and it's
very difficult to onboard a user in that situation. So most clients say, "Well, you're probably on one
of Gmail, Outlook or iCloud. So why don't we just have one tap automatic setup options for those
and off we go. And it is frustrating because it is possible to not do it that way in a lot of cases,
but it's a niche at the end. Rob, there's like a hundred people in the whole universe that actually
understand how email works and you're one of them. Do you guys, and this is obviously just a secret
chat between the four of us. Do you ever, at Fastmail, do you all just get in a room and think,
"How do we just burn this to the ground and start over because it does have so much cruft going all
the way back to 1971?" Or is it more, "No, this is still kind of the best way to do it."
I think a great thing about email success is it's kind of grown up with the world around it.
any attempt to replace it, once you add in all the weird things that people use it for,
you can email people basically a web page, like a newsletter that's got lots of rich embedded stuff,
or it can be used as a transactional system to drive other... A program will receive the email
and take some action based on it. Or there's mailing lists where you send one email and it
fans out to lots of others. And web-based archives, webmail, or desktop clients.
And once you factor in all these things, I think you don't end up so far from what we have now.
But I mean, there are definitely difficulties that have made it very difficult.
I mean, like you just said, I've got a great idea and I'm going to build a new thing,
and suddenly I have to implement 273 specs and figure out how to interop with the quirks with
all these different systems and whatever else. And it's really hard. And we've seen people
try that. Within the last 10 years, you know, we've seen Gmail tried to introduce Inbox,
which was like, try the new tilt on how this would work. We saw Dropbox had a system called
Mailbox, where they were trying to do largely the same kind of thing. And there's been a couple of
smaller players that have tried to sort of re-imagine what it might look like. You know,
whether that's bringing out particular kinds of content, like here is your travel itinerary,
everything about your trip is all automatically put in this box where you can see things. And it's,
you know, we parse the emails and we try to have a standard format and we, "Oh, here's images,
great, let's put them in a carousel," and these sort of things. But the problem that
we were consistently seeing was, anytime you had a new idea, by the time you actually got the damn
thing to, you know, even just the basic thing to work, by the time you got it to speak IMAP,
by the time you got it to do these things, it was like six months later and you're crying in a
corner because and you haven't even got to building your idea yet. So the thing, the approach we
tried to take with it and open standards are really important to us, you know, for a bunch
of different reasons. But we're like, okay, we need to build an open standard here. But we also
had to build a thing here. We wanted to build mobile clients. We wanted to build a rich web-based
experience like that people expected. And we're like, okay, we can't do this with IMAP. It's gonna
suck. So we built what's a very early version of Jmap, which is now a proper web standard.
It's based on modern web standards that every, every developer in 2020 and beyond knows,
you know, just basic web calls, JSON. It's not dependent on a long-lived connection, which
IMAP is. If you get disconnected, you have to restart again, which causes a lot of battery
drain. You know, you can't really background it very easily on a mobile phone. Because it's using
standard protocols, you don't have to wonder like, "Oh, how do I parse this kind of weird text
protocol?" and all this kind of stuff. And a whole bunch of text, so it has calendars and
contacts built into it. It has the ability to let the server do a lot of the work. So you can say to
the server, "Could you give me a nice structured representation of this email?" Rather than me
having to do all the work of understanding how to parse any email that's possibly arrived in the
last 40 years, because some people have archives that long. It can just say, you know, "Email 27,
Can you give me that?" And it's like, "Yeah, here's the subject. Here's the paragraphs of
text in a nice uniform format that you can deal with."
Did Fastmail create JMap or are they just kind of at the beginning of being able to adopt it?
Because I had not heard of it until Fastmail's...
We sort of created it at the start. We built our own internal protocol for our,
the fastmail.com web UI to talk to our servers. And as we learned more about what we needed,
we gradually added to it and added to it. And then we got to the point where we're like,
"This is actually pretty cool. We'd love for other people to be able to use this." So,
we took it to the IETF, which is the Internet Engineering Task Force, which is where the
internet standards are made. And this is like an open forum, anyone can join in.
And then over the course of, I think it probably took four or five years,
we gradually refined it there. It has people from major email providers, email software vendors,
and email client developers, you know, cast of thousands, who basically... people who are
interested in email and also interested in calendar and interested in contacts. And we
were talking to them about, "Okay, well, this is what we've got." And they went, "Wow, this is
attempting to solve problems that are real and exist, and no one else has kind of brought
something like this. And it looks very, very different to where we started, and we're thankful
for that because there were so many great ideas from other people that they brought to it.
Yeah, and that was fully standardized, as in it's officially published and given a stamp of approval
by the various teams, I think, middle of last year. And we've been tracking the changes in it
as we did it. And now that's available for end users in FastMail. You can go into FastMail and
say, "Give me a password to let me do Jmap work." And there's a couple of early development Jmap
clients around the place which you can use. So it is right to say that right now, there exist
internet standards for doing modern email. Because you are who you are, you clearly,
family members that are not as tech inclined, I'm sure, bring you questions and comments.
How often do you get the, "Why is my Gmail not working?" And you're like, "Well, here we go."
Thankfully, never. My family, my extended family, are not especially tech savvy. But also,
I try to be realistic about what people need as well. I care a lot about email. But as I was
saying before, if you don't care about email, just use iCloud or whatever. It'll hook up better with
your iPad and go from there. I'm not going to try and persuade you that you should pay for
some awesome power tool or whatever when you knock a nail into the wall.
I have to admit, I do my best, but a lot of my non-technically minded friends just look at me
and think, "Why are you even investing brain space into email? Who are you?" I'm like, "Okay,
I'm a nerd. I'm sorry." It's just what you need, presumably. Presumably, you have a real need for
it. I know there's plenty of people who just like playing with cool things and you're probably that
too. But I mean it's the same reason I, you know, I have a Linux laptop because I'm a nerd and I'm
a nerd from the 90s and I never got into computers before they were good. All my kids have, you know,
Macbooks and Apple stuff and I ran a Mac for a few years and it's terrible and I'm not going to try
and convince you of that. But for them it's what their friends have, the messages app works the
The way they want it to I don't really need to think about it a lot they're happy I'm happy that's fine yeah computers are tools just reminding you that I'm the editor and this is a very dangerous section.
That's why I have not acknowledged that I am glad you have found technology technology choices that work for you and you enjoy because we should all have that.
As long as you don't shit in the iPod he's fine.
Yeah that's true.
Oh no, the iPod's the last good thing Apple did, but anyway.
There you go.
Oh, that'll make the cut.
Oh, it's a work of art, honestly.
Oh man.
Okay, where actually are you located?
Because I don't actually know where you are.
I know where they are, obviously.
Where are you?
So I'm in Melbourne, Victoria.
Okay.
I'm about 50 k's southeast of Melbourne.
So I'm in the metropolitan area, but yeah.
North of Martin, then, I believe.
South of me.
South of Martin.
Yeah.
I live in Australia I still get that mixed up.
Yeah.
Don't worry mate.
Really?
Yeah it's hard to figure I never know.
We have six cities dude come on.
But I was going to say all Australian news is dominated by the East Coast so you would only ever see things from Sydney and Melbourne anyway.
That's true.
I know that Melbourne's down the bottom Sydney's kind of on the side but where is Illawarra, Newcastle whatever I don't know where any of those places are.
Some of the war is 90 minutes out of Sydney Newcastle is like the equivalent North we just kind of like bookend Sydney but people think that we're Sydney which is disgraceful but anyway.
And WA is in the West.
Yes and that's all you really need to know.
Putting the West in WA.
But yeah no you are you are right Andrew Sydney is all the same and irrelevant and you're also right Martin no one cares about Perth so there we go.
Melbourne.
Melbourne represent.
Spoken like a true Melverdian.
(laughing)
- This is my favorite part.
Like you just have such opinions of like,
- That's a great thing.
Cause like, I'm like, these guys are Australian.
I'll totally get it.
So it's fine.
- But in all seriousness, fast mail, fantastic.
Thank you, Rob.
I really appreciate it.
Or we really appreciate it rather.
- No, as well.
Thank you.
Thank you for those words.
We do, we do take it seriously.
We try hard and I'm glad,
always glad to hear that you're enjoying the,
enjoying using it.
And we will keep working at that.
I watched the worst possible remake of a movie the other night.
I saw that and I'm very impressed you even thought that that would be worth your time.
I was looking for something that would entertain a five year old.
No, that's not going to be it. Has he seen the OG original?
Yes.
Has he seen?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
I think he preferred the original.
As did everybody on the planet.
As did the world. Yeah.
- Well, that's funny, like Home Alone,
there was Home Alone 1, great.
Home Alone 2 was like, okay, obviously a cash grab,
we're gonna do it again.
He's still a kid, let's like milk this thing
for everything it's worth.
Then that was basically where the world thought,
we've had enough, that's good, we could stop there.
And they're like, you know, we're Hollywood,
let's do the third one.
And then I think there was a fourth one.
- Did they get to six or something?
- There was a lot after the second one.
And then this one came out again, we're like,
You know what, let's reboot it, 'cause we're Hollywood,
and all we can do is reboot shit.
We can never have an original idea again.
We'll just keep remaking (beep) that people liked,
but in a much shittier way.
- I know, we're gonna remake it and make it worse,
because that's what people want.
They don't want a better effort, they want a worse movie.
- And you know what's the worst about it,
is they always try to make it as super specific
to right now as possible.
So every reference is like the thing that was funny
for a week and you're like, have you heard of Timeless?
Clearly not.
And now you've ruined the whole movie
and you've shown all these things that make it seem
that it's exactly, you could say, this is October, 2020.
We know.
- Yep.
- And yeah, it's awful.
- Martin, I was just referring to Home Sweet Home Alone.
Do not watch.
- Oh, I saw the thumbnail for that and went, do you?
- Don't do it to yourself.
- Don't do it.
- I had no plan to.
Wait until Mac is five and then crank it out.
No, that's what I've just done.
Home Alone one only.
Then Home Alone two.
If it's like a real like just we got to show something to this kid today.
Then never pass that.
Do not go past two.
See, sorry, Jason, how old were you when Home Alone two came out?
I don't know. When did Home Alone two come out?
I only ask because I saw Home Alone two was out when I was a kid.
And so my view of one and two is kind of hyper compressed into being out from around the same time.
Oh, that makes sense.
So your view of two, I really, I really like number two.
No, two was fine.
I was telling Andrew earlier, like one, perfect.
Two was like obviously a cash grab, but the kid was still young and they're like, well, we got to do another one because like-
Macaulay Culkin's not yet a crackhead.
We need to give him some more cash.
Yeah, like he hasn't done enough meth yet, so we can probably get away with a second one.
But then after that, it's like the world said we're good after two.
Like we don't.
We don't need a third. And then they're like, how about three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ten, whatever.
And it was just like, no, no.
There are clearly lots of neglected middle class kids in the US.
They've got a lot of material.
That's all we did. Yeah.
And it was just like, leave a kid somewhere, go on vacation.
It's fine. 92.
So, I was 10 years old when the second one came out.
Now, see, that's when I was born.
You were born in 1992.
Jeez.
Yes.
Jeez, I was in year 10 at high school.
So totally not interested in that movie to some old.
So that that just gives an idea of how to me they were kind of another not the same movie but they like history.
Why do you talk to me I'm such an old grandpa to you were born in 1992 correct the 90s you were born in the 90s.
I was born in the 90s.
And yet he speaks and acts like he was born in 1940s so go figure.
I was thinking like 1840s but sure.
How old did you think I was out of curiosity.
I was thinking like 89.
Oh okay just a couple more years.
Like you were 80s but you like claimed 80s still but it was like 80 like end of 89 but we're like.
I'm not even what you would call a 90s kid because I actually properly grew up in the noughties.
In the in the 2000s yeah.
So you wouldn't be familiar with Parker Lewis can't lose.
No.
What?
Exactly.
The greatest television show ever made.
He doesn't know what saved by the bell is.
Doesn't even know.
I know I'm saved by the bell, but I don't know if.
Oh man.
But not like coming home and watching it on TV after school or something like you were still like crawling.
Yeah.
We walk through snow.
Both ways.
Glass on the road, bare feet.
Just to watch Parker Lewis can't lose at four o'clock.
Did you say glass on the road?
Oh yeah.
It's like broken glass.
Wow, okay, you live in the leafy suburbs of the United States where you chase
Oh, you don't have glass on your ground
New
patrons corner
Did you guys know that there are more patrons in the hemispherian universe?
You're the disturbance in the I think it's a universe hemisphere. It's a hemispheric universe. That's what we're going with
Okay. I want to welcome Matthew. Thank you, Matthew. And John P. Notice how I
didn't dox anyone that time with their full name. You're welcome. Matthew and
John P. Thank you so much. We appreciate you being in the Patreon community and
being a hemispherian. Yes, thank you. Don't forget to go and get all the back
catalog in Patreon. There's a bunch of, what is there? There's like wallpapers,
Episodes there's blog posts there's the newsletter it's basically an endless amount of stuff.
That has an ending I'll say that.
And don't forget the discord join in there.
Oh yeah.
Don't never be shy the discord we welcome any and all comers sometimes the conversation might be to your flavor might not be to your flavor change it or come back another day but it's fine.
And for anyone who hasn't signed up it's one prime plus dot com.
One prime plus dot com.
That was a special announcer. I like to think of this show as a particularly weird program but one prime plus is where the weirdest stuff goes. Bits that didn't quite make it in. Maybe because I was being a bit of an editorial Nazi. Maybe because we didn't have time. It's all the cool stuff. So head there today.
One prime plus dot com. It's in the game.
Is that Prince of Memories?
Is that the tagline? I think so.
So many memories. It is also nostalgic November. So I just had a nostalgic moment when Jason said that because I suddenly had memories of playing all the EA Sports games on Xbox and PlayStation for many, many years. And you'd have to sit in that through that bit where the guy said, sorry, what do you say, Jason?
It's in the game.
So that's my piece of nostalgia but shit please share your piece of nostalgia anyway email it to us put it on discord put a blog post and link to it.
I put on Twitter at hemispheric pod don't do Facebook is none of us go there we won't see it but yeah share something that's nostalgic.
And at the end of the month will put it all in a blog post and share it so people can see what the community loves.
Yeah, it's in the game. Yeah, you'd be playing you'd be playing NBL 2k2 and you'd boot it up and it'd be like
Hemispheric views it's in the game and then the game would start so that's so good. He's got that American accent down pat
Yeah
It's like I live here weird
So, thank you patrons
Yeah
Funded it.
Looking at our notes, Andrew, you're going to whinge about something financial.
Go on.
Oh, here we go.
Look, you've combined two of my favorite things, whinging and finances. Bang, in the one topic.
My previous, one of my apps that I loved and supported so fervently, YNAB, otherwise known as You Need a Budget, have-
You Need a New App.
You got the community and quite the tizzy.
For a budgeting, let me just pose this to you.
If you're a budgeting app and one of your things is teaching a method by which to manage
money, and that method is to plan ahead for future expenses.
So know that you're going to have a bill in six months' time.
So start saving for it now.
And we'll give you a system and an app that will help you start saving for that thing
So that in six months time, you won't have spent that money at the casino.
You'll have it set aside, ready to go.
Okay.
Sounds great.
Tell me more.
Okay.
So then that company announces with less than one month's notice.
Oh, we're just going to drop a price increase on you.
Almost, that may potentially double the cost of our app for some people.
What?
In less than a month.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
We just decided that we looked at our, we looked at our own internal finances and
Realize we hadn't been budgeting effectively and we need a bit more revenue now I'm depressed and I have to go to the casino
There you go. It's a double whammy
man
So that isn't fair to say that this is actually an opportunity for you Andrew because now that this unexpected or you know
Short notice this message has been dropped on you. Isn't it a possibility for you to actually use some budgeting expertise to find
Something else that can be moved or reduced elsewhere to to meet the expectations of your own budget
Isn't this a test of your own skill that you can relish? Well, this is the problem. See I don't want to just this nefarious
Performance they put on I don't want to support it. So giving them more money in the face of them
Announcing this this cash grab really hurt me before I get to the answering your question. How did they announce said cash grab?
Can I guess? Yeah, please. I
I would guess that they gave you a well-crafted and in marketing speak email that was very lengthy and told you all of the reasons in which this was a good idea and that they apologize profusely for having to do this on such short notice.
But in order for the wonderful business to continue this was unfortunately a thing that had to happen despite their dreadful regret to their customer base.
I would wish they'd done something so nice is that instead they issued an in-app pop-up.
Two paragraphs basically saying I look yeah look we know that you've kept with your money but we've got to put our prices up so from.
December you'll be seeing new prices for your renewals.
I was the only option that you could actually press to dismiss it the word ok which is precisely what you want with it.
I don't even know you see the thing is I never got that pop up because I use next DNS and adblocker that blocks those sorts of pop ups from ever occurring.
I never saw it I never saw the announcement.
They didn't ever email anybody until the their forums exploded and reddit exploded with fury and outrage perhaps they could do an AMA.
Funny so that Jason I feel you've done some research they decided let's get on the front foot okay so they sent it they sent a carefully crafted email that said nothing finally.
Let's do an AMA.
Reddit that solves everything ever ask me anything right you just send your representative there and take questions from the crowd fix it how do you think that way.
I think being real with the people you know it's like I'm gonna get in there with the people and understand their needs and we're gonna get together on this and come to a resolution and everyone's gonna be okay when we leave.
That's probably what happened I imagine. So what happened basically was that the CEO came apparently the CEO Todd is a very slow typist.
Todd Todd Todd I think you should be working on typing speed we've got an episode for that.
So he didn't answer many questions.
The answers that he did gave would always start with, he could have saved himself some time here, but there was always like, look, I hear you, but.
That was like, maybe he had a text expander snippet for that. I hear you, but.
He would always go on about value.
Right.
So Todd values value.
It's the value proposition.
It's value proposition.
So his answers were so, his very few answers were so terrible.
Then the reddit community got on board and they were consistently downvoting those answers because they were terrible.
So it was just a dumpster fire.
Many, many, many long-term YNAB users have departed the service.
I have spent some time looking around at options.
Now this is the problem where it gets, this is where we get sticky moments, right?
Very difficult here.
There is no other service that is quite comparable to what YNAB offers.
Hence the reason if I look at economics, why they put up the prices, right?
It's great.
This is what the market does. They're a monopolist. Prices go up. So what have I done?
I bought myself a gift certificate for another 12 months service at the current prices.
You showed them? Man, what are they going to do now? You really stuck it to them.
I know. I gave them more money, but less money than they might otherwise have gotten.
Oh my gosh. Good on you.
And the gift certificate's digital, right? You're not actually getting something in the mail.
Well, maybe that's why it's so expensive. No, I do. They actually emailed me on that one. And the email was signed off from their no longer CEO, which is good.
Pre Todd.
Not Todd value.
Jesse Mecham, who built the company, but is no longer CEO. He's still signing off the gift certificates. Interesting to see.
Good for him.
So, yeah.
So he's still employed at least. He's still he's head of gift certificates.
Yes.
Sounds like.
Okay.
That's good.
It's a titular job.
Good for him.
So yeah, and there we go. So basically now I've got a YNAB service for the next two years.
Still doesn't support bank import in Australian banks. They recently rolled out a loan feature,
which is a hot piece of garbage. And I'll just keep doing my envelope budgeting with them though.
Okay. So it's safe to say that your referral code will be in the show notes?
Absolutely. I'm going to try and claw back some of this price increase.
Right. Right. I thought so. Okay. Great.
And is this where you announce you're giving away a gift certificate for YNAB or is that not happening?
No, that is not going to happen.
No, sorry folks.
That is not going to happen.
I love gift certificates, but that doesn't sound like the one.
So yeah, there's YNAB.
It's still, I'm very disappointed in the company.
They've let themselves down, but they're still the best option out there.
And still maybe at the current pricing, still worthy of money.
Let's say, can I pose a hypothetical for you?
Sure.
Let's say they said, you know what, Australia users,
tell you what we're going to do here.
We're going to increase your price.
What was it, 2x, 5x?
2x.
I don't remember what it was.
2x.
Let's say we're going to boost it up 2x.
I know that sounds like a lot, but what we're going to do
is we're expanding our bank integration into your market.
We're also, we're taking feedback and we're working on making that mortgage thing that
you have labeled, let me check my notes, a hot piece of garbage to be a less warm, more
room temperature, potentially, piece of garbage.
Would that entice you at this 2x price increase?
It might just get me over the line because the app is still going to deliver genuine.
What if I told you that we're increasing the price 2x,
but what if we're increasing the value 8x?
Does that help you at all?
- Value, yes.
Not only am I happy, Todd's happy at that point.
- Todd value is increasing the value.
- That's really good.
- I just want to check.
I don't speak for them, obviously,
but they're listening.
Obviously, they're going to listen
because this is probably where they get
most of the referrals from the show.
So I just want to let them know that more value would be valuable to their valuable customers who value value.
It just hurts me so much.
You know, this is an app that I use.
I use it daily.
I love a budget.
I love looking at my budget.
You have it in your dock. I just want to point out you have this ugly app in your dock.
I just want to make sure everybody knows that.
I love it. Love it on mobile.
Love it on the Mac.
It's a valuable app for you, we could say.
Right? Is it a valuable app?
Yeah. A lot of value.
Yeah. Todd's app.
Very valuable.
It does good things but they're they're quickly they're quickly
Going into a dark place. They need to course-correct. That's too bad. You heard it here get on it
Why and a be maybe work on that Nate workshop that name a little bit - would be maybe
No valuable. I used to consider myself a wine never sure I am anymore
The remarkable - I recently watched a YouTube video of
someone in a governmental position in
Australia
Not gonna name names and there was a remarkable - in the shot
From which things were being read which leads me to believe that it must be a pretty okay product that's still being used
How's that going in the WA household if it were I don't want to call anybody out like let's just say theoretically
They lived in WA and you heard about it because everybody kind of knows everybody there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How's that going?
I think I know the person to whom you're referring
Yeah, I figured you might remarkable - still going very well had a bit of an upset recently though
They you may have heard that they've moved to a subscription as a service
Okay, yeah, only one month's notice. I hear yes spiral pretty much it was and it was a pop-up
The only thing the only thing that was saved was that this person had bought the remarkable before
So they were grandfathered in so let's see how long
Nice nice love that so they still get what is the subscription to a remarkable?
What that would do for you think it's just like cloud sync
Which kind of seems fundamental to the product which was free when you bought the product. I'm assuming. Yep
Yep, so basically it's just to my way of understanding. It's like a way of getting it from
something from a computer to a remarkable without having to plug it in.
So the margin on the hardware was ultra low but they did it anyway to get him
out the door and then realized this margin isn't going to cut it. I think so.
Okay. But all that aside let's throw that out the window because we're
grandfathered so we love that grandfathered lifestyle. We were
grandfathered and then but then the software update you had to accept the
the new terms and conditions and that.
- Oh, T's and C's.
- Yeah, and apparently that bricked
the whole process anyway.
- I'm sorry, what it bricked the?
- It bricked the device and the sync service.
- The terms and conditions bricked the device.
- The T's and C's were accepted.
- That's a hardcore T's and C's.
(laughing)
Decline bricked.
- The grandfathering process didn't really seem to work
because at that point nothing worked.
There was no connection between devices.
- Is there a gift certificate you can buy to?
There was communication with the help desk there was videos of the process sent because they didn't believe anything until you video it and show them.
I wouldn't know.
To their credit I don't think they ever responded to the final support ticket and the video that was sent but it suddenly started working again so we're gonna call that a win and move on.
But as a device still good is that fair to say?
Still beloved.
But I love it in the household.
Maybe think about buying it as a new customer today.
Yes, I would be cautious of it.
Really make sure you look at the fine print.
Got it.
But as a device, if you just want something that you can take notes on in meetings and
you're not like a put the laptop up in front of somebody and slam around a keyboard, you
want to do handwritten, but you want to be able to text recognize stuff later, hand it
off to an assistant to be able to do some more work with.
I'm big on that.
Remarkable too. That's where it's at.
Okay, good. Just want to check in.
So I saw it.
I forgot about it entirely and it
sparked my interest because I saw it
still existed.
I think this is a prime example
of a product that can easily fall
into the drawer product,
I guess, as I'll call it, where
seems cool, is fun
for two weeks and then immediately
goes in a drawer somewhere and it's
never heard from again.
You're right and I know this is beloved because the amount of upset and angst that the the failure of the sync service caused in the
Household was it was palpable
So we need to get that fixed pronto because there was anxiety from not having the remark
You probably almost lost your job because of it. You probably almost got fired. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so remarkable - thank you
Well considered beep bop boop beep boop. Hi Pedro
I just wanted to say hi to Pedro because Pedro emailed me recently on my personal internet blog that is a
Internet website where I write content if no one's ever heard of a blog
And he listens to the show and I believe he found me through the show
I'm not really sure but I wanted to say hello to Pedro in case he still listens
Maybe you only listen to one we don't know but if you still here hello Pedro, that'd be nice
I love the idea of Pedro just listening to our show just cruising the streets maybe on a little walk and suddenly he's like whoa
They're talking about me. Yeah, it was it was an interesting. I don't get a lot of email or
contact through my my internet location on the web
But you know every once in a while somebody will come across it. I don't know how they find it maybe through
micro blog maybe through a good old-fashioned internet search perhaps
Maybe my SEO is not as bad as the spam emails would lead me to believe of all the people
Wanting to help me out with my SEO optimization
But yeah Pedro had a great question about the the home wiki that I had talked about previously
On the I think I maybe talked about it here, too. I don't remember now
But yeah, hi Pedro. Thanks for listening. Appreciate it, but it raises a really interesting point that I've been thinking about
I know that Eric in our listenership in our audience and he's active on discord has talked about how he listens or has listened to our show while doing his like jog training or running or something.
Yeah he runs a lot.
And it does make you think, yeah he's running all the time.
I don't know how he does it.
I think he runs while he discords.
I think so.
That's hard.
Anyway, I was just thinking in what way do people actually listen to this show?
Are we a relaxing show?
Are we like a highly charged show or do we compliment work?
I mean, we're just sitting here having a chat, having a good time, but I'd be interested to know
if any listeners want to send us something at hemisphericviewsonmicro.blog or at hemisphericpod
and tell us how you listen to this show or what it's good or bad for. Does it complement work?
Is it distracting? I'd be really interested to know that.
That's a good question because there are certain shows that I listen to where I can't,
it's like strictly a while I'm driving show or some things I can do while I'm doing work,
But others I can't that's a good I don't know what this would be
I remember Gabby when he shared his desk photo
So he would listen I think he'd mentioned he listened to us at his job
You know that you know his desk where it's like in the dead of night. He's in that
Sheltered bunker thing with no windows. Yeah, yeah could be any time of the day or night poor guy. Yes the corn
He'd like was in the cornfields listening to us at night. It was odd
It was almost like a cult thing, which maybe we are. I don't know if we are that's fine
Maybe he's a child of the corn.
This could I would like to know the answer that question I think I like to think we're driving podcast.
Who am I to say.
I think as long as anybody's listening to it I don't really care where they're doing it I think it's as long as it's not an unsubscribing podcast I'm happy.
