[MUSIC PLAYING]
OK.
So I like your little method you had there, actually.
Do you do that for real?
Because I'm finding my ears are getting very hot in these headphones lately.
And I don't know if that's just a me thing.
I like lifting the headphones, little post-lighting, release, release,
release.
It's just like a little.
(blows)
- It's an occasional thing that I do
to pretend that it's working
and then I realized that I just look stupid and I stop.
But I'm glad.
- I feel like some little fans in there
would not be a bad addition.
- Fans.
- Would Apple add fans to AirPods Max?
That's a very interesting question.
- I don't know.
I mean, if they got all those extra fans
from not putting them in computers,
they gotta put them somewhere, right?
Like let's put them in the headphones
and then you got little, ooh, and then it's cool.
- Imagine if they added a USB-A port
to the outside of each cup.
And then you can put those little things.
- Those little extra fans, yes.
- And then you just blow in, they'd love that.
It'd be kind of like the Apple headphone equivalent
of wearing those straw hats, not like out of straw,
but when you go to a baseball game
and you've got the thing from the beer cans.
- Beer hat, beer hats.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
- Except it's USB-A fans on your AirPods.
- If they're gonna add anything,
it's more USB-A and more fans.
That seems logical for them to do.
So I'm for that.
- They can't use lightning.
- No, we should all go back to USB-A
'cause clearly that was the right way.
Third time's a charm, every time.
- I love those fans 'cause you know how at the end
they have that little material that's really soft
so you can stick your finger in them
without hurting yourself?
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- Which you'd always do 'cause you're kind of just like,
I like danger, but I don't like it that much,
but I like danger just enough to touch a foam fan.
Like that's the limit. - Yeah.
- Is every airplane that flies in European airspace
gonna have to switch from USB-A ports to USB-C?
- What, to power the plane?
anything like Australia, like do you know how long it took us to get USB-A ports in an airplane?
I reckon they were probably only probably only three years ago that it became standard.
Yeah, I can't even imagine that that's going to happen in any reasonable amount of time.
And they'll do like the wrong version too, you know, they'll pick, even if it's USB-C,
they'll pick like USB-C, but it'll be some dumb ass version of it that then we'll be stuck with
for 10 more years, but everybody will be happy
'cause we're all standardized.
It's like, cool.
It charges my phone if I fly around the globe eight times.
Perfect, thank you for that.
- Well, talking about planes,
I don't know if you meant that as a segue
to Jason's topic, Andrew, but that was masterful
'cause Jason's been traveling.
- Yes, that's exactly what I meant.
I was gonna ask Jason if he reflected on his USB ports
on his travel plane.
- In the Zoom window, I saw Andrew actually go by
on a segue right then as he was saying that.
That's how good that segue was.
So yes.
I would like to introduce a new corner.
I don't remember if you all recall
that we had Corner Corner not too long ago.
But in Corner Corner, we actually,
there were some corners that didn't exist in Corner Corner.
So I'd like to introduce Travel Corner,
which for obvious reasons, for the last,
How long has this thing been going on now?
Like 18 and a half years we've been in this pandemic thing, I think,
roughly give or take.
So travel has not really been like a big deal. Um, not for me anyway.
I don't think I've traveled in three ish years,
but I did recently travel and by travel,
I mean actually left my home in a car, went to an airport,
got on an airplane, flew a distance to a different state.
I didn't leave the country. I didn't go crazy,
but I did go to a different state.
So in some ways it's kind of like going to a different
country. I won't mention where I went.
It's not one of the better ones.
I will leave that up to the listeners to figure out which
state that was,
but not having traveled for several years,
some things came to mind in terms of,
We talk about technology from time to time.
I got to say air travel has not changed in many years,
which is somewhat surprising. First of all,
I thought things would be fancy and new and changed. No,
it's still basically a shit show all around in terms of travel,
but there were a couple of things that stuck out to me and I wanted to run these
by you to see if, well, actually let me stop. First of all,
have either of you traveled in any significant way via airplane in the last,
in let's even just say this year, I know Andrew did a trip up to basketball
Ville.
Yes.
I went to Darwin for basketball Ville.
I also did a small one to, um, X math or X math.
Remember X math?
I do.
I do recall that when you, the satellite call in, I recall that.
And roughly that was a, how long travel distance by flight was that X math?
I think it was two and a half hours.
And Darwin was four and a half.
All right, not too bad.
Martin, travel in the last year?
I mean, obviously you've got a lot going on,
so I'm assuming not, but--
- I'll be traveling somewhere for work pretty soon,
but no, not in the last year or two.
Nothing significant. - Okay.
So I flew West Coast to East Coast,
which is, it takes a while, you know,
by the time you change planes and so forth.
Overall, traveling still sucks, so spoiler,
it's still not that great.
But there were a couple of things that I found to be interesting.
So first of all, going through the security situation in the United States is just as miserable as ever.
So good job there.
Glad to see we're still...
- TSA haven't chilled out yet.
Is that what you're saying?
- No, it's still awful.
- Okay.
- Shoes off?
- Shoes...
Sorry, I've got a question.
Shoes off or shoes on?
- Oh, yeah.
So I do have the quote unquote luxury of TSA pre-check and global entry.
So I keep my shoes on cause you know, America, but the thing that I found to
be the most intriguing is I get to my gate and I'm sitting there and, you
know, doing our thing where you're just sitting there waiting, like, when is
this pain and suffering going to end?
And we go to get on the plane and there's the usual,
surprise, surprise, there's not enough overhead bin storage
for everyone, we're gonna ask folks to volunteer
to check bags.
Well, I'm sure as hell not doing that, so okay,
sounds good, good on you.
Then they make the announcement about smart luggage.
- Okay, we didn't have that.
- Those faces are exactly what my face was,
was a (beep) smart luggage.
What is it like, okay, I missed something
in the last three years, we now have smart luggage.
Now we know everybody adds smart to basically everything
to make it trendy and hip and whatever and fashionable
'cause it's technology, cool, it's smart, okay.
So I'm like, what the hell is a smart luggage?
Now I'm like, okay, I gotta get me a smart luggage.
Obviously, I'm behind the times, I have a dumb luggage
that just holds my clothes.
Who am I over here just, you know, living in the past?
And I'm sitting and waiting more and more
and waiting and waiting.
And they're like, okay, if you're checking smart luggage,
be sure to remove the battery.
I'm like, wow, like is it driving itself?
What is this luggage doing that is so intelligent and smart?
Is it like a Roomba carrying your clothes?
I love it, let me get one.
And I'm waiting and I'm waiting longer.
Turns out, smart luggage is literally just a battery
in a suitcase, that's it.
It's an external battery pack that just slots
into a suitcase so you can charge your phone.
How is that smart?
So you duct tape a battery to a suitcase
and it's smart now, I've seen it all.
- It sounds very dumb, at least in the airport situation,
because then you have the hassle of having to dismantle it
to get onto the plane.
- Thank you, yes, so this smart object is actually idiotic
because you have to disassemble your suitcase
to get on the damn plane, so that's dumb.
So the second piece to this is I'm thinking,
okay, fine, a battery,
maybe you don't wanna keep it in your backpack.
Where do you put that suitcase when you bring it on?
In the overhead compartment,
which is inaccessible to you sitting in your seat.
So now to charge your thing,
You have to go get the battery out of the suitcase,
bring it back down to where your backpack it.
I don't, I'm completely lost as to how this is a thing.
So that's the major shift in travel
in the last three years.
- What if like in the center console of a car,
you have that little hole that comes out of that compartment
where you can have a cable running out to your iPhone,
but in this case, it's vertical
because it's from the overhead compartment.
- Yeah.
- It drops down like an oxygen mask
And then you're essentially holding your phone upside down
to allow the lightning or USB-C port to connect.
And then you have to actually use your phone upside down
as a faux oxygen mask from the ceiling.
- That could work.
I could see that being feasible.
I still think maybe just keep a battery
in your backpack with you would be probably fine, but okay.
Anyway, that was point number one.
Point number two, air tags.
- I haven't left the house in 15 years.
I left the house with all of my air tags.
I had air tags on all kinds of things
just because I had them.
And I wanted to have air tags on things
because I felt better about it.
- When you say everywhere,
they didn't have to like pull you aside
and check that it was somewhere else in particular.
- No, this was not the airline
that freaked out about air tags.
This was, they were sensible
and they did not care that I had air tags.
- So no body cavities or your-
- No.
- Okay.
- Nope.
that they know of, wink, wink.
(laughing)
- Correct.
- So, AirTags, I had on my items.
I used to, I'll preface this with,
I used to be really good at travel.
I was like, travel guy, knew what to do,
had all of my systems.
I haven't done it in a while, so I was a little rusty.
So, AirTags, I have to say, they win the day.
They absolutely saved my ass when I was coming back
from my destination back to home
because I did the thing where I left my iPad mini
in my hotel room.
Because I did not do a thorough sweep of the room
before I left.
- That's a rookie mistake.
- It is absolutely a rookie mistake.
And also I was horribly hungover,
but that had nothing to do with it.
It was all because it was a rookie mistake.
And we're gonna just make sure that everybody realizes that.
So I leave the hotel.
I look at my wrist 'cause it buzzes and it says,
"You left your iPad behind."
And I was like, "No, no I didn't.
"That's insane, I would never do that."
So I look at my backpack, holy shit,
nope, I did leave it behind, it is not in my backpack.
So I was able to go back to the hotel,
get my iPad, secure it, bring it with me to the airport,
everything is fine, I was so excited about that.
And the other thing was that I also have,
so that was not AirTag specifically,
that was just the Find My thing.
But I had also left an item behind that had an AirTag on it.
So I got that item back at the exact same time.
So yes, I left not one, but two items in my hotel room,
like an idiot.
- You're really high, I bet.
- And so I got them back without having to deal
with the whole like calling the hotel later
and then being like,
"We don't know where these super expensive items are.
They're just gone.
Like, okay.
So thank you.
Air tags.
Thank you.
Find my, I absolutely love it.
All of the times that I've had false positives on find my don't care.
I would rather be overburdened by this than have it not work once.
Uh, so air tag slash find my thank you.
And that is all I have for travel corner.
Other than that, it was a uneventful, mostly terrible adventure traveling.
I thought travel corner might involve some things like, you know, we, we had a swim by the pool and we had a pina colada and
Oh,
airplanes suck.
And I've got air tags like that's Jason's travel experience.
Okay.
So wait, hold on.
I didn't have to take my shoes off.
I didn't have to take my shoes off.
Hold on.
This was strictly talking about the travel itself.
Destination was phenomenal.
That was like a week of gold.
It was, I'm strictly focused on the actual travel piece in between
destination and origination. That's all I'm talking about here.
When I got there, phenomenal. Everything was great.
It's that in between part that is that, you know,
that hellish being in airports kind of situation that I was mostly focusing on
here. So travel.
- I have a question very briefly about your hotel room.
Did you use any provided iron and ironing board?
- I did.
- How was that experience?
- It was actually fine.
I found the, so if I had to rate the iron,
I would say nine out of 10 on the iron itself.
Yeah, really good iron.
It has a retractable, like the auto retractable cord,
very high quality iron.
The ironing board, I would probably have to like...
- Were there questionable stain marks on it?
- No, no, no. - That's good.
- I think the ironing board just looked,
it was very well loved and used.
So I think it was probably, I'd give it like a seven,
seven out of 10 for the ironing board.
- Was it appropriate for your height?
Did it bring it up to an ergonomic level?
- Height was okay.
I had a little bit of trouble getting it to re-collapse.
There was some collapse issues.
The mechanism, again, well-loved.
Could use a little once over, I think.
- 3D40.
- Yeah, it could use a little bit there, I think.
But overall, ironing board and iron were top quality,
good pieces of kit, yeah.
- Why do you ask that question?
- That's a great question.
I was slightly scarred by an ironing experience at a hotel.
So it was just interesting to me
if he had a high quality experience where he went.
- Just bloodstains everywhere.
I wasn't burnt like George Costanza
and ruining my hand model career or something.
All it was, was I went to go and iron some clothes
while I was away on a trip
and I've pressed the button to like do the steam.
And I know it wasn't this, but it's like all of this,
it's like it was stuffed with cocaine
and this white cloud just came out of it.
It was just this white cloud of dust or powder or something.
I've gone, well, thank you for ruining my clothes.
And so now I've always been very, very sus
Hotel provided irons just thinking that they've stuffed some foreign material in there interesting. I've never used a hotel iron. Why would I?
I've been working hard to maintain happiness in the family and one of the things that Benji was particularly
Concerned about is that once you may recall David had a guest appearance on this show. He did yes
All week he's been asking if he can do a guest appearance on hemispheric views
Yeah why not it's what everyone's asking I mean let's just be real it's it all I see on the internet every day is like how do I get on that show.
Particularly in primary schools because I remember when they banned Pokemon cards they were so popular and causing fights this is a real issue.
This is next yeah they're gonna be like no absolutely not we're not talking about the show anymore.
And they say to build a podcast audience we're looking for how do we build our audience so we say have guests on right because that'll spread the word.
So I'm wondering if in the interest of maintaining my parental sanity and getting me through this next week and making a
Six almost seven year old very happy if we can quickly have Benji on for a guest appearance
It depends on how close to seven he is
Because if this is one of those like six going on seven and he's not seven for like eight months
Now he's like December. So we're what are we October?
It's just number what because I'm warming up to it because I'm also December so December what is it an auto even number not to throw?
His you know personal private identification out there. It's an odd number and it is
So am I okay?
Okay, it's very close to it's very close to Christmas. Is it close to the middle ish?
Yeah
Okay, all right it is also just it's the 23rd of December
Oh festivals. Yeah, have him on bring him in. No, it's too far from my
City is stage fright. Hang on
He's gonna shut down completely. Just be like, all right, so while he goes and gets him do we hang out?
We just turn off your video
Wait, how do I do it stop?
Here, here.
- Why is there a mole?
- You put this on, and you come right up close to the microphone.
Hello there.
How's it going?
Good to have you on the show.
Good afternoon.
Or wait, what time is it there?
What time is it there, Benji?
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Did you have breakfast yet?
- Yes.
- What'd you have?
Eggs?
Bacon?
- No.
- Bacon?
- No.
- Bacon?
I don't even like eggs.
- You don't like eggs?
- No.
- Okay.
- Let's talk about that.
Why don't you like eggs?
What's wrong with eggs?
- I don't know.
- Okay, fair.
- Is it the white bit or the yellow bit that you don't like?
- I think I like the white bit,
but I don't like the yellow bit.
- Oh, you're an egg whites.
Okay, fair.
- The yellow bit's a bit weird, isn't it?
- So an egg white omelet would be like right up your alley.
(laughing)
- Okay, now I've got a big question for you, Benji, right?
- Big question. - Okay.
- You're at home with your dad and your brother.
- Yeah. - Which one is more annoying?
- My brother.
- Ooh, good save.
Okay. - Yeah, okay.
- What does your brother do to annoy you?
- I don't know.
- Well, that's good.
What do you and your brother do that is fun?
- Probably sometimes bouncing on the trampoline with him.
- That's fun. - Ooh, I could see that.
- Yep.
- Do you try to jump a bit higher than he does?
You really get up there?
- Yeah, I'm very, I jump very high now.
- Humble.
- Just like his dad.
- Yep.
- Do you like basketball?
- Not too much now.
I think I like soccer a bit better.
- Yeah, we're the same.
- Yeah.
- What's better about soccer?
What do you like about soccer?
- Just everything maybe.
Well, I think my favorite thing would be being the goalie.
- Hmm. Is that because you get to use your hands too?
You get to do more than everyone else?
- No, I just think it's a bit fun
'cause you get to walk the shots.
- Ah, good point.
- Can I ask you the most important question of all?
So in the world of shapes, what is your favorite shapes?
And I'm referring to the biscuits.
- Yeah, the ones with the flavors that you can see.
- Yeah.
- Probably the oval ones.
- Oh, the chicken crimpy.
- I didn't know that's what they were called.
- Yeah.
- With the little holes in them?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
They are awesome. - Chicken crimpy.
Yeah.
- Chicken crimpy is a favourite.
Good on you.
I have a question about wrestling,
'cause I know your dad's really into wrestling.
Do you like wrestling too?
- Yeah, I even have some wrestling toys.
- You do?
Okay, which one's your favourite?
Can you tell us about that?
probably the stage where you get to break it but then you can put it back together.
And also the ambulance where you get to break it and put it back together.
What's the ambulance called though?
The ambulance, remember it's got a name?
I forgot what it's called.
It's called the whambulance.
What?
Whambulance.
Whispering.
Slambulance.
The slambulance.
The slam you want of course, so if you if it Benji if you had to just give a bit of advice to
Hundreds of millions of people who listen to this show. Hmm. What would that advice be?
I think that it was would be
Hundreds of millions of people what what would you just want to tell everyone like what is just the one thing top of mind?
What is that?
Question it is it's a very tough questions
But you're on the spot and you're like you got to go quick
Tell them you got 30 seconds to tell the whole entire world this one thing. What would it be?
Go be more negative because I'm negative
Okay. Yeah
That's definitely a that's one. Yep. What if you had to give like a second one?
What if there was a second one you had to give?
- Just to build on the first one.
(laughing)
- Be mean.
- Okay, all right.
Be, yep, got it.
All right.
- I think what we can take from this,
what Benji's saying, right?
Which I think is very clever,
is that the world can be a nasty place.
- It can be.
- And you can't let people push you down and keep you down.
You gotta...
- Sell other things.
Don't let out or do graffiti.
'Cause a lot of people where I live do a lot of that.
- Does your dad do it?
You can be honest with us.
- Yeah, he just Perth bandits everywhere.
- Do you go out for lunch sometimes
and the bins right there, but your dad goes,
can't be bothered, just drop it here.
And you go, no dad, take it to the bin.
- Take it to the bin, but negatively.
- I don't actually do that any.
(laughing)
I don't, I never do that.
- No, that's good.
- Don't do whatever.
- Don't graffiti unless it looks nice.
- Tell you to put something in the bin at lunch.
- Yeah.
- Now Benji, I think you need to tell your dad now
that he can go now because you're the new co-host
on the show.
Like that's it, just tell him.
- Yeah, he can.
- Yeah, you gotta tell him though.
- You gotta tell him he can't hear us.
- You can go now?
- No, you.
- I go now, oh.
(laughing)
- You're never being in this podcast again.
(laughing)
There's that mean advice he just gave.
Well, Martin, that's what you've got to look forward to in approximately four years.
Good luck with that.
So we'll be having Mac on.
So, yes, stay tuned.
That's four years time.
We'll get Mac on, guest appearance.
It'll be its own segment called Mac advice and everyone will be completely thrown off.
So f***ing confused.
They're like, oh, good Mac tips.
Negative what the fuck is going on here?
What's wrong with you all down there?
Jeez.
Hey, we're gonna talk, Martin actually, I think has a really good topic now, a topic that we all love to discuss.
Oh, what's that?
Big social media.
So what are we gonna talk?
We're gonna talk Elon Musk and Twitter.
Nope.
What's the conversation point today, Martin?
So I just put down very eloquently in the notes, Meta's VR stuff, because, you know, it's just a
long list of controversial and technological things that they've announced. Did either of you
to watch any of the material that went out with that cringe-worthy keynote about their
Meta Quest Pro stuff and the headsets?
I saw bits and pieces of it, but nothing about the technical, more about the fraudulent use of legs.
You mean with the avatars?
Yeah.
I saw one headline that said something to the effect of that they made a thing that
looked like it was from 2004 and then promised that they would work really hard to make it
look like it was from 2009.
That was something to that effect.
That was the year of Snow Leopard, so I'm excited.
Oh my God, I hate you.
Nothing but love, Jesus.
I love that intro video.
I stick on Exodus, honey, occasionally,
just for a bit of a laugh.
Anyway, yeah, I brought this up
because I don't know how many people
actually follow Meta very closely.
I'm not a fan of Meta and Facebook
and a lot of connected social media stuff anyway,
but it's a reality that exists with us.
And rather than covering everything,
I'll just go through it quickly.
'Cause I have a question that I wanna ask both of you
about it, which I'm gonna get to
very broadly about the technology.
So for anyone who's not familiar,
you've got VR, virtual reality,
AR, augmented reality headsets, mixed reality coming out of that, and Meta, the rebranded
Facebook. Their mission, now set by Mark Zuckerberg, is essentially to have an entirely new platform
for the future where rather than being stuck using these mobile phones in our pockets and
desktop and laptop computers and tablets, we can be liberated by putting something on
our head that covers our eyes and then layers virtual things over our environments or giving
us new places to work and play and meet other people.
Cool.
Now, technologically, very impressive.
You've got face tracking, different collaborations with Microsoft for teams and so on.
But it's really all about, I think we can say safely, Zuckerberg wanting to not have
to play nice in other people's sandboxes or platforms.
He wants to own the technology of the future.
He's mad that he didn't make the iPhone.
That's it.
Let's just be obvious here.
mad that he didn't make Android or iOS.
That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You were going to say something too, Andrew?
I was just going to say, cool.
Sorry, that's my whole thing.
This guy is playing billions of dollars of other people's money on this folly.
And it's going nowhere fast.
And for all that, it's like, wow, cool.
It is super impressive that you can lose $46 billion and still exist.
Yeah.
In all seriousness, Martin, you wanted to actually discuss this. So please continue.
What I was kind of thinking when watching all this stuff was this is really technologically
impressive stuff, right? And yes, as you both said very clearly, they've thrown all of this
money at it and will continue to do so. But aside from all of that technological innovation,
and aside from the fact that it's meta and all of the connotations and negative brand feelings
that come with that for a lot of people, I'm someone who's never used VR in any meaningful way.
I think I'd actually be quite sick based on my experience just watching a screen close to my
face on an aeroplane on the back of a seat. So I don't really feel like I'm in a position to
judge the technology properly or make assumptions about it. So I wanted to really question that
point that Zuckerberg's been making about this isn't where we want it to be yet. This is really
a long-term project for the future to make something that is lighter, you know, carry
around, whether it's something like what Apple will do in the future or not. So my question is,
considering the long-term vision of this, do either of you think that headsets of any form
will be a meaningful mainstream product that attracts younger future generations away from
things that you control purely with your hands, like phones and laptops. Do you think this is
where the future is actually heading? - It sounds like you're questioning
the long game here. And I think if there's any podcast that's qualified to talk about the long
game, it would be this one. So I do appreciate that tie in. So thank you for that. And I would say
Anybody thinking about this question in general,
abstract away meta Facebook, put in your absolute favorite company, whatever,
and pretend like they're doing it and answer it that way.
Because it's super easy.
I mean, as we've already seen, the second you brought it up,
all we did was shit talk everything about meta because it's the company, right?
Yes, you've branded my question.
Right. So like abstract that away.
Let's just pick whatever company.
I don't care what it is.
Or it's just, it's a brand new company you know nothing about.
- Yeah, throw aside all of the control of the platform, whether it's one or many companies or who it is.
I'm just talking about the actual putting this thing on your head and wanting to spend time with it every day.
- For this rare instance, let's focus on the actual technology itself and forget the rest of it.
So I think to your point, you know, right now, I think everyone's big conundrum is like, we're addicted to devices.
and we have these tablets and these phones and we can't get off these phones
and tablets. So on the very surface level to say, well,
the way to fix that is to strap it to your face.
A hundred percent of the time doesn't seem like the most appropriate answer to
the quote problem,
but I'm going to even go step away from that and pretend like that's not even a
problem at this point. And that's, let's pretend it's a choice. Okay. You know,
yes, there's arguments on both sides,
But from a VR, AR, MR standpoint, I absolutely believe there is a place for that kind of
technology in our lives for very specific purposes. You mentioned VR making you ill,
which is an absolute problem for a lot of people, and it's gotten better over time as refresh rates
have gotten better, resolutions gotten better. The technology is advancing and making that less of an
issue. We have a whole VR setup at our house for doing VR gaming, which we love. It's fun. It's a
new, different way to experience gaming, which also coincidentally, weirdly brings in an exercise
angle to gaming, which has never really been a thing before. So I think that's an interesting
idea. Also, I think in the business space, I remember five years ago now, I went up to Redmond
to visit Microsoft to talk to them about when they were starting to develop the HoloLens.
HaloLens? No, it can't be HaloLens. It's got to be HoloLens.
- H-O-L-O-N.
- HaloLens would be too on the nose. The HoloLens 2, when they were starting to develop that,
And they had very immersive demo sessions for,
if you're gonna be somebody
that's manufacturing motorcycles,
like having this on your head
will show you exactly what thing to pick up
and what tool to use and the proper steps.
And it was effectively a how-to guide
that was augmented overlay onto what you were doing.
And it was hugely impressive.
And then it was like, okay,
for that instance, it makes a lot of sense,
but then to take that into my home, maybe less so.
So I think there's going to be very proprietary ways to use this technology.
But in general, I do think AR, VR and MR all are,
are we calling it XR?
I feel like at one point they were calling it XR cause it was sort of a all
encompassing thing, but whatever,
just putting a thing on your face that's a computer,
let's just call it that face computer.
- I don't know why Apple would call it XR,
which is another issue, that's fine.
- There you go, yeah.
So if you put a XR on your face,
which is a phone they don't make anymore,
to add more confusion.
I do think the face computer is valid for certain things.
The problem is when I think we start to talk about,
let's put this on your face 24 hours a day,
which is sort of what I feel like they're trying to push,
that this is gonna be every day, all day in your life,
it's gonna do everything,
which is what we said about phones 10 years ago,
and that hasn't happened.
So it's hard to believe that this more intrusive,
more hard to scale to a point
that it lasts longer than a day.
We don't even have phones that last longer than a day,
let alone a giant headset
that's effectively two phones in front of your face.
It doesn't seem like in the near future
that's gonna be possible,
but I do think that they all are valid options,
just not in the way that they're being presented
to us today that, forget hanging out with people
in real life, we're just gonna go into fake Facebookverse
and hang out there.
Maybe, but I think that is a idea that's coming
from the company that's directly creating it/directly
profiting from it, trying to push it,
More than consumers actually wanting that as a thing.
- Yeah.
- And I will stop now on my rant.
- That sort of rant was very comprehensive.
- At the risk of sounding like a boomer,
who's like, "It's technology,
you and your kids and your technology."
No, I don't think this is ever gonna really take off.
I think it's a solution searching for a problem.
They need, you know, it seems like it should be a good idea
so they're trying to will it into existence.
I think it's a bit like the Segway,
We talked about Segways earlier, I think it's a bit like that.
Segway was meant to be this revolutionary transport device
that everybody would adopt.
And they looked super cool in, like from a distance.
And then you realized, hang on, they're a bit naff.
It's really expensive.
I look like an idiot.
I feel like an idiot.
I'm never gonna buy or use a Segway.
And I think this might go in a similar direction.
And now we've ended up with kind of e-scooters,
kind of like the modern Segway but they're not really the same. It's like a derivative more basic version of it. I think as well VR will probably find a way into niche applications like niche industrial applications.
We have to explore this mind site and we don't want to send people into the mind site so we're going to create a VR environment or we need to work on this component and we're going to VR it rather than.
So I think industrial applications will have a thing in the way that segues and now like
Really popular amongst more cops and airport people going back to flight country flight corner. Hmm
Yeah, so I think that's it'll have a place but no and the way that they're selling it now like every consumers gonna have one
No, nobody wants to look like an idiot wearing a head thing
and
then other people who don't mind feeling like like looking like an idiot are gonna get sick wearing them because as good as they get
They're not that's not how the human eye is designed and I don't think we can overcome biology that if that easily
So I think it's a pipe dream. I think a lot
Meta is burning a lot of capital on a dream of Zuckerberg's and I think Zuckerberg's at the end of his rope
I think basically let's get rid of him. He's gone crazy
We got a succession style, okay, okay
We're gonna get rid of the old the old boy at the top of the tree as the TV show succession
Dictates let's sweep them out. Let's get something new in ring bring in rocket boy. Hey, yeah
I will add one additional point that
Also a handful of years ago when I was in a previous life doing medical device
stuff we did actually
design and build out a VR environment for training of medical devices.
And it was,
it was hugely popular and very effective at getting people as close to the OR
as possible without the actual need or expense of being in an OR environment
with an actual, you know,
everything being sterile and clean and operating on actual patients.
The fact that they could get accustomed to the devices prior to those devices
as being in their hands for actual patient procedures
actually turned out to be pretty impactful.
And I don't know how else we would have done that
outside of a VR environment, being able to do that
not only in person in sessions, but also remotely.
There's those kinds of things.
But again, what is the solution there?
Is it just gaming?
Is that enough?
I don't know.
There might need to be something like a, you know,
manufacturing floor where they're gonna spend
$800 million on these things to help them with their manufacturing whereas people buying games at 10 bucks a pop is probably not going to do it.
Jason are you familiar with the Nintendo power glove?
Yeah of course.
I think that might solve all your problems.
Well to sum up this episode Andrew.
Alright.
Tell us about your latest ascension, your ascent up the social ladder.
Yes okay.
Tell us why you're leaving the podcast because of your new job.
You'll know guys that I am bifurcated.
I am a tech nerdy kind of podcast guy with hemispheric views, but there's a ulterior Andrew, a two-faced.
Essential Andrew.
Essential Andrew, who is very engaged in the National Basketball League of Australia.
And I do a podcast, NBL Pocket Podcast, about that.
And for the past two years, I've had media accreditation with the league.
Last year, didn't really use it much because COVID and all difficulties and all that kind
of stuff didn't really play out.
This year, I have it and I've been more active.
Obviously, I went to Darwin for the preseason event.
And a couple of times this year, I've joined in on post-game press conferences via Zoom
As a they allow me media accredited media to join the zoom conference I took it to another level guys this week I attended a live game in Perth.
As the wildcats took on the southeast melbourne phoenix with my press lanyard around my neck.
Entry into the stadium and then went into the press room after the game and ask my questions manna and manna.
Right there does that mean free entry to the game it does.
Cool so there's a benefit to nice I'm not sure they're really particularly happy like give me free entry I feel like and I feel of you I've got that sort of.
Moment of what is it where you have a imposter saying yes I need to ask you I feel a bit bad about it but I asked him the league game is media past miss all point of it so I'm generating media for them.
I have two questions I have two questions for you sure first question is did you receive satisfactory answers to your own questions.
I did to a point so I tried to cardboard I tried to ask a strategy question of the Southeast Melbourne Phoenix coach he and I have encountered each other.
In the past a couple of times via zoom and we have.
We have shared a joke or two over Twitter over the time. Now whether he remembers any of that, I have no idea. Although he did seem to acknowledge who I was.
This is the other team though. You're speaking to the other team.
Yeah, this is the opposition. I'm talking to both teams. I'm impartial. And I tried to ask, I put forward my view of his strategy that they implemented to win the game by one point.
And he gave me a game you answer but then as he left the press conference once the official recording it stopped he yelled out I am sure what do you want to do when you know better than that I'm not gonna answer strategy questions.
How to try to represent the fan I had to give it a crack.
So you like one of those analysts on those Apple quarterly earnings calls who asked about future products or something.
What's the next iPhone gonna have in it and they're like come on.
But I had to try it because I am with NBL pocket podcast I am the fan man in the stand that is my role.
And so I asked the question see the journals the professional journals they ask questions about just kind of getting the media grab they just want to get the grabs they can write a boring story about the game.
Boring.
Boring I am representing all the hardcore basketball nerds that want the detailed answers and want the specifics and the like you know so I am there trying to.
Do they they were I'm doing God's work on behalf of the fan.
Indeed and I was was a was an absolute blast and I think about it and I think I've been following watching basketball since 1987 and if you had told little nine year old Andrew that he would be doing this one day.
Nine year at Andrew would be like that's pretty cool and there's no way you have the confidence to do that because you're a shy little kid and look at me now.
You are the fan man in the stand and you mean man in the stand.
That brings me to my second question, given your excitement, were you more excited about free entry to the game or the lanyard itself?
You go right to the heart, don't you Martin? You know me so well.
You know me so well. What was I most excited about?
I'm not wearing the lanyard right now.
I've got to say, it's close, but oh man, there's so many benefits to each.
Lanyard.
It's the lanyard.
It's the lanyard.
Yeah, 100% lanyard.
I thought so because I can just imagine you at any conference or convention be like oh this is a nice lanyard I like this.
Even though it's kind of those ones that lead to that gigantic plastic place card that people have to wear the formal dresses to annual gala dinner that's right but you've got.
The media was it the nice lanyard or is it one of those dumb ones that has the little clippy thing that sits on your neck pad or was it just a nice.
No it's got a train got a clippy thing but I still like it because it's got it's got league brandy so it's got NBL.
On the manual fabric, I like that.
And it's it's a laminated plastic card so I like that but I like it but it's it's the little pivot hook thing that sits on.
I found that the swivel do.
Yeah the swivel do I feel like it was constantly swivel doing to the backside so I was very conscious, very conscious continually flipping it.
So that my head because I'm not actually my lanyard I'm not stealing somebody else's land yet.
Well quick point on that I mean if we did a side by side of actual face and what is on the card it would not be immediately obvious that those were the same two people and.
It has to be said you're talking about so yeah.
I don't think Jason's having a go at your appearance you are actually you embody physically your many personas so at any given time you're a shape shifter.
He was on the sides to Andrew.
Yeah I that photo was taken when I was business Andrew and now I'm basketball Andrew mid-season.
Yeah yeah.
We love basketball Andrew he's like our favorite one for sure.
Constantly dribbling it's great.
Yeah.
Boom shakalaka.
So can I, I guess I will have to ask my second question now, cause there has to be two. I'm
curious who exactly, who do you work for? I don't understand that at all.
What do you mean?
Who is, who, who, why, why are you doing this?
The people of Western Australia, that's who he works for.
Yeah. Like, are you working for the government? Is this for the league? Is this for the podcast?
Is this in terms -. I don't understand who you represent, who - what point of view are you taking?
You're talking about his income, aren't you? Like how does he live?
I was going to say, are you talking about my day job or just as it pertains to MBL?
No, you have - so you have this media badge via who? Who allowed this to happen?
The League. I requested one from the League.
Okay.
Right.
And I said -.
And what was the - what was the process? Like clearly they don't just give these out to anyone.
Or maybe they do. I don't know. But what was the process here? Like, you just said,
"Hey, I want this." And they're like, "Here you go, mate. It's all good." Or like, "What? Why?
Why? Why you?"
Well, I've, we've been working on this podcast for, it's been going for three or four years.
I've been a part of it.
So it's from the podcast that that's your like...
So my badge, my badge says, "Podcaster, NBL podcast." And so to justify the, you know,
I need to use the content right so I can't just so what we do is the questions and the the answers we get from the press we clip into the NBL podcast show and then create a way to have a conversation about it so it is being utilized rather than just being like hey.
Does Joe have one of these fancy badges?
He did last year he didn't he actually didn't bother applying this year so.
No, no, he asked him any strategic questions. That was the problem.
Yeah, I think-
He got booted.
I think there are some personality clashes that come along the way as well.
Joe, you're f*cked out, buddy. We're getting in. We're going to take the other guy. This is your last.
You're the last chance. You're the last chance for NBL Pocket Podcast.
And who knows if they'll keep giving it to me. Like next year, they might be like, "No, we've learned our lesson now."
You're going to have to get a third co-host just so you can get another badge next year. Okay.
But it's a lot of fun and you know whether you have however long it lasts
I've got to make the most of it and I'm doing trying that to do that exactly that as I'm trying to say
Could we get media?
Badges for that. That's my next question is like Macworld. Oh, okay. You think that I reckon with some of our views will
We'll get meta access in no time any do their pride feel like they're calling right now if I weren't in a focus mode
I probably would have gotten the call. Yeah, we could go
Twitter does that offer media media entry to Twitter not interested has a bit of an odd mask about the place doesn't smell good let that sink in.
This this micro camp.
My girl can we completely glazed over micro camp that's the that's the winning convention that's true we did do that so we already have badges really.
Yeah okay stickers stickers on my laptop to prove that I didn't attend in person boo yeah.
The heights of excellence have already been reached.
Well, congratulations on your basketball.
Thank you.
Wheelie Bob.
Thank you.
And we look forward to hearing more basketball talk on the NBL Pocket Podcast.
Yeah, find it on all your favorite podcast catcher.
Is that what we say?
Podcast catcher.
Is that what we?
I don't think anybody says podcast catcher.
It's podcatcher.
Is it?
I'll defer to Martin because he is a PhD in podcasting.
That's true.
Speaking of PhD in podcasting, I know Martin is going to get angry.
It's always a good segue.
Martin, really specific stories podcast, being followed, actively followed by the father of RSS, Dave Weiner.
Pretty cool.
I was chuffed when you shared that.
So, full circle.
That is pretty cool.
I was kind of disappointed.
I went through it.
So that was a screenshot and it was, he screenshot his feeds.
And on that page was really specific stories.
And I was like, you have got to be shitting me.
And so I went through it and I logged into a source and I checked, I scrolled
down, literally there it was, unfortunately the episodes with Andrew Kenyon and Jason
Burke had scrolled off the page.
So they weren't active anymore.
So.
I'm sure that was by no accident.
But Martin, that's amazing.
Although in a major disappointment no no reference to hemispheric views on that subscription list so.
No promotion work.
No what's gonna get us up there is it when we start designing and handing out hemispherical aliens that's what the world's missing.
Yeah that's not bad idea.
That and the fact that that Andrew tweeted it as rss.net as the link so that didn't help either probably.
It's so hard to remember the right URL. But no, I think seriously Martin, that is pretty cool. You're getting there.
Thank you.
The growth. We're all growing in our different ways. I've got my basketball, Martin's got his RSS. Jason.
I got nothing.
How you doing over there?
I got nothing. I think I'm shrinking. I think I'm slowly shrinking away from the internet. And I'm kind of happy with that.
(upbeat music)
