That's one thing I've noticed about American people in general. You're much more willing to mix
Things like things that don't generally go together. I noticed this about my dad
I noticed this about American friends. We've had staying with us. You'll just
Get stuff and throw it together and see what happens
Whereas I feel like we in Australia perhaps is the British heritage were much more we follow the rules
You know, the rules are that you don't mix vanilla essence with coke
There's no there's no
Proper way to do that. So you don't do it keep them apart
Whereas Americans just let's just throw a bit of this in and what about a bit of this and let's see how it turns out
I think you might be right Andrew because I mean you like scones, right?
Yeah, and what I'm talking about scones to all American listeners. I'm not talking about
Whatever pancake things you have or what I'm talking about the little British things that you cut in half and put jam and cream on
Andrew would you ever put anything other than jam and/or cream on a scone? Goodness no. There you go
Now I can imagine in the US the fact that they've already called something else a scone and then put other things on it
I don't denigrate that at all. I say kudos to you
Creativity just make it happen. But I think that speaks to the spirit you're talking about. Yeah, I think that rules versus experimentation
They would put peanut butter and chocolate on that within five minutes of being provided. Rules are meant to be burned to the ground
Okay, and that's why we're still a constitutional monarchy and you are not
Now we were talking about stickers briefly before we started
Andrew you've got something in here about stickers on guitars. Is this like sticker cross mayonnaise?
Yes, you may remember in our last episode we were talking about my too cool
Nephew keep calling him a cousin, but he's my nephew
I always get that mixed up because he's older so I think of him more as a cousin than a nephew
But he is in fact my nephew. He is cool and we talked about whacking stickers on mayonnaise guitars
or guitar cases
In the intervening two weeks I have spoken to Alex. I met with him face to face. He was very patient
I actually stood him up for 45 minutes when I was meant to meet him. He hung around
Very kind of him
We were trying to use signal and I think for whatever reason signal messaging wasn't getting through to me. So I blame signal
To not knowing that he was there waiting
It's all that encryption just it's got to get through it. Exactly
I think I was connected to a hotel Wi-Fi network and I think the hotel Wi-Fi was
blocking the signal signal
anyway
mystery for another day
But I caught up with Alex and he brought up the fact that he had listened to the last episode because he was
Mentioned and because he provided our theme music so it was important that he listened
He's now an honorary citizen of our podcast
He told me that
We had talked about putting stickers on guitars. He said no way would I ever put a sticker on my mayonnaise guitar?
Because it is too expensive
Now right that's yeah, the stickers are too expensive for the guitar, you know, they're just too good
You wouldn't want to ruin a sticker with that guitar. Oh, oh, I totally miss I had that backwards
Well, that's how I enjoy saying the guitar was too expensive
Well, I I don't really know but that's how I interpreted it that our stickers were that
Price, you know that that special that you wouldn't ruin it. You wouldn't ruin them with a guitar
They are printed with gold so I can understand that so yes, that's the feedback on that one
But he did say that he would be more than happy to whack a few of them on a guitar case
And he said if I could be provided with some I would whack them on my guitar case. So
We the gauntlet has been thrown down. I think whether he knows it or not
We need to get a hemispheric view sticker on a mayonnaise guitar case. What do you think boys?
We had a sticker giveaway. So there are actually
Potentially people out there that have mayonnaise guitars with stickers on them
But I just want to say thank you to all the people that played the game which was not really a game at all
And got stickers if you didn't get it yet, you probably live outside the United States and it'll be there shortly
I don't know probably a couple of weeks ish to get there
But yeah, they're all mailed out and in the mail and if you don't have it yet, you will have it soon
You have a hot hey, well blog no, absolutely not
Okay
It just seems to be the the method of communication lately, so I thought I would jump into yeah
But no, I don't have one you do though
Hey, we'll blog for the second time. No, I don't have a hey world blog. So I'm still on the free loader plan
Trialing it for a couple of weeks
Oh, is that not a you can't you don't get trial you don't get that until you're paying some money
Yeah, so I just um I I've been taught all this talk on micro blog about hey email
I tried it when it first came out
and really gave it a red-hot go and then I to the I
Decided it wasn't for me, and I even wrote a massive blog post explaining how
you can replicate the hey.com features with
mail or like fast mail in my case and a clever combination of
Sane box and if you're really clever using mail mate and some smart mailbox rules
So to basically replicate the entire experience that blog post has been really good
It's probably my most pop. I don't have stats tracking on it, but I just get a sense that um
It's been like the most popular thing I've ever written
So that's quite fun. I've seen other people talk about it that aren't even affiliated with you in any way
So it definitely got some traction, but nevertheless I tried I've been trying hey again
Because there's been so much talk about it that I thought maybe maybe I'm missing something
Maybe I need to go back and give it another crack and it's kind of fun and it's an exciting approach to email
I've still got a little bit of time on my trial, but
It's not I've got ten days left on my trial
It's encouraging. Just remember there will always be another trial for you in the future. That's right and
And I feel like I get what it's trying to do, but it's a pain in the butt.
Like I'm constantly having to like screen people.
And I know that that's meant to like go down over time as you screen all the
people, but it doesn't work well with mailing lists, for instance.
So you get a different person writing in a mailing list.
And so they get, you have to screen them individually each time.
So it's, so it's more work than.
Yeah.
And just to move around like to get to the next email
Maybe there's a keyboard shortcut that I haven't really discovered yet
But I feel like I'm having to go back to the main inbox view inbox
view and
Then look at another mail. There must be like JK keys or something which I haven't discovered yet
But it just seems cumbersome as pretty as it is
It's just and and it's like a hundred bucks a year, which is about twice as much as I pay for fast mail
And I've got free sandbox for a long time.
So I don't see how that stacks up.
So does this really fall into your hatred for default apps?
Like you just couldn't use mail.
You feel sickened a little bit, you know, repulsed by the thought
of it. I feel too normal if I use a default app.
I'm better than that.
So you don't want to be mainstream.
You want to be... so you're a male hipster?
I'm a clever a clever Mac user and I don't want to just use what everybody else uses
I want to use the power user tool
So you want to walk into your... let's just imagine your mail app is a cafe
You want to see those like long white rectangular subway tiles along the back with that sort of everything served on a wooden board
That's what you want.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah.
I don't want to go and just get like McDonald's for lunch
He doesn't want to use McCafe mail
So that's email apps and the other thing I'll say about email apps is on iOS there is still
not a good email app.
The closest I've got is in terms of power is one called Preside.
It's ridiculously powerful and it is ridiculously ugly.
I was going to say I bet it looks really good.
It looks horrible but you can do anything with it.
It's like mail mate for iOS, but it looks disgusting and you'll get lost in the preferences
menus because you go six layers deep and you're like, "What even was I configuring?
I can't remember.
And now I need to go back out."
But then you go all the way back out, you're like, "Where was I?"
You can't find where you just were.
It's a terrible app, but it's amazingly powerful.
There is nothing...
I was going to say, it sounds like it has just square buttons with no rounding and no
depth perception on the button so it's all just flat squares.
That's what it sounds like.
You've used it.
No one's actually presiding over the design.
You've totally used it.
You've just described that app.
I want to show you a screenshot of this app now because you've nailed it.
Can you include a shot in the show notes Andrew?
I'd be curious to see it.
I think I can, yes.
Then I would.
But on iOS it's a wasteland.
The Fastmail web app, or not, but it's a container, it's an app, but it's really just their web
page is the best mail app on iOS. So I was just gonna say it takes forever to
load because it's kind of like loading a web. Oh so it's like using hay. Yeah.
The modern approach. Hmm. I was just gonna say when it comes to iOS and mail, not
just the mail app but other ones that I've tried as well, some for work, some
at a personal interest, whatever, I can't wrap my head around different takes on
conversation views. Do you know what I'm talking about? It's like emails worked for a while and
yes they were cumbersome, it's not quite as fast as darting backwards and forwards or to and fro
with messaging, but you get it and then suddenly let's smush it all this way and then it's all in
here but then they're separate and then you search it and then I don't know which message is which
and then oh you just keep going down follow the color code I have no idea what is going on and
if I can turn off conversation views I will or am I just stupid?
No, amen brother because it's yeah you've nailed it how do you know which
message you're dealing with and then if I delete am I deleting the entire
conversation or just that message or if I move it to a folder am I moving the
whole conversation or just the... what am I working on here? Yeah I'm the same way
it's stupid. You lose your sense of place and the chronology it's like you know
it was just easier when they were separate. At least I know which stage in the history I'm
looking at. So okay, I'm encouraged that I'm not the only one and that the search continues.
I mean, for both of you, because it sounds like, I mean, I use email and we all have to deal with
it, but I don't know if I have quite the same enthusiasm or passion as you two do with this.
What would be the one thing for each of you that you would absolutely love as the top feature
that's missing or needs to be improved in a mail app on the Mac or iPhone?
I don't think I care about email that much actually. I think it's more that the
the problem is just that everything surrounding email is wrong and
It's the one place where you go where you never get what you actually want
Because you don't get to pick what's in there. So like an RSS app
I picked everything that goes in there, but email you don't and that's just
That's email. So I don't I feel like the quest for the perfect email app is
literally not using email because
Email is the problem not the interface to it. I
guess my killer feature is just don't look ugly and
give me a
Reasonable way to move things around
That's about it
I'm not looking for too much here.
- Yeah, not move equals delete.
- Yeah, not moving from spam to the inbox
and having it be gone forever.
That's a high feature request for me.
But yeah, there's not really a lot that an app,
I think, can do for email.
I think really what everyone wants is email
to be something different, which like,
You know, it was, "Oh, Slack changes email."
No, it didn't, but, you know, email's still there.
So that didn't work.
Now you just have a different mechanism for it.
- I'm just sick of email just being lists of stuff.
And I think that's what I was looking for with Hey,
was just give me something more engaging to deal with.
Yeah, make me feel like I'm talking to,
a bit like what Jason said,
make me feel like I'm communicating with a person,
not just acting on another list.
You know, here's the to, the from, the subject, list, list, list, and then you're nesty and
you've got folders, more lists.
And it's just like, it's just lists upon lists of just blur text that all looks the same.
And that's why I'm excited about this big mail thing, if it ever comes out, because
it seems like they're trying to do something along those lines where they're going to try
and use machine learning to figure out what's a newsletter and all that kind of thing and
present those as webpages rather than emails and present personal
correspondence is more like a letter to a friend kind of thing. That's kind of
what I want. I just want email to be engaging and fun rather than just
blurt. Is the is the is the fast mail app on your phone / main screen like is
Is that where you go for mail on your phone?
It's a nice segue to our home screens conversation.
Yes, I've been looking forward to this.
I think there's much to discuss.
Now just to be clear, listeners, you will be able to find these images linked in the
show notes.
So if you want to, you know, look and comment to yourself and then even tweet or get in
touch with us in the public discord or micro.blog with your own thoughts, that would be much
appreciated.
Also, we, you know, obviously welcome other people's home screens as well, right?
My home screen, first of all, I have to say I am entirely unhappy with my home screen,
but I have been entirely unhappy with it for about, well, when did iOS 14 come out?
Because that's how long I've been unhappy with it.
Oh, boy.
Well, here we go.
First Big Sur, now iOS 14.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can we get Johnny Ive back on the team, please?
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure out these widgets.
I'm trying to find a way to make them work for me.
This home screen is kind of widget heavy because it's actually entirely widgets
so
I've got a draft widget, which I don't really need and I need to change that because I've actually enabled
Double back tap on my phone to create a new draft using the accessibility features
Which is kind of annoying in itself because you would be surprised the amount of times you accidentally double double back tap your phone
To create a new draft. So I don't know why I even say double back tap
Exactly with a twist of lemon
So drafts is there but it probably shouldn't be but I'm also trying to remind myself that I pay for this app and I want
to use it and
It is a really useful way to get stuff started, but I don't use it as much as the nerds
make out that I should so it's kind of like a
Reminder I have the weather the weather there as well. I've been playing with that tried carrot weather for a little while
I don't know why I need the weather because it's always the same in Perth and I've got it on my watch
and
It's kind of unnecessary, but it is a bit of it
It's a bit of a humble brag because look at that 31 degrees mostly sunny
Love 22 high 33 Celsius
Beautiful day, and it's always the same so it's always guaranteed to be exactly 31 degrees even with the high of 33 that you don't reach
Yeah, thereabouts
least for six months of the year
So look that's not great either, but I don't know what I'm doing then I've got fantastic al
Showing me my day that is actually quite useful because I but then it has a replication of the weather
So that's stupid and then I have pocket casts as a widget just because I use
Probably that's my most used app. So I just wanted a big touch target for it
That's kind of why I was there, but then I forget that it's there and I go searching for the app
icon anyway, because I forget
Then what you see underneath that as a bunch of icons that look like I've cleverly placed icons there
That's not it. That is one of those Siri
suggestion
Areas, that's another widget where I am relying on machine learning of my iPhone to just
Put there what I need at any particular time
Is it really wait the bot the bottom eight icons are a widget. They're a widget
Why don't they have a name?
They just don't they're just like
I'm curious. I never know what's gonna be there, but I don't even know what that widgets called so often
It's actually correct. I'm
I'm shook by this Andrew Oh
Siri suggestions app suggestions Wow
Yeah, I thought it would put a border around it though
I know and that's the tricky thing so it looks like you've carefully placed your icons
But I have no that is does that just confuse the hell out of you though because you never know what's gonna be there
It makes it fun
Like a big hat full of apps and every day you just kind of reach your hand in there and grab out eight and hope
That there's good ones, but I can't believe this day like and if I if I change my Wi-Fi network
It'll change or if I'm in a particular location like the trans birth icon was there because I think it was you know
I I'd gotten home from school pickup or something. I'd use the bus
Um, chess is there because I've been playing an awful lot of chess with my brother and
losing.
This changes literally everything in what I was going to ask, because now I don't know
what's real anymore.
Well what's real is the bottom, the dock.
Wait, wait, hold on.
Don't say the names of the apps because I have questions.
Okay, okay.
But go ahead.
That's it.
And I've got, that's my homepage.
My second page has a bunch of other icons which almost functions as a home page and
if I just want actual icons.
And that's it.
Wow.
Yeah, that's very, very interesting.
One of my questions was, wow, you almost have all widgets on your home screen.
You're really into widgets.
Turns out it is all widgets and it just was disguised.
But ironically, I don't really like widgets.
I'm moving beyond the Andy nickname to tease you I think we just have to call you dashboard from now on
That's our you get better
Yeah, I was gonna just ask was you were gonna go through the bottom row dock thing
What is the name of the little asteroid shooting game?
Is it money related can I guess that is it money related that is definitely money related you're talking about yeah the why
That looks like a tree?
No, no, not YNAB.
I know that one.
Oh, okay.
The one that looks like a little asteroid in a crosshairs that you're going to shoot
it out of space.
Oh, that is hilarious.
Would you like to guess what that is?
It's not an asteroid.
It concerns something that was once a colony.
But what would, like, why is it in your dock?
What is going on with this that it's so important to be in the dock?
Jason, it's something...
Just have you heard of a little thing called?
Covid-19. Oh, is it a kovat finder you can scan people to see if they have kovat I
wish
At the moment at the moment anywhere you go in Western Australia. You go into any public location like or a shop or
anything they'll have a QR code at the door and
You're requested to scan the QR code so that if they need to do contact right
This is that track now the tracing thing that never happened anywhere
Same in New South Wales. We have the same thing with our own equivalent state government app works a treat
So it's it's kind of like using using a state sponsored
1984 version of like foursquare
Exactly. Yes, and they chose an icon that makes it look like you've got missiles targeting the Western Australian state
Yeah, that asteroid is Western Australia
That is I thought I thought it might be but I couldn't figure out why you'd be shooting it slash scanning it
But that makes sense now. It's a bit of a big brother icon, isn't it? It's
Yeah
Right now I have a question for you
We've already discovered that you are mr. Dashboard widget and you're living a very precarious life very unexposed
It's unpredictable. I'm not coping myself, but there's not you know, whatever suits you you wouldn't have picked it from me, would you?
No, I'm thinking he's got a spreadsheet for everything, but he's living in the he's just throwing himself in the deep end widget wise
He knows what's going Apple knows best
God, I'm curious to know not only about your color aesthetic like your love for gray
But I wanted to know is it an accidental inclusion to have that foliage in the right-hand side
That was a photo that I took off a front yard. I think it is front yard or backyard
It was one of our yards and there's just yeah, there's a little tree at the bottom a little tree on the side
I just took the photo one day and then I was looking for some sort of non-offensive image that part. I thought I'll do I
Know that foliage is there and it does kind of annoy me but not quite enough to do something about it
Now we need to know because Jason brought this up. How many apps do you have on your phone?
I'm assuming you've gone to settings you've checked general and about this is what we're looking
I'm gonna go get my phone off the charger be right back
Off the charger, you know what? I thought he was gonna say Jason
I thought he was gonna say let me just go and check the printout of the spreadsheet that I've stuck on
Yeah, I thought maybe he just had like a running like like a digital whiteboard in the kitchen that just has a constant tracking chart
That is too funny
Killing me. Welcome back. You checked your you checked your printout of how many apps you have I
I can't I can't get over this mustache. I've been I've been looking at it for
49 minutes and 49 seconds actually and
It's just not working for me
Really it's not working for my wife either
Yeah
I was at the 7-Eleven petrol station today and the guy behind the counter had a moustache
and I was like, yeah.
Applications, oh, 169, geez, wow.
How do you feel about that number?
Are you alright with that?
That's way higher than if you'd asked me.
Are we sure that's correct?
169?
My goodness.
That's ridiculous.
So right here you're looking at the home screen for an iPhone 12 mini for any sense of scale
compared to the XR.
As you can see, there are no widgets. I do have widgets. They're in the, what is traditionally
now called the Today Widget area, whatever way you can have it, to the left of the home
screen. To the right there are other apps which are more work-related. So really, the
one home screen that you're looking at is the collection of apps that I deem either
personally important, the ones that I use the most, or the ones that I find aesthetically
pleasing as icons. There aren't really any folders or anything, but I've tried to generally
categorize them in rows in the way that I think that they might be related. So you can see
there's obviously like a chat or social function on the bottom row. There are news or writing
things, mostly camera on one row, but Maps is a bit of an outlier there. Things to do with time
and then up the top things that have to do with words or knowledge or whatever. Down the bottom,
they're just the ones that I use the most and I find myself obviously often listening to a lot of
of music and podcasts and so on. So that's why they're there. That's my
general statement. Fire away. That does not sound like machine learning at all.
No. Or actually, actually it does sound like machine learning but the machine
learning that everybody thinks machine learning is actually doing by doing
things that make sense instead of just here's an eight random apps in a box
that I'm gonna disappear the border. But that's fantastic. I guess my first
question for you would be how much is the in-app purchase to get the other
half of your clock back? Because I'm willing to donate to that. I have
thought about that Icon. I mean I'm willing to accept it because of the
international aspect to it. In fact I pretty much have that app because of you
too. Because I don't know how you of all people can see that and just
not go cross-eyed because that's just very offensive. It's bad. I'm sorry. It's
really bad. It's like they forgot, it's like they've got the guidelines for
an app, an icon template, but they just forgot to fill it in. I've been
willing to forgive it just because the utility is so good. I have the equivalent
Mac app and I use it for obviously, you know, checking. I mean it's a really good
timezone slider app. Have either of you heard of it or used it before? No. So I have all the
different time zones that are important for me. So it might be you two or occasionally I've followed
stuff from overseas. And the great thing is that with your own time zone there, you can move the
slider and it will just click, like go through a flicker of all the times and adjust it in real
time to show you what time it will be on any given day anywhere else in the world relative to your
own. So I think it's a really cool little utility. What is it trying to visually represent with
half of it being missing is that some like i think they're supposed to be like longitude and latitude
of the world but like the clock why is the hat oh so it's just a it's a half clock half
world thing i think that's the idea oh okay it looks more like yeah like the other half of the
app didn't get built like the skin didn't get put on the frame yeah it's like half a death star or
something yeah okay and why am i trying i'm trying to search it up on the app stores thing
I type the clock. Do you think it comes up? No, it doesn't.
I find that hard to believe that you can't find something in the best search implementation ever
created. No, I just found it. It's the clock by scenes because yeah, 599.
What is you talk is what I'm. Oh, you talk. That is actually a
language app similar to Duolingo, but it's more of a flashcard thing.
Got it. Okay, but it just has options that you I think it doesn't um, you said the third row
uh from the bottom was writing slash content so that changes everything for me because I assumed
that the dw app was some sort of transit related app because it looks like a transit logo to me
Oh, okay. So i'm i'm the only one out of the loop. So what what's a what's a dw?
Andrew go for it
well done it's German news okay got it got it it's like they're I might be
getting the financing wrong or something but it's like their state-sponsored or
national broadcaster / content provider which has translations internationally
it's like an international news service based in and mostly about Germany hmm
okay so it's not like Inkle no Andrew could tell you about that you're an
ankle guy into Andrew? He's big into ankle. For the last two days I've been big into ankle.
He'll be into ankle for the next three and a half days until the trial runs out.
So there's no widgets. You're a widget hater, we know that. I don't like them,
no not on the home screen. You also only... I tried them but I don't like them. You also
only have two dots meaning you either only have like 18 apps installed or you use the
junk drawer as well. I'm assuming you use the junk drawer.
When you say the junk drawer, you mean the app library?
Yes. I also, yes I do, but I, well actually no,
I use Spotlight more. I don't like the app library very much at all. I think it's, I
think the concept is a good one for people who, you know, just want a fun way of checking
out icons in any random order. But yeah, I find the alphabetical list thing is fine.
good but yeah the second page is really a bunch of stuff that I use for work
which I want to be accessible but aren't necessarily things that I would
personally choose to dip in all the time. I like the list in the drawer where you
pull down and then you get the little search and then I think that's quite
nice. The bubble categories now it's just it's it's the reverse problem because we
used to have folders every 100 pages of folders that I would have to make that
never made any sense and now I just have the same thing but I don't even get to say what
they're called or even where an app goes, which is weird. And then your wallpaper, it
looks like it's an old Mac wallpaper. Is that just an inspired by kind of wallpaper or is
that actually an old Mac wallpaper from some OS?
Excellent question. I might be mispronouncing the name because it is a French one but there's
actually a wallpaper package called - it's spelt like "Aquux" or something but I think it's French,
it's like "Aquo" or however you would say it - and someone went to the effort of updating in
higher resolution the old Aqua wallpaper design in various different tints and colors, light and
dark mode, and it also comes with a plugin, if I've used the correct term for how it works,
for a system preferences desktop pane where you can have gradually shifting gradients of colors
based on those linking with light and dark mode.
So I just took the mobile version
and made it match my blue iPhone 12 mini
'cause I like the blue all around.
- Yeah, I've just got two questions
'cause Jason's done a good job,
but why do you have the camera icon there
when there's so many other ways to access the camera?
- Excellent question.
Okay, so generally I will go to the camera
from the lock screen, right?
That's what happens,
I'm swiping to scan a QR code to open service New South Wales for my COVID safe check-in
or I'm taking a photo or video, that's normally how I enter the thing.
However, I used to have the camera app icon removed and maybe it was the muscle memory
of doing all of the tapping of the camera icon before that swipe feature came in even
years ago, I found myself annoyed that something as frequently used as the camera wasn't just
sitting on the home screen.
So I like just having it there.
And on top of that, I occasionally do use what was once a force press, but now the long
press to jump into a particular mode.
So I just like having it there.
And it feels like it has a nice little home next to the photos icon.
One other question.
Why do you not have a full use of your icon rows?
You know, that blank one just sitting there.
Great question.
I did for years.
When iPhone screens became taller.
So what we're talking, I think, iPhone 6 onwards, right?
So I had 3G, 4, and 5.
They had full icons.
6 came in, I continued that habit, but over time, and then particularly switching to the
7 Plus after that, I found it too visually busy.
To me, I lost the concept of the dock at the bottom as this permanent hub for the most
used or the preferred apps.
So that gap just feels a little bit cleaner to me.
It's just more of a, an anal retentive thing.
You need more widgets.
No widgets, widgets to me.
I'm not, here's the thing.
I find widgets quite aesthetically pleasing, like looking at, I mean, I'm not going to
ruin Jason's, but looking at each of your respective home screens, I think they look
great.
You know, you can nitpick about colors or personal preferences amongst any users, but
I find the fact that they rotate and change things to be annoying.
because it's like "I can't find things" or "I'm a little bit panicked or anxious about where things
are" but I just want to open it and see that's where my app icon is. And I find writing on widgets,
whether it's a calendar thing or weather update or podcast or whatever, I find it visually
distracting. It's the same reason that my watch face is entirely blank but for analog arms and
the date. Seriously, I've tried every single watch face and I find all of them visually disappointing
or distracting to the point that I just purge it of everything unnecessary. So this is why you see
a very stock standard layout a la, you know, iOS or iPhone OS 1. Quick side tangent on the watch,
do you use ListView or that weird bubble view? List. Yeah. I use the, like I said,
analog arms only, sorry analog hands, not arms, date I have my most frequently,
Jason's doing funny arms now, I have my most frequently used apps in the dock which I normally
consult and then list view for all the apps. I remember when I first found that on accident
years ago and it was just, it was one of the happiest watchOS days ever that that existed
Because that bubble thing, that's useful at zero.
Does it look visually interesting?
Sure.
Nice animations, but no, not practical.
OK.
I've currently got the bubbles.
I used to have list.
That sounds like something a machine learning guy would do.
He'd use the bubbles.
But it is a pain, because I can never find anything.
I might have to actually include this in the show notes.
I'll send you both a picture.
One day, I had the perfect number
of apps in that bubble view, right?
To make the big X like the Roman numeral 10.
And that was what I had as my app layout.
I made a gigantic Roman numeral 10.
- Wow. - I had time back then.
- That's committed. - Yeah, I was gonna say,
that was, you really had a lot going on back then.
(laughing)
- And you can be sure I showed Natasha
and she went, "Congratulations."
- Three hours of your life, you never getting back.
(laughing)
- And then he promptly switched to list view.
- There you go.
And it probably blows it away, right?
If you go back to bubble view,
just like go back to the default.
I'm not saving that work you did, no.
- No, never.
Not gonna happen.
- Yeah, I am so over the app layout of iOS.
It's, you know, it's utility at this point.
it does a thing.
It's just so maddening that again, like since iOS one,
that it's just top left,
fill it in all the way down to bottom right.
And that's the only option.
I think the widgets are neat.
I like them.
I feel like they take up just so much space
that you just can't fit a lot of them,
which I feel like that makes them less useful than,
where I can fit four apps, I can fit one widget, right?
So it's like a four to one trade.
And that really becomes a steep price
when you're trying to lay these things out.
But I've got three of them kind of scattered around,
mostly just to make it a little bit visually different
from how it's been for the last 87 years.
A lot of stock apps, Andrew.
- Yeah, it's a lot of stock apps in there.
- I think Andrew probably thought I got a new phone
just send him a screenshot of a phone right out of the box.
With the build app.
Yeah.
Don't worry, the tips app is right on the next page.
Yeah, mostly stock stuff.
And I think, what is there?
One, two, three, four, four or five apps that aren't stock apps.
Because I mean, a lot of the stock apps, they just, they do what I need them to do.
So I know this is going to be an issue for some.
But yeah, do your worst.
It's pretty boring actually.
You would think that I would have some kind of fancy...
I think there's plenty to comment on here.
Oh no.
Okay.
But Andrew can go first because I think he's...
Like you brought up the stock app situation.
Do you want to go for it?
Well yeah, a couple of things.
I'll tip.
I hope you didn't forget Robin Buell's birthday.
Happy birthday Robin.
The first thing I noticed is your dock.
Okay.
Your defaults you've got mail you got Safari you got messages. We've seen them all a million times before
If you're crafting there, are you you've really?
Digging into craft. Are you are you a paying customer? I am. Yeah, I am a heart heart-shaped eyes emoji user
Yeah, and I can tell you why you want you want the quick the quick version. Here's the quick version
It does the it ticks the four boxes that I have for most
applications.
No, well, one of them's writing specific.
So Markdown support.
Okay.
Big one.
Got to have that.
Um, notes just doesn't have that.
And it's not so much an issue that it doesn't, um, support it in, in the sense that it won't
show you anything visually for note.
I'm talking about the note, just the Apple notes app.
That's fine.
I don't care.
I mean, kind of the point of Markdown is that there's no visual indication anyway, right?
It's just, when I see two underscores, I know what that means.
When I see a hash sign, I know what that is.
That's kind of the point of Markdown.
But it'll just put like random fonts when you paste into notes and things will be different
sizes and then I'm always having to select everything and then go reset the size.
Anyway, this is not to bash on notes, but Kraft supports Markdown beautifully.
So that's box number one.
Box number two is sharing.
I like when things are able to share out in various ways,
whether that be sharing in a shared document like we have,
or just take this thing, turn it into a PDF,
or turn it into something that I can send somewhere.
It's beautiful.
I call it whatever, superficial, whatever.
I like apps that look nice.
That's just something I, you know, a lot of,
There's a lot of really popular notes apps right now
that I just, visually I can't look at them.
And that's, like it sounds like snobby or whatever,
but I just, if I'm gonna be using something,
I want it to look nice.
And then data portability.
This has become ever increasingly important in my life.
If I put something into something,
it better be twice as easy or at least as easy
to get out as it is to put in.
And so many apps are not that.
you put stuff in, good luck ever getting it out
other than copy and paste.
- Yeah, I wanna find a reason to use craft,
but I can't find it.
- That's the other thing about craft for me
is a lot of the notes apps that people talk about,
like, you know, there's insert the list
that everybody goes on about right now.
That's always seems to be the thing
is they wanna find a reason to use it.
Whereas I feel like craft was kind of the opposite for me
where it filled in for a lot of things
that I wanted to accomplish
that I just didn't know were possible.
Craft to me feels like what I envisioned in my head
when I first heard about Notion last year.
This is what I thought in my head.
I was like, that sounds amazing.
Then I used Notion and was horribly disappointed.
And so this is just, this is it.
This is really, really good.
I'm sure a year from now,
maybe it'll be something different.
But again, data portability,
so the cost of getting out is really not that bad.
I just select everything and say export as text bundle,
boom, all my notes are exported
and I can put them somewhere.
- And you're also using Timeler to track your time.
This is an app I'm aware of
because I tried using it for a little while,
but I fell off the bandwagon
and I didn't have the hardware cube
that they will sell you as well.
- Yeah, so timing apps,
I like tracking time for specific things,
but I have one very specific requirement
for a time tracking app,
and I've only ever found of the hundred that exist,
only two have ever done the thing that I prefer.
I don't wanna just click a little play button
and have a counter start going up.
I don't care about that.
I don't need counting down to the second or minute.
I want calendar view, where I just have a calendar
and I visually drag a block of two hours
and say what it was.
Drag a block of an hour, say what it was.
Then I can do everything from yesterday,
'cause I remember what it was,
or I can plan out tomorrow,
'cause I know I'm gonna be doing,
like I'm gonna be doing this podcast
from five to seven or whatever.
I can just drag a block in there
and then go and edit it later.
But so many of them are really more based around billing
and just a bunch of stuff that I don't need.
And Time Mealer does just that.
And they also have the hardware thing, like you said,
which funny enough, I bought,
but Valerie actually uses it for work.
So she has different sides for doing various parts of her job.
And then you just kind of flip the cube from side to side.
And it seemed like a gimmick when I first saw it.
I totally admit that.
But after seeing her use it and using it myself a bit, it's actually quite a good
way to do it versus having to remember and go and toggle an app to change to
different things.
This is just a nice, it's a nice looking thing on your desk.
And it's a visual indicator that,
oh, I'm doing a different thing,
flip it over to that side
and I'm off to the next tracking item.
But yeah, I like it.
- Okay.
Other than that, your iPhone is horribly boring.
- Yeah, I think so.
- Martin, what have you got?
- Couple of observations and questions.
First of all, an observation,
I think linking beautifully to our earlier discussion
in the last episode about the US and Amazon,
the company, not the rainforest.
The fact that you have a delivery app
on your front home screen could not be worlds apart.
I think I receive one delivery per year.
Often it's a surprise.
So yeah, that's amazing.
And I'm not saying it to denigrate you.
I just think it's just a huge sign of a cultural difference.
- It's actually gone now, now that you say that.
Since the whole Amazon thing happened and all of that,
it's actually not on there anymore because-
- Oh, so this is out of date.
- Yeah, it's been empty.
The app, Deliveries is the best app for tracking anything,
at least in the US,
but it's been empty for a very long time.
Well, very long time,
like about the last month has been very, very empty.
So I actually did move it into a widget stack
that if I put a package in there,
I can just kind of swipe down, check on it,
and then swipe away, but that's actually gone now.
Um, good question.
Just for the sake of current affairs.
It's Discord is there now.
Okay, that's fine.
That's self-explanatory.
Okay.
Because I kept, I got really tired of going to, so much stuff is happening in Discord
all the time that I was always going to page two to get to it, but nothing on page one
was ready to let go of its spot until now.
Just as incidentally, deliveries doesn't work well in Australia, but we have a Australian
version, a ripoff version. It's called Parcel. I have a question about your photos arrangement.
Okay, so you've got the photos app icon. Makes sense. That's where you go to look at your photos.
But then you've also got the photos widget. Now I'm assuming that's because you've said,
ah, phone's boring, or it's just a bit of a utilitarian interface. I want to freshen up a bit.
So I assume the photos there to spice things up. So that's fine. You've got two ways to get to the
app. My question for you though is that, you know, I've used that widget before as a test and then
put it away because while it was visually interesting, inevitably a photo would appear
that I absolutely did not want on the home screen, either because it didn't fit or something was
cropped not exactly right, or it was a person from the past who I really just didn't want,
I don't know why their face was on my home screen all of a sudden. So how do you deal with that?
That's my question, because today it's a flower. That's lovely. But suddenly,
another time, it's a picture of a delivery you received.
Yeah, no, I really, I really, really like the photos widget when it works correctly,
in the sense that it's showing me just things from the past, because we have so many,
I mean, what I've got 40, 40, not now 50,434 images in photos, the likelihood of me randomly
stumbling upon something in there is pretty dang low.
So I really like that this just says like,
"Hey, here was a thing from 2007."
And it's like, "Oh wow, I totally forgot about that."
The number of times something's come up in this photo widget
that was very interesting to me and surprising
and made me happy to see that thing again,
far outweighs, like you said,
sometimes stuff does show up where I'm like,
"That shouldn't be in there."
Fortunately, you can go in and just say like,
"Hey, never recommend this to me ever."
And it won't do that.
We're back into kind of manually doing things again,
but at least it's possible.
The only reason I have photos also
is because when you tap the photo in the widget,
it goes to that specific photo.
And then I have to hit the back button
to go back to the, now I'm in For You.
Then I have to hit Library,
and then I have to scroll down to the bottom
to get to like what was recent.
So the photos app is there because that brings me right
to the very bottom of my all photos.
So I'm just trying to find like something recently.
- I have to say, this is amazing.
I think this has probably revealed just as much,
if not more than the desk episodes.
I am flabbergasted.
I mean, both of you accept things on your home screens
that you did not choose.
I can't do that.
Now I can see that the Trello cards are editing themselves.
So we should maybe in the interest of time
(laughs)
find out how many applications,
how many applications do you have?
- Oh, Martin, yeah, what was yours?
- Oh yes, 76.
- Oh my God, 76.
The dream, you win.
- I win?
- Yeah.
I've tried to get below a hundred so many times
and I just can't do it.
I have, I still, I'm starting to turn around
and I don't know what this condition is called that I have,
where there's the, I haven't used this app
in four and a half years, but what if?
You know, like half, probably over half,
probably three quarters of the apps on my phone
fall into the category of, haven't used in,
don't know how long, but what if I need it?
Which is just the worst, I honestly wish I could
somehow reliably hand my phone to someone,
maybe this is a service we can provide,
hand your phone to us, we'll go through,
delete a bunch of crap to get you down
to a reasonable number of apps,
and then hand your phone back
and you just accept what has happened.
Obviously we're not gonna delete things
that are perceived important or maybe on your home screen,
but we're gonna go through that app drawer,
we're gonna just start hacking and slashing away.
We're gonna get you down to like a 75 range,
which is respectable like Martin versus someone like me.
That's at 218.
- Ooh. - Wow.
- Did you know that phones could even hold that many apps?
Where are they storing them?
- How heavy is your phone?
- It's so heavy.
That's the thing.
I've got the iPhone mini and it's four pounds.
- And just a reminder to all listeners,
we'd love to see yours.
So tweet it @hemisphericv,
share it on micro.blog @hemisphericviews
or to any of the three of us.
The best way on top of that
is really to join the public Discord if you haven't already
because then you can share it
with other like-minded home screeners
and we can discuss it more.
So, very good.
- Yeah, we can post them in there too probably
'cause then you can kind of reply to the screenshot.
- That's a good idea. - Yeah.
Yeah, we'll do that.
(upbeat music)
