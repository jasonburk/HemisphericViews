This time we welcome two special guests: Hannah gives a detailed review of the Remarkable 2, a premium handwriting tablet; and Natasha explains an awesome set of games within a game, which amazingly scale from Apple Watch to iPad. Meanwhile, the guys thank the initial group of *One Prime Plus* supporters and Martin disappears to care for Mac mini.
