[Music]
And how is it that you've changed your podcast setup, Andrew? Enlighten us.
I have added another person to the mix.
So we're joined here by a wonderful lady.
I'll let her introduce herself.
I'm Hannah.
I'm Andrew's wife.
Hannah, do you guys do use surnames?
It's a giant, giant mystery.
It's a giant mystery.
Okay, well, I'll just keep it.
But no, you can use a surname.
They know it.
Okay.
So yeah, I'm your wife, Hannah Beasley.
It's a good thing you're a generalist.
You're worldwide famous already.
So already you're more famous than we are.
So everybody knows who you are.
No, no.
Well, Andrew keeps on telling me about like all of your podcast stuff.
I'm like, "Oh, I'm not sure I'm famous enough."
I'm like, "Oh, I'm not sure I'm famous enough."
you're more famous than we are so everybody knows who you are. No, no, well
Andrew keeps on telling me about like all of your podcast listeners and your
Patreon people so I don't think that's actually the case. So many, so many
listeners and yes Patreon as well now which has been quite quite interesting
and fun to do actually to have Patreon and so much easier for people to just to
go one place and get all the bonus stuff and not have to figure out where to buy
coffees and where to buy this, where to buy that. We do have actually some new
supporters this week that you mentioned it. Thank you for the wonderful segue.
Three new global supporters. Global. They couldn't decide if North or South was
the way to go so they took the correct path and went global. We've got Andrew R.
We've got some Gene M and some Eric W for anonymity's sake. And we also, I don't
know why, don't ask me, I couldn't make this up. Somebody actually went above and
beyond to the "take my money" level which is just mind-blowing. Why would you do
that? Because you get the exact same stuff. But yet Gabriel S said, "You know
what? I believe in this. I really want this to go further. Take my money." So
thank you all again to the global supporters as well as the "take my money"
supporters we appreciate all of you if you are not already a supporter and want
to be you can now go to one prime plus dot-com and it'll take you right there
easy that's incredible we have our own domain name we have a lot of domain
names patreon package we were gonna have a much funnier domain name actually I've
I've been going back and forth on this,
and we initially were going to have
one prime dot plus slash net dot com dot au
was initially gonna be the domain,
so it would be really easy and rememberable.
Problem is, apparently, living in the United States,
I am not allowed to purchase a .com.au domain,
therefore ruining my joke.
So I'm a little upset about that,
but we have one prime plus.com.
So, you know, compromise.
- Very good.
And before we leave that Patreon point,
as a one-off, let's call this a marketing strategy.
Is that what this is?
It's a marketing strategy.
As a one-off, we're gonna open up the first edition
of our hemispheric news PDF newsletter,
where you can find the most unbelievable tips, tricks,
personal stories from each of your three co-hosts here.
Once a month through One Prime Plus,
we're gonna open it up as a bit of a tester
in the show notes you'll find linked there.
And if you like it, consider signing up
and you'll get that delivered every month.
I think that's a nice marketing strategy.
Andrew, be proud. - Yeah, yeah.
That's right.
They always say in most of the good businesses,
it's like your first hits free,
after that you gotta pay.
So we're taking the same approach.
first hit of the hemispheric news all yours take it you want number two pay up
I'm concerned that you've compared us to a business in which the first hit is
free but that's okay I'll take it I'll take it
should we talk about why Hannah has joined us today please do all right so
So Hannah has recently moved into a new job.
Job being a politician, parliamentarian.
A job where you speak with a lot of people a lot of the time and you're taking copious
notes.
You, me, most of the Hemisphere Reviews people would probably use record, like keyboards,
but not Hannah.
She's a handwriting kind of person.
And so I thought a nice gift as sort of like a congratulations, well done, you made it
gift would be, I bought Hannah.
Oh, I didn't, it wasn't I bought, we bought.
Right, Jason?
Jason with a generous little contribution bought Hannah a remarkable two.
Well, much like the domain I wasn't allowed to buy, apparently I'm not allowed to vote
in Australia either. So I'm just feeling really shut down. So I had to, I had to donate somehow.
And you've watched her opening speech, I think as well. So.
Yeah. And now that you mentioned it, it's in the show notes, so everyone else can watch
it as well. It was awesome. It was, it was really good. No, no BS. It was, it was legitimately
good and I actually watched the whole thing all the way through.
Well, I'm impressed because that was a half an hour of your life you're never getting
back. So well done you. Thank you.
So many half an hour's of my life I'm never getting back, trust me.
This one was actually worth it.
That was the best half hour you're not going to get back.
You should see how long it took me trying to get a .com.au address.
Well I'm super nervous about being on here I've got to say.
This is like a really big thing.
The thing in our household is Hemispheric Views.
We know all about you.
Your guys' reputation precedes you.
And in full disclosure, I've had a glass and a half of red wine to calm my nerves.
So I know I'm a bit of a Cadbury kid, so I'm a little bit nervous about that.
So I'll try and get through the remarkable review with my one and a half glasses of red
wine.
That's the only way to do reviews as far as I'm concerned.
You should see once I get this new iMac, four glasses of wine, easy.
Have you prepared questions for Hannah or should she just launch into her review?
I had a couple questions, not directly related, but just this kind of table stakes questions.
The first one being, do you currently use anything like an iPad or other tablet-y type
thing to do digital handwriting?
No.
So, no, not to do digital handwriting.
So I've taken pretty much all of my notes on my laptop with meetings or what have you.
Or when I'm meeting with constituents and this actually drives Andrew nuts, I just open
up Simple Note on my iPhone to do it.
Wow.
Simple Note.
Nice.
I don't know.
Apparently it's not that great.
I get shamed for it consistently.
I don't think we've ever actually covered SimpleNote at all.
So that's okay.
Perfect.
So no previous digital handwriting.
Good to know.
I'm assuming lots of regular handwriting on, you know, good old sheet of A4 or something
like that.
I write a lot of handwritten notes.
So every meeting I go to, every phone call, what have you, always written down handwritten
notes.
At any given time, I've got two to three notebooks in my handbag because it can't just be one
because there are varying levels of importance depending on like meetings, then you know,
to do's, then phone calls.
And then the trouble with that though is you've got at least three different notepads.
I work from home, I work from my community office, I work from Parliament House and then
I work on the road with various stakeholders.
So nothing stays in one place.
Everything has to be carried.
And everything is on various quality levels depending on the quality of notes.
Do those handwritten notes get translated into digital form by taking a picture of them
and archiving them?
Do you hand type them later or do they just get chucked in the bin?
So sometimes they get sort of translated into an email for somebody else to do as I delegate.
Other times in the not so important or the like transitional casual notes, which tend
to be meeting notes with a constituent that have to get a staff member to follow up, it
will be on a piece of paper from a notepad that I can rip off and then give to the staff
member and say, this is what this meeting was about.
You go follow up.
completely from my level, like I don't need it in my life anymore, but you've got to go
do this for that.
So, very levels, but things that are for myself are on like good quality paper with a good
quality pen that I go and refer to often.
Okay.
Final question before I actually let you continue with what you were starting with.
What percentage would you say of each individual piece of paper consists of actual information
verse doodles because you couldn't be bothered to listen to what this person was saying.
Theoretically, let's just say theoretically, obviously everything's important, but...
It's the old 80/20 rule.
Ah, okay.
So, yeah, but like to be fair, it's actually 80% content, 20% doodles rather than the other
way around.
Oh, okay, good.
I'm glad you clarified that because I was going 20%, 80% doodle, but okay, love it.
All right.
that's it to set the... Well, what did we get first of all? What's the... This is the Remarkable 2,
right? And I'm unfamiliar with the buying flow for this. Is there just one Remarkable 2? What's the...
What does that look like? Yeah, I should probably clarify here, seeing as I was the one responsible
for the purchasing. It was the Remarkable 2, which is the only device... I don't think you
can get the Remarkable 1 anymore. I think it's just the 2. So we have the 2. Then we went with
They give you two options of stylus.
I went with the one that's the premium model that has the eraser on the end of it.
So you can flip it around and use it like an old-fashioned pencil.
You rub that on the screen and it acts as an eraser.
I also went for the folio cover, I think they call it.
Not in the leather, because my pockets weren't that deep.
But it's the book approach, like it opens like a book cover, rather than being a slide-in
case.
So we've gone relatively premium, no expense spared on the device itself or the devices,
a little bit of expense spared on the case.
Okay, so there's one device and then some accessory choices.
Correct.
Okay, so my highlight is I absolutely love it.
So there you go.
Perfect.
10 out of 10, done.
Apart from jewelry, the most successful gift Andrew has ever given me.
Yeah, no, I absolutely love it.
I've gone from at least three notebooks to just the remarkable
in a week, which I never ever thought would happen.
I am a prolific note taker that, like I said,
that has very specific needs with every notebook.
And I just, I love it.
So I've got notebooks set up for my constituent meetings.
I've got notebooks set up for my meetings.
I've got notebooks set up for Parliament House.
There's quick notes for just things I need to jot
at any given time.
And then there's different, oh, I'll get into it,
but there's different templates.
I've got template for to-dos.
It's, I love it.
Most importantly for me,
it is incredibly nice to write with.
Like I feel like I'm actually writing,
which is why I think I had an iPad maybe for a year
before it went on to one of our kids
when they were old enough,
because I never liked using the pencil on a screen
or my finger on the screen.
I used an iPad for YouTube and emails
and internet viewing and messaging and things like that.
But for me, that's a laptop, that's not an iPad.
- I'm great at being a computer,
not at being a piece of paper.
- Yeah, exactly.
And then, but this is like,
it's a digital piece of paper
that I never thought would feel like a piece of paper.
And it's not just like the writing mechanism
that feels really nice and natural,
but it's the actual,
whatever tactile element they have created
between the pencil and the screen,
it has a real scribble effect
that makes you really feel like you are etching
on a piece of paper.
- And what about the sound of it, if I can butt in there,
how does it sound to write on?
- It sounds like a really light scribble.
When you're in a meeting and everyone's talking,
you don't tend to hear it at all,
but you sort of feel, it's gonna sound really weird,
but you feel the sound of it doing it.
But when I've, like I've written letters on it
with nobody else around.
So I've just noted letters that I then send to my staff
and say, "Can you please send this letter to this person?"
God, I sound like a 1950s manager, but it's-
- Get on the teletype.
- Yeah, because I actually want to,
'cause I think better when I'm writing in full
rather than tapping in front of the computer.
And so when I wanna be personal on a letter
and actually think about it and be empathetic with people,
I need to be able to write it.
And it does that like perfectly.
So, and you can hear it when you're writing in silence
and it's super satisfying.
It's really, really satisfying.
And I'm also really particular about the pens that I use
usually on a notepad, on a physical notepad.
And there's been-
- You fit in so well here, you don't even realize,
like this is just-
- Agreed, yeah.
- Yeah, and I haven't been missing anything,
not using a physical pen.
Probably to be fair, the only thing that I miss is that I write in color in Notepad.
So I take around a little pencil case with me and I've got a purple pen, a green pen,
a blue pen, a black pen, and they've all in my mind are coded differently, those different
colors.
So that's probably the only thing that I miss, but by the same token, and that's a really
big thing for me because it's how I've operated since high school. But it's such a pleasure
to write on and such a convenience that I'm like I'm happily giving that up rather than
begrudgingly giving that up.
I'm assuming it feels more like a pencil than a pen.
Definitely, definitely feels more like a pencil, which in this case is kind of more satisfying
because a pen on a, on a digital screen just wouldn't give you the same tactile satisfaction.
But yeah, really, really good. And the note to text function, I think it will get better
with time, like note to, you know, typed text. I think it would get better with time. And
I have really at times very hard to decipher handwriting because I'm so used to handwriting
and only I need to interpret it,
it has gotten very short-handy with time.
And it's picked it up really well.
And there's only been,
like I wrote a three-page letter the other day
and there was only, I think, yeah,
three words in that that I needed to correct.
- Wow.
- Yeah, which considering-
- Is that what you use with-
- Sorry?
- Is that what you use with colleagues and so forth,
is you'll handwrite it, convert it to typed text
and then send that, I'm assuming, instead of, yeah.
Exactly. Yeah. Which also my staff is super, super pleased about because they've spent the last two months trying to decipher my handwriting and it's very much slowed productivity.
So they are all for it.
What a great change. I have a question for you.
You've really sold the whole actual writing act, the feel of it, the sound of it.
The note to text thing is pretty amazing.
The fact that you had to do three words.
What I'm interested in is, as someone who likes to use the iPad for some writing, but
also for audio editing for this very podcast occasionally, writing long form stuff for
research, doing internet browsing, I enjoy aspects of that device because it can be many,
many different things.
This is inherently a very focused product, but there has to be a range of computer-related
things in it to turn things into PDFs or emails or whatever.
How do you find the interaction with the more computer elements of the interface away from
writing with the pencil?
It's not as natural.
It's definitely not as natural as writing with a pencil, but it's completely more than
workable.
So, for instance, before we came on tonight, like I've only had it for a week, so I hadn't
needed to import anything to it.
But I just for testing purposes, I thought what I'd mostly import into this would be
PDFs that I would then go and notate because there's a lot of that and when
you're dealing with legislation there's a lot of PDFs to go through. So I
imported a very heavy PDF document that I worked on about a year ago and it was
very, it had a lot of text and it had a lot of images and this is, it's a
notebook, it's only like black and white, I don't know what, I don't know. Many shades of grey. Many shades of grey, there we go. I thought it was a technical word term for it but that's fine.
And so I thought I'll 50 shades of gray. I think is let's not so I imported that one going
This is gonna be a really heavy document and let's see how quickly it renders and how
You know
I can zoom in which is a new feature the remarkable to being able to do like an iPad
two finger zoom in and so did all that and
It was definitely not as fast as an iPad zooming in because you've got to you know, re-render a text page
but it was you know, I blinked and it was done it just wasn't done before I was blinking and
Really simple to use and then notating over the top of the PDF was
Brilliant. So I was really impressed with that because I was actually expecting it to turn downwards at that point
And considering most of the PDFs that I deal with are actually all text these days
no images and no what have you. Super easy, like super, super easy. And actually, unless you have
a iPad or a Mac book, unfortunately, I don't know if it's the same in America, but in Australia,
actually most laptops or whatever that you were given these days are Microsoft based ones. So
you can't, there's nothing native to it where you can adjust PDFs. So, you know, getting the Adobe
program to be able to write over a PDF or whatever, it costs your employer $200 a pop
or whatever and they're never going to do it.
And that's actually what's provided to us in our jobs now.
So this means that I can do all that without having to worry about it.
And usually most of the time you want to be able to notate over a PDF, have your answers,
your questions answered and you're done.
For the PDF stuff, is it pretty much a one-to-one page wise?
Because the device looks pretty big, like a pretty normal size piece of paper.
So for PDFs, you get a pretty good rendition of one to one, would you say?
Yeah.
So it's more like, so the actual size of the remarkable two paper would be much more than
two thirds.
I'd say, I don't know, six, eight.
Oh, that's two thirds, isn't it?
Roughly about that.
Maths was always my strength point.
It's three quarters, isn't it?
So it's, and the, what I, what I imported today as well was a landscape PDF.
So I did have to turn the remarkable in order for it to fit appropriately.
But it was then really intuitive, like, you know, going through my pages, turning off
the menu so I could see the full page, being able to write over the top of it.
Like, yeah, really, like, I really thought that that was, I was like, I'm going to do
this, I'm going to make it, I'm going to make it work really hard.
And I'll have a negative thing to say to him as far as it is, and I'll be balanced in my
reporting.
But yeah, really liked it.
- Okay, that answers my last question of what's,
if there was one thing that you don't like about it,
but it sounds like maybe just it could be slightly faster,
but even that doesn't really seem like that big of a deal
at this point.
- Slightly faster.
You could not get colors on this thing,
which would be my absolute ideal.
And not even colors in rendering a PDF,
but colors in the pens and pencils that you use.
that would be my absolute ideal.
No, like apart from that, from what I need it for,
like if you used an iPad for your graphics
and for your editing of podcasts and things like that,
not like this isn't for you,
but if you wanna replace a analog notebook
for a digital notebook and have it do everything
that you need to do, it's brilliant.
Like I went to a meeting today
and I didn't have the car today, so I Ubered it.
And all I took was my rebarcable and my phone.
And as a human being, but particularly as a woman,
I usually have an incredibly big bag with me
wherever I go.
And it was like the most liberating thing in the world
that all I took was a digital notepad and a phone.
Like I felt like a man.
I felt like, oh, this is what men do all the time
without any bags.
- You could have spread out on public transport
as much as you like. - I know, seriously.
I was like, this is a moment of gender equality
right now. Thank you to the remarkable. I have one more question, actually, if you don't mind,
you noted colors before. Look, I mean, thinking back to the monochrome environment that was the
Macintosh, I think some people actually were very nostalgic and didn't like when it went color. But
I noticed when you were talking about the colors of pens that you used, you didn't mention red.
Now, Jason, I'm pretty sure you know me as someone who would use a red pen. If in an analog
environment. I see Jason's holding up a red pen. This is my Martin pen. Martin pen. Do
you not use red pen? It's not a big deal, but is that not part of your palette? No,
I do, except I have been known with staff members over time to use red pen a little
bit too much on other people's work. Yes. So when I do it for myself, I try not to do
but I'm commonly sent messages from former team members who could probably do with a few more
writers in their group and I just get this message saying "we miss your red pen" and that's all I get.
So I am both proud and traumatized by the red pen effect so I try not to use it too much.
I'm very encouraged by that. So do we have a scale in terms of reviews? I don't know if we've done
that before on Hemispheric Views, a scale to actually review a product. Are we doing that?
We do, it's very official. It's number of globes per device divided by three and then multiplied
by the number of people on the show. Pretty simple.
So Hannah, how many globes?
Like I said, math is not my forte and I just had another sip of wine,
so I'm absolutely not the person to ask.
I think it might be an entire or many, many globes.
Okay, many. Yeah, so 20. I would it sounds like it's about 2829 globes, if I get all of the universe.
So 2028 and a half globes out of the universe. That is pretty remarkable.
Oh, to say, Wow, that's pretty remarkable, too.
Wow, I actually actually had more questions now that we've already rated it, but that's
The one guy who isn't a dad on the show is nailing all the dad jokes tonight.
I am 100% dad joke in spirit.
I just want to say that in terms of this, if I can just make a point here, this is the
first device that I have not had a chance to play with.
I have not used it.
It's kind of killing me.
I'm dying a little on the inside.
- That's probably the best review, honestly,
is that it didn't end up in a drawer after three days,
like a lot of the crap that we buy.
So I think that alone, and the fact that,
I think the thing with this is if I bought a Remarkable 2,
I want one, just because it's cool, I would buy it,
I would use it for about eight minutes,
and then it would just kind of sit somewhere, right?
Because I don't have the,
I'm not in the situation that this is made for,
And it sounds like this is exactly made for you and the kind of work and interaction you
have day to day where I'll do some handwritten stuff, but in general, couldn't be bothered.
And I don't miss that at all.
But it sounds like this is the kind of device that is purpose built and that's why it does
what it does.
But if you buy it thinking it's going to be your iPad replacement or it's going to replace
your whole, normally you type a thousand words a minute and it's going to replace that.
It's not.
But this is one of the rare chances where I think a piece of technology was built, purchased,
and delivered to the exact intended audience.
And that's, I think, what we're seeing here.
Because if I were to review it, I would probably have a much different perspective of, "Oh,
it doesn't, you know, import this weird, super weird formatted file that I use for some crap
that everybody else in the world is like, I don't care.
So that's awesome.
I'm really happy to hear that.
And I am stoked.
I feel like this is like, I've lived in a world of devices for 20 odd years now.
And I think that this is like the first device that was made for me.
And I absolutely love it.
I am super stoked.
So there's a couple of things.
Well, there's one thing I would say I think some other people might find not great is that there's a tiny little power button on
The top of the remarkable that's fine. That's not what could be great or not great if you had an opinion about that
Well, you guys probably would but I don't
It's fine
But what I actually really like about it is when I open up the folio
It's the the little sign is remarkable is sleeping and I have to press the button to wake it up
Now I actually really like that and I think it's probably for people like me who would then get nervous
If it was actually live at that point because like oh my gosh is something gonna get written on there that I don't want written on
There and what have you so I actually really like that. It's sleeping until I wake it up
So even if the folio is open that doesn't actually wake it up. I have to press the button to wake it up
I suspect other people might find that really annoying
But I actually really like it
But then yeah, so it came with probably, I turned it on, it would have had somewhere
between 25, 30% charge.
So I was like, "All right, I could probably use it for an hour or two."
After an hour, I plugged it in.
I don't know what it was down to after an hour, but it didn't have any warning signs
or what have you, but it's just the point where I knew I had access to a plug and I
plugged it in.
So I plugged it in for maybe two hours while I also continued to work on it.
That was a week ago and it is at, if I turn it on right now, I can tell you what it's
at.
It's at 77%.
Okay.
So definitely multiple days/weeks more than likely.
Yeah.
Definitely.
Kind of an e-book reader situation where they last just to the point where they're so long
that you forget that you have to charge the thing.
Exactly.
Speaking of eBooks, you can import eBooks to this and use it as an eBook reader.
Okay, that's good to know.
I like that.
Final question.
I swear this is the final question, I think I said final question three or four times,
but final question.
Connector for charging USB-C or micro USB?
This is make or break for Jason.
That looks, judging by the eye test, I'd say that's USB-C.
Oh, thank goodness.
And this is with your one eye of vision, correct?
Yeah.
This is still questionable.
I've got a blind eye.
So yeah.
So but it's like it's a USB to USB-C is how you charge it.
USB-A.
USB-A.
Yeah.
Okay.
Good.
Good.
Because if anything comes to my house that's not USB-C at this point, directly in the garbage.
Awesome.
Wow.
the most highly, highly praised thing probably that we've ever talked about ever.
But also probably from the most easily pleased.
Might have something to do with it.
The other thing I would say, and because I'm super excited about this and now I, my
full one and a half glasses of wine in is that, so Andrew got me the remarkable pen that
goes with it, which is excellent, which I actually didn't even realize until tonight.
It was the premium pen. So it actually has the digital eraser on the top of it,
which is super exciting. Cause I've been pressing buttons to erase,
which I thought was really cool. And then it's just got a whole lot cooler.
And you haven't chewed it. Have you? No, um,
that is like sacrilegious to a note taker, but okay. Just checking.
So, but what I would say is what really freaked me out to begin with.
So it's magnetic that I thought that it, um,
Connected kind of like halfway down the notebook and I was super
Disappointed in the first day because I was like that is not a good magnetic connection
It's just gonna come it's gonna come off my notebook in my bag all the time. I've got a million things in my bag
It's gonna get lost
I'm gonna have to carry my pencil case still around with me because it's gonna have to go in my pencil case. I was
disheartened by the idea of this pen falling off and getting lost in my bag or broken.
Then I realized my stupidity and it actually connects that like at the top of the notepad
and it is a super strong magnet. Like I've like brushed up against it a million times.
It's been in my bag throwing around, including in my, in a non-structured handbag,
which does my head in, and it has not fallen off and I love it.
I will be the first to say thank you very much for this, or maybe not thank you,
because now it's like I kind of already wanted something that I don't need and now it's like
it's only been good things all the way down, so now I don't know what to do.
Next episode he'll have one.
Yes, we've increased the cast yet again, so thank you.
you listening. Things just got a lot better looking. Should I leave the room? So right
here we have another partner on the show, this is my beloved Natasha. Why did Hannah leave?
Competition. Competition? She ran away. No. Oh goodness, tell her to come back. She's going to
get more wine. Oh fair enough, that's fine. One glass per person that's added to the show.
So we've just had a wonderful review of The Remarkable Two by Hannah. Natasha has kindly
joined in for the Hemispheric Views experience as well and like Hannah she's bombarded by
my constant jabbering about this show. I think you wanted to do your own review as well,
is that right? Yep. Yeah, okay. So I'm not sure how many people actually have much to
do or much experience with this particular product or whatever you want to call it, but
do you want to introduce yourself properly so I stop jabbering to the listeners? Okay,
Well yes, hello, my name is Natasha Candelas-Feld, wife of Martin.
You can speak naturally, I'm just the formal bastard on this show.
Well I have to match the formality.
Oh no, be yourself.
No, I thought I would talk about the app which is available on the iPhone, Apple Watch and
iPad, I think?
Yeah, yeah, and for context, I mean, I'm normally the one who just bombards her with apps and
games and she normally says, "No, I'm not doing this." Hannah, do you have this experience
that Andrew's recommending things and you go, "Please leave me alone"?
So, so often. So this was actually one of Martin's recommendations. It's an app on the,
like I said, the iPhone, the Apple Watch and the iPad called Arcadia, which is arcade games
for the phone. So essentially I've become obsessed with it since going on maternity
leave. It is very addictive. Essentially 18 games in the one app and they all work. It works across
all three so if you've purchased it on one it just goes on to all your devices which I thought
was really really cool. My favorite game is called Bricko which is essentially a much better version
of Tetris. I've got a really high score which I'm very very proud of but anyway that's not the point.
What is it? 33,000 something. I actually- That sounds super impressive. In the scheme of the
game, it's actually not that good, but I'm very proud of myself. So Bricko is number one,
highly addictive. I probably spend way too much playing it. If I looked at my,
what's it called? The analytics on your phone of how long you spend on a channel. Oh, screen time.
Screen time. Never look at that. So it's always bad news.
always bad news, especially with Bricko. So Bricko is number one on that game, but it also
has things like a pinball machine, kind of like that brick game that was on the iPod,
you know, when you slide the thing and the ball bounces. Oh, that Breakout. Breakout, love some
Breakout. It's got that, there's Snake, for anyone who likes playing Snake on the, like, Nokia.
Love it.
Um, you're a snake person.
Yes.
You've got me now.
Tetris, Tetris.
I was almost there.
Snake.
I'm there.
But to be fair, if you download Snake 97, that is a much better snake app because
it's like a Nokia simulator.
Oh, right.
The best.
It's the best.
When we came to the US Jason, that time we saw you.
I played snake pretty much that whole flight from Sydney to LA.
It's not a joke, I was astounded.
What else do you do with 16 hours?
Exactly.
Normally I sleep really, really well.
And Martin is awake on planes, but it was flipped, so he was dead to the world on the
plane and I played Snake for almost 16 hours.
Wow.
That should be some kind of record by itself.
So I do like my mobile games, but Snake 97 the app is better than Snake on Arcadia.
But still good.
This looks incredible.
I'm looking at it on my phone right now and like the artwork looks great.
All the little games look very...
It's really cute.
So is it all the sort of 80s, 90s games?
It's all the old style stuff?
Yes.
So there's also things like Simon, like the memory game.
Oh yeah.
Things like that.
My number two game is called Treasure Map.
So it's like a four by four grid of puzzle pieces
and you have to arrange them to get the pirate
to the treasure.
And then like the time you do it in gets shorter
and shorter.
So that's, I love playing that one on the watch actually.
My high score is on the watch.
- On the watch?
- Yeah.
- That's the thing that's freaking me out here.
They're all on the watch.
- Yes.
- Wow.
- Bricko and Treasure Map are favorites.
you know, everyone takes their phone to the toilet. Everyone,
like no one can deny that, but having Arcadia,
having Arcadia means you don't have to take your phone.
Cause you can just play on your watch. Bricko, then what did I just say?
Treasure map. My third favorite is, uh,
Tappamole, which is the equivalent of Whackamole.
So good. But to be fair, and Andrew,
you would know this, it does not compare to like Whack-A-Mole in person at time zone.
Oh yeah.
Where you've got the physical thing in one hand, but you've also just using your palm
and you're just smashing the moles all over the place as hard as you can.
Actually, I tend to leave the Whacker like in the holder and just go with my hands until
their red raw. I take it very seriously so I can get as many tokens as possible.
Yeah, totally. But so, Tapper Mole on Arcadia is almost as fun. As much fun as you can have
tapping a phone. I still am just blown away that this is on the, that it scales from watch to phone
to iPad. Cause that's kind of always been the, the promise of all this stuff is that, you know,
You write something and then you got your little tiny baby version and it scales all the way up to your, you know
gigantic TV and this actually does that so do you use
Do you just use the little spinny crown thing on the watch or do you press it into or how does that work?
so with
Bricko you can use the crown to do different things, but I tend to just tap the screen
There are three different movements in BrickO, so you
side to side moves the bricks
Tapping on the screen shuffles the order of the bricks and then dragging down
Drops them where you want them
So I'm pretty sure you can do some of that using the crown
But I just prefer tapping the screen and then with the treasure map one
You just have to physically move like the puzzle pieces and they swap
So Jason is typically the gamer of a
Troika of people he's the one who plays fortnight and wins and that kind of thing
When it comes to Brick oh, I'm backing you Natasha, I'm thinking you're gonna you would take him to the cleaners
Well that actually brings up a good point in the fact that I now mandate that everyone purchased this game
First of all, it is one dollar ninety nine us
So that's like $87 Australian. Yeah, that sounds about right.
And we're gonna have a little competition over the course of the month of June
to get the highest score in each of the games within
Arcadia. I think it looks like there's maybe
6 or 12 games maybe? However many there are. I think there are like 18 games. Oh my goodness. Oh 18. Okay.
So we're gonna have a we're gonna have a ranking
leaderboard for each of the games within this to get the high score amongst
Everyone that has downloaded this it also has a good icon by the way
A lot of times you'll find something that's good and then the icon is kind of sucky
But that's the challenge we're having now. So everyone has to go download this game and have a leaderboard
It's gonna be tracked. It's very official. There's gonna be prizes
So get on it month of June. So you share your scores on a discord. Yep discord Twitter
- Does that mean I have to join the public Discord?
- Yes, you do, absolutely.
This was all a ruse to get you to join.
- You can tune in and out, believe me, it's fine.
Tune in and out, yeah.
- I think Hannah does a lot of tuning out.
- Yeah, you can tune in more than out, please.
But yeah, that's now where we're gonna be.
So you got a little time to practice.
Month of June is gonna be Arcadia June
'cause it rhymes, obviously.
- Really, really doesn't.
- Hey, oh my goodness, there's a baby.
Okay, but can I just double check?
And I'm sure this is, oh my goodness.
I'm sure this has probably been asked,
but I'm just double checking.
There's no in-app purchases.
Can I in-app purchase that baby?
(laughing)
- It appears there are zero in-app purchases, $1.99.
- That's it, it's a one-off,
and then you've got it on all your devices.
- Well, do you know what?
I got the Remarkable 2 over the last week,
and my screen time's gone down 42% on my phone.
Now, Arcadia June is gonna like take it up like 180%.
- Send it through the roof.
Sorry, he smells like a wheat bag
because we try and put one in his bassinet
to keep it warm, to make it more appealing.
- Okay, you are so much better parents
than we were, just quietly.
- We're trying everything,
but now he just smells like wheat.
(both laughing)
makes him even more edible. It's all fine. It just makes him smell like an old person.
I just love the fact this is the first episode releasing after we have rolled out our Patreon
service which some people have paid their own cold hard cash. What kind of money was that?
Cold hard earned? And now they're getting something entirely different to what they paid for.
Arguably better and I'm not discounting that but very different. I bet they're gonna all up their their
Contributions now, you know if they were at one level, they'll probably just bump up to the next level at this point
Jace you were talking about the one take my money person
Imagine how many take my money people you're gonna get after Natasha and I I mean really probably all exactly shout out to Gabriel
Number one fan of hemispheric views. Yeah for real
You didn't see that guys, but you just got the ultimate like chest bump
It looked really cool
Yeah, if you get another account and sign up for a second
Take my money account. We'll send you an animated gif of the shout out. You just got
Put a mark put a marker and we're back to hemisphere abuse
I think you are asking the question of us whether when we receive a receipt from the store
Or do we just crumple it up and throw it in the bin?
Or do we keep it or do something with it?
- Ah, yes.
And also, is there like 55,
like a lot of times in stores here,
you'll buy like one thing,
say it could be any price, doesn't matter.
And then you get a receipt
and it's like four kilometers long.
And I just, it's super annoying and frustrating.
And I never keep receipts.
I never want receipts.
No one should even bother with it.
But we have a lot of places here that will actually email you receipts now.
And I'm curious if that is a thing there at all, or do you just deal with the same
crap where they hand you a receipt, whether you want it or not, and then you
just chuck it in the bin or in my case, shred it.
I love your chuck it in the bin.
So that's a true Australianism there.
Well done.
Most places still give you a receipt.
Some of the, um, some stores like JB Hi-Fi will offer to email you a receipt,
But really it's just a play to get your details and to somehow tie you into some loyalty program
But yeah most places you still get a paper receipt and you're right we were talking about the Woolies
Dockets where basically at the bottom of a Woolies docket you have
Yeah, fuel offer four cents off four cents per liter of fuel followed by come to our
liquor store and you can get six pack of beer for this amount of price and a
Whole bunch of little bonus bonus things attached to your docket which doubles the length of it
Infuriating chuck them all shred them all don't ever give me a receipt
I will if it's something special if it's a it's a if it's an expensive item something that you might want to depreciate
I will scan that put it to Devon think
Save it for a rainy day Chuck the original at best
I will save it for the 30 days or whatever if I am on the fence if it's a
Thing I'm going to keep but generally no gone
That was easy. There you go. That's another that's another segment of our show taken care of
Martin probably keeps them all filed away in a filing cabinet sorted by alphabetized
numeric Johnny decimal code or something, you know, those you know, there's sleeves the little plastic sleeves that you put
- Oh, he's got the sleeves. - And he's shit the paper into.
I think he would put them in that.
- I am here to bust that myth.
He is the worst.
- What?
- The worst at keeping,
are you talking about keeping receipts and stuff?
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- He is the worst.
If it is not digital, it is dead to him.
We have almost missed paying bills
because I'm the bill payer.
But if it comes by mail and he gets the mail,
we almost get late notices because he just goes, meh.
He's the worst if it is not delivered digitally
or if it is not saved digitally, he will not,
it's dead to him.
- He should read the last edition of our hemispheric news
where I go through a very detailed process
of turning paper into digital assets.
- If it's important to him, he'll scan it,
but the only products that he cares about are the Apple ones
and they send you a receipt anyway, so.
- I could just see him getting his failed foot on,
calling the water company and saying,
yes, excuse me, I would like to pay a bill,
but until you issue me a digital invoice,
I won't be proceeding with payment.
- Don't get me started with Sydney Water
and trying to go digital.
Don't get me started.
I've got a bone to pick with them.
