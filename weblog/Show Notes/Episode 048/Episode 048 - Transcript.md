Thanks for joining us on a special episode of Hemispheric Views.
Today we have a different kind of show.
We have a guest who probably needs no introduction, but we're going to provide an introduction
anyway because we have an international audience.
have with us today, officially, it is His Excellency, the Honorable Kim Beazley AC,
Governor of Western Australia.
That is a mouthful.
I actually know him more as my father-in-law, which is a lot easier.
So I get away with calling him Kim, and I believe we're allowed to call you Kim for
the rest of the show.
Is that correct?
Absolutely.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
So people who listen to our show normally would be hearing a bunch of tech stuff, they'd
you're hearing some cultural references, differences and similarities between Australia and the United
States. So this is a little bit different, but there is a tie in, the theme does work,
because Kim Beazley has a very interesting insight into the relationship between Australia and the
United States. Do I need to just give the quick sort of background as to who you are, Kim? Do
you think that would be a reasonable thing for me to do? Yeah, well, I've had a lot to do over
my lengthy political career with the United States. I've always been fascinated by American
history, American politics and the rest of it since I was a kid. I suppose growing up during
the Vietnam War sort of really had America on our radar screen. Americans really have been on the
Australian radar screen since the Second World War. But the thing, American soft power rides
supreme here. I remember one leftist commentator was not very pro-US complaining when he said that
young Australians absorb American culture like blotters. And I think that's right. I think that's
true. So the American presence here is ubiquitous. By a massive margin, the American private sector
invests, is the leading investor in Australia, foreign investor in Australia. And I think,
I can stand corrected on this, I think they invest, the US invests more in Australia than
it does in China. So it's a very big presidency. And you become conscious of that in politics,
but I became particularly conscious in the five to six years that I was defense minister.
And then subsequently, of course, the six years I spent in the US as ambassador.
It is quite the CV you have.
And just for some of our listeners that probably aren't so aware, you were a federal politician
in the Australian Labor Party for 27 years, I think.
So you're in federal government.
You held a range of portfolios.
And the one that jumped out at me most is the, and that would appeal to our listeners
would be that of communications minister.
Oh, yeah.
Probably a very different type of communications as to what we have today.
But nevertheless, it ticked the nerd box.
So we like that one.
The one I imagine you liked most was being defense minister and then obviously leader
of the opposition for quite some time as well.
The end of that distinguished parliamentary career, you went on to be Australia's ambassador
to the USA from 2010 to 2016.
And now you're holding the role of governor of Western Australia, which is essentially
the Queen's representative as part of our parliamentary system from 2018 to the current
day.
I think that's quite... it's not even the full CV, Kim, but it's the most important
salient bits that I could pull out.
But I thought we might just kick off with perhaps when people hear the word 'governor',
and particularly in America, that may mean a very different thing.
Could you just provide us an outline as to what a governor is in Western Australia?
It's totally different from that in the United States.
In the US, the executive is separate from the legislature.
That applies right the way around the United States.
In Australia, the executive is in the legislature.
So the governor is not the executive, as the governor is the executive in the US.
Where the governor comes in is the fact that our constitutional arrangements have us as
a constitutional monarchy, not a republic.
And because we're a constitutional monarchy, there is some locus within the system for
the Queen.
In Britain, it's very easy.
The Queen sort of operates as a super governor in the United Kingdom.
She's much more embedded in the political process that has to be said than the governors
in the states which emulate the constitutional monarchy.
So people keep trying to get me to respond to crises or issues that they find themselves
in in the middle of West Australian politics to second guess the government.
You point out to them that really, I represent only one person.
The Premier of the state and the cabinet in the state, they represent the people, they're
elected.
I'm not elected, I'm appointed.
And that therefore for me to conduct any of the sort of interference that they want me
to conduct would be vidious and anti-democratic.
So the Constitution allows for some level of intervention by the governor in the case
of a complete impasse and breakdown in the legislative process.
But those events are as rare as hence to.
Yeah, I think Martin is a bit of a fan of Australian politics.
And he often wants to stay at the constitutional corner on our normal podcast.
He gets quite excited about this kind of stuff.
You got anything to say on that, Martin?
I suppose there's also a reason that the word controversy or controversial starts with
CON as well.
So I try to restrain myself from bringing that up on the podcast.
But today's a much more appropriate time, I think.
But you're right, Andrew, that I love that whole topic.
And your excellency, I have to say it at least once, Kim, it's really exciting to have you
on the show today.
And I remember very vividly as a kid, when you were actually the federal opposition leader,
as Andrew mentioned, and even though I didn't quite appreciate it all at the time, and what
the system was and how everything worked, it's amazing how that kind of time leaves
an impression on you.
And to speak to you today is actually a great pleasure.
It's interesting how these things come around.
to ask you a question, actually, because we've mentioned Western Australia. It's where you're
based. People listening to the show get a taste and a flavour of what Western Australia is from
Andrew. I've only ever had the pleasure of visiting once. How would you describe Western
Australia to our audience? Well, we were once known as the
state of the sun, the sea, the sand, sore eyes and Sir John Forrest, who was the first Premier.
and the sore eyes was the sort of blinding sun and the sand and wind to give us various eye
diseases. So that sort of era is somewhat behind us now. This is a very fast growing stuff.
When I was a boy, when I was say 15 years old, for argument's sake, in this city of ours in Perth,
there are about 500,000 people and 65% of them had been born in Western Australia.
So I was one of the majority, it was a very small city. Now 2.5 million people, a bit less than
that, but 2 to 2.5 million, and the majority of people are born elsewhere. So it's had a huge
influx of population. And that's been built largely on the fact that we have become the
capital, but probably the world's largest mineral province. You've got here in Western Australia,
the old minerals, if you like, the iron ores, aluminas, bauxite and so on, the old ores,
the old minerals, and we've also got all the rare earths. We've got a stack of them here.
We've got the biggest rare earth mine in the world. Then you've got on top of that, you've
got Nickel, you've got Cobalt, you've got a Lithium, huge Lithium production here.
So you've just got a whole range of critical minerals. That's driven an enormous amount of
wealth. And it's driven a lot of innovative technology. And the technology is done not
in the mines, the technology is done around here. Our mines tend to be highly robotised.
So NASA's come over to partner with one of our producers, Woodside, as they think that
Woodside is more advanced than they are in robotisation. So they want to use the Australian
Woodside product and technology in their moon rovers that they're developing at the moment,
with a view to using also Mars rovers subsequently. So the state's really quite an exciting phase.
That's interesting. It makes an interesting place to be. Plus it's got a beautiful light.
It's a good place to visit when you're allowed to.
We're not letting many people in at the moment.
We are allowed to, but you have to quarantine.
It's a bit of a challenge at the moment.
This is probably like one that Jason might be able to reflect on the best. We're thinking about
the time that you were the ambassador to the United States and you in that time, I imagine
you encountered many interesting people. Is there anybody that jumps out to you as somebody
particularly interesting that you met during that time? Well, you can't go much past the
president of the day, who was Barack Obama. He was a fascinating bloke to listen to,
which I did a few times, not super often. I met Joe Biden more often than that.
He did a very kind thing to me when I left from being ambassador. He said,
"Why don't you come down and have a... He's vice president. Come down and have a chat."
So I got all this staffing and we just bulldozed it for about an hour or so.
politics. Some of our experiences were more or less in common in the political arena.
So it was a nice office. So Joe was pretty impressive. The president was pretty impressive.
I found Hillary Clinton impressive. She was a very good Secretary of State. I mean,
if she'd chosen not to run for president, she would be up there in the pantheon of great
great American politicians, a great American Secretary of State.
But her reputation was sort of massively trashed during the course
of the presidential campaign, which I think is a tragedy for her.
So she was impressive.
I'd seen him before, met him a few times, Henry Kissinger, of course.
And likewise, George Shultz, but
I'd known him very well back when I was defense minister.
Look, there are just so many issues. The thing about the United States is sort of the massive
intellectual heft of the place. Well, we've got one here. We've got Jason. So, yeah, that just
intellectual heft right with us today. Is that a term that you associate with,
Jason? Intellectual heft? Always. In terms of that six-year period, 2010 to 2016,
What does that actually look like from your point of view?
Is this a heavy travel type of position where you're back and forth between
Australia and the United States often, or is it paperwork based for lack of a better term?
Not paperwork based. I used to say to the staff at the embassy,
this is where it is most important for me to be.
We have fabulous access in Washington, DC.
And if you want me to leave here for any purpose,
you better have a very good reason.
As it happens, I did get out to about,
I think it was 27 states, but not to see them really.
I took a couple of holidays down in Florida
and semi-holidays across in LA.
I had a daughter who was studying at USC at the time.
So, but basically it was DC.
And it's just a massive information bank
'Cause even though every week, more or less,
you'd be in the State Department,
you'd be in the White House or Executive Office Building,
you'd be in, less often, the Pentagon and CIA
and other arms of American intelligence.
You'd be constantly meeting with the people
from the various peak agencies
amongst American exporters and the like
in business side of things.
And then the think tanks,
so there's over 300 of them in Washington.
You're at peak info and you've got to drag all this together
and write home on the things that the home is,
the department is,
and the other departments are fascinated by.
So I did get chastised by one of the intelligence agencies
once that my cables weren't interesting enough.
And I thought, "Oh, they're pretty good."
And he said, "Yes, we want gossip."
I'm going to become a gossip columnist for the benefit of the Office of National Assessment.
I was going to say, when you were having these various meetings with US officials and so
on, were there moments where the Australian sensibilities just didn't transfer or didn't
translate?
Would they sometimes miss your point because you had an Australian way of thinking or seeing
the world?
always possible. American humor doesn't run heavily to irony.
And occasionally, if you're being ironical, you are
misunderstood. And Americans being ultra polite, think that
they've somehow offended you or you're worried about something
and immediately rush to try and work out how they can
ameliorate it. So, but I didn't know. I knew a lot of Americans.
I've been with Americans most of my life, and so I get to know them pretty well.
And I know how to avoid elements of the Australian language,
which is alien, which are alien or different for them.
So I don't have too much problems with the translations.
And the great thing about the people you talk to in the US
is that they're not very circumspect.
They talk very openly.
you don't sit down and have a sort of gentlemanly debate or discussion with whoever it is you've
seen on the other side and that's useful because actually you do get exactly what they mean and
what they're talking about and you can convey that home because sometimes home doesn't pick up
and that is important that they do because when you're an ambassador you're actually dealing
when we are dealing with forces in the field and that sort of thing in Iraq, Afghanistan.
So these are issues which may be issues ultimately of life and death. You're dealing with big picture
items, the character of our relationships in this region, the character of our relationships
with other countries like China. It's pretty full on. It is pretty high stakes stuff when you're an
ambassador in the United States, if you're Australian, it's our most important relationship.
It's only our third biggest embassy, I have to say. The biggest embassy is Indonesia,
and the second biggest is Papua New Guinea. Wow.
Yeah, so there you go. Never picked that. Jason, do you have any, a rebuttal to those,
that characterization? Well, I'm a little ashamed we're only third in terms of the
largest embassies. We'll work on that for sure. I would never ask you to pick a favorite state
in the United States because that's just going to cause all kinds of controversy from our side. But
let's just say, which area of the US did you find to be most like back home and which was
just completely opposite? I love being in DC. I love being in Virginia. There's areas around
beautiful place, wonderful historical location. If somebody said you're going to go and live in
the United States, I'd probably pick Virginia immediately to DC. That's what I'd do.
Fascinating places that look like, the nearest thing to Perth, I think is San Diego.
When you go there, you have a bit of a sense that you've just gone home. And then Sydney
It's got a lot in common with LA.
Melbourne is more like, say, Philadelphia.
That's more of the ambience of Melbourne.
Brisbane, well, also San Diego, very similar in setup
to San Diego, or one of those cities
along the coastline of California.
we're not wet enough to be like Seattle or Portland. We're a bit dry. It's really, but
that's, yeah, it's the West Coast of the United States generally, but not exclusively, that
provides the nearest equivalence to Australia.
Happy to hear it.
And you mentioned the way the light is different in Perth. Is that something to do with being
on the West Coast facing an ocean?
It's also the general cloudlessness of the place.
San Diego is like that too.
It's no accident the American film industry is in LA
and Southern California.
It's light.
And the light that is there is the same light that there is
in Western Australia.
We have over here an American actress named Kate Walsh.
was in various medical dramas and the like in American TV and a few films and the rest
of it.
And she's desperately trying to get up a film studio here or encourage us to get up a film
studio here because she thinks that this is the best life that she's come across for purposes
of filming in her career.
I never heard that trait and I've lived here all my life.
Totally unaware of that one, shows how much I know about cinematography.
Can I ask you, Kim, I just wanted, this is the family section of the questioning here.
You obviously come from a line of politicians before you, your father was a politician and
you've sort of been the end of that line for some time.
now you're not the caboose, but you're a middle carriage because your daughter and my wife,
Hannah, is now a member of parliament in the WA. Yes. Now, conscious of your role and your
separation from that, I don't want to get you in any trouble about what you say, but from a personal,
experiential point of view, how does it feel to not be the end of the line of the Beasleys in
politics nowadays. I'm very proud of Hannah. I'm very grateful for what a wonderful support for
her that you are. If you take the three of us, she's the most talented and that's what you'd
expect. You get better and better and better. There's a slight dip in the middle, however,
in my case. Hannah is way ahead of me. She's the real deal. She's a great retail politician and
And she's a great detail politician in the modern age, if you like.
Because in my time, when I was a member of parliament,
social media was negligible.
It's been at the same time democratising, but also extremely troubling,
because what it does permit is the spread of lies and bulldust.
And often those lies are dangerous and enormously damaging
to the societies in which they're in, in which they're promulgated
with a very easy mechanism of promulgation.
On the other hand, it's been enormously democratized
because it does enable an individual voice.
Now, when I started off in politics,
there were no individual voices.
No mechanism for the ordinary Joe
to get his or her view up to a consideration
of the broader public.
Now they can.
And it also means that a lot of campaigning now, which used to cost a load of money
when I was in the business, now very inexpensive. Provided you do your social media well,
it doesn't cost you much. That's an important attribute, enormously important. If you're
of a movement or an individual who doesn't actually have much capacity to access such resources.
So, Hannah has mastered all contemporary technologies in relation to political campaigning,
political communications, policy development and the like. So, she's a special.
Martin, you're our social media guru here on the show. So, take it away from there on that topic.
That's very kind. I'm glad you brought up the point about social media. And if Hannah has
managed to balance that and achieve that, that's amazing, because I don't think anyone is free of
social media injuries or controversies or arguments online. It's very easy to attract.
And a great point you raised about individual voices being able to rise up or say something,
on a much less, I suppose, political note, generally, this podcast and many other podcasts
are great examples of that, the way that technology is so much more accessible and affordable that
you can have different voices, voices rising up where I suppose we're examples of fairly
privileged white males in this regard. But there are lots of people who've been able to
have themselves heard who haven't before. On that topic of technology, though, and how things have
changed. How would you say there are other ways that technology might have improved or developed
over the course of your political and now current career? What would you say are some things that
have changed that you've had to grapple with or adapt to?
Many things. 24-hour news cycles. That is, it makes extraordinarily difficult
the exposition and development of a long-term proposition. And it means you're constantly,
when you may be trying to convey to the public a theme that you think is important too,
you're going to get easily knocked aside by the latest thing that people want to play with.
What I tend to find with the younger generation are totally tech savvy, totally… well, tech savvy is
a silly expression, really. It's just degrading their personality. I mean, I look at my youngest
daughter and she sits with a computer in front of her. She doesn't look at her hands and her hands
just move across the computer without seemingly thinking. And it just translates whatever it is
in her head straight onto the computer without resting for a moment. That familiarity is at
the most, at the one time enormously enabling and at another level, incredibly dissipating,
diffusing. It means you're casting multiple lines simultaneously. And if you're trying to get people
to solidly focus on an issue, or something that they need to deal with, then it becomes extremely
hard to get up what becomes very soon a boring thing without finding everybody's attention taken
by a toy that somebody drops into the middle of the process. We witnessed that in the previous
American administration. I mean, Trump has a genius for being able to distract. So a line
can be running and he'll come out with some outrageous statement and everybody goes and
plays with that for the next 24 hours, usually in an area where he thinks he strengthens himself,
and usually does. And then you come back and start another track going and then another toy gets
thrown in by him and everybody goes off and plays with that. So it's taken a lot of the solidity
out of things. It's also taken, I think, the capacity to develop a long and deep,
both argument and program. Something I've noticed about young people, when you're talking to them,
they're all over every issue, they're really very knowledgeable, but they don't go beyond
about three or four paragraphs. And this is potentially a bit of a problem when what you
actually need is a bit of depth. I sort of contrast in the modern form of government,
or you take federal government here, compared to government that I was engaged in in the 80s,
when I was a defense minister. In those days, the deed was the deed. In other words,
your focus was on what it is that you wanted to do, acquire, build, change, transform, whatever.
Now, for a lot of politicians, the word is the deed. The deed is no longer the deed,
The word is the deed. So they will say something right about climate. They're on the left.
They'll say something appealing about race or something else if they're on the right.
Immigration. And what it is, is this endless flow of crap, unmitigated crap, to somebody
it's virtue signaling.
And there are a whole, one of the things I think we do understand thoroughly now, there
is no such thing as the people.
There are very many peoples located in a location and we're all very different views and the
rest of it.
But none of this stuff actually advances the coherence or effectiveness of society.
I think America survives experiencing in many ways the worst of this.
Because the US is such a brilliantly inventive people.
So the fact that it is, if you're looking for focus in the United States, the place
is anarchy.
There are many societies more focused, but they're very much more undesirable societies,
to be frank.
But at least in the case of the United States, its character means that it's always inventing
things and changing things. And that in many ways is its strength. It falls behind every now and
then technologically and six months later, it'll be ahead again. Other societies don't have that
flexibility. So, I think that mitigates the potentially baneful impacts of that sort of
diffusion when it comes to American politics. I really love the point that you made about
a loss or a degradation in the focus that we can all achieve because tying things in with our
audience, a lot of people who listen to us and with whom we communicate online are really interested
in technology and how it can be used for their work or creative endeavors or leisure or whatever,
you name it. And something that comes up a lot on the networks that we engage with, particularly
micro.blog where we met, is people are often talking about what tools are you using? What
What are you using to read your news?
How are you minimizing or focusing
on what you're consuming or what you're working on?
So I think what you say about the US
being kind of lacking in focus
has bled out elsewhere in the world
because I often feel that myself.
I went to school learning how to hand write
and having everything in print,
but as the years have gone on,
more and more things have become digital.
Things have become hyper efficient
and so much more searchable,
but you feel that lack of focus
as you jump from task to task,
from event to event, story to story.
Just quickly, I know we've spoken a bit
about this technological thing here.
Do you find yourself having to strive for focus sometimes,
even in your own life?
- Well, I'm too embedded as a dinosaur.
I don't know what else does, but I do.
And-- - A good thing, maybe.
- And when it comes to technology,
I have to ask Andrew or--
(Andrew laughs)
I'm always here for tech support.
That is a role of life.
I want my children to come and help out because I'm hopeless.
I am a technological dinosaur.
So yeah, I mean, I don't extend really beyond Google.
Google and emails, so that's it for me.
But it's still, it is a, it's powerful.
I mean, the technology is now immensely powerful.
we contemplate the fact that about five years from now they'll be infinitely more sophisticated than
they are now, it does boggle the mind. I think the sort of complaints I make about it are
just spitting in the wind, frankly. This is the way we're going to go. I think
It has the means of workarounds. So you get a place like China, which basically censors the
people's access to information. And even half bright technologists in China work their way
around all the walls that the government puts in place to prevent them from seeing what's
happening elsewhere. The Chinese know exactly what's going on in the United States, even though
and they know what the United States thinks of them.
They will all know somebody
who can work their way around all the barriers
that the technological barriers
the Chinese government puts in place.
The Chinese are pretty advanced technologically,
but the Chinese people much more so.
- Well, I think, as I said before,
it's possibly not such a bad thing to be a dinosaur,
as you call yourself.
(laughing)
It can be exhausting seeking focus, so.
- I'm pretty focused.
- Thumbs up from me, I think that's great.
should all be more of a dinosaur.
That's what we've got next, Kim. We came up with some questions that we've classified
as the rapid fire round. So, these are some sort of quick questions we thought we'd ask
of you. Jason, we talked about this a bit before we started recording, but I think it's
important that you get this question taken care of.
In terms of traveling to Portland, Oregon, lovely, lovely Portland, Oregon that we thought
maybe you had been to, but it sounds like maybe not.
No, I knew as soon as I got to you, mate, it was Seattle.
We'll count it as close enough.
Yeah, right, but Seattle was lovely.
Well, Jason, ask the next one then, Jason.
Oh boy.
Okay, you're going to put me on the spot for this one.
Great.
So, you get to choose where you're going to live and your choices are Perth, Wollongong,
Portland slash Seattle, since you haven't been here. I can
live it all. I really couldn't. Even Wollongong? Hey now. Oh
come on. Wollongong Abrave. It's a I I I think it's a great
town. I I've enjoyed visiting there on on numerous occasions.
I like the politics of Wollongong I have to say. I have
this view. When I was the leader of the opposition. I went to
this thing, this Sydney development forum. I said, 'Look, I'm going to tell you something I'm not
going to put out in the promise because in these days where you have great fiscal
recognition, you can't get away with it, but I know that we can afford it.' What I want to do
and will do, and then it would have cost about $12 or $14 billion, it wasn't super impressive,
I want to do a maglev rail line that goes through, starts in Canberra, goes through
Goulburn, Woolloongong into Sydney, then up through to Byron Bay. And if you do that,
you actually, instead of spreading Sydney, you know, now to increasingly getting towards across
the Blue Mountains, but an uncontrollable, really uncontrollable road, sclerotic road system
in the town. You actually spread the population to satellite cities where amenity is going to be
much better. And because it's so fast, you'd be from any one of those points maximum about an
hour away from the CBD and from Wollongong, you know, like about 10 or 15 minutes away from the
CBD. And that would totally transform the development of the city. Unfortunately, I
never got the chance to do that. But that would have, then in those days, that would have cost
$14 billion. You can use a maglev, it's not very good for freight transport, but it sits easily on
on the environment.
It's you don't have to cut.
If you used any other fast rail system to go to
Newcastle, you have to cut through the mountain,
cross the earth.
You just go over when you've got you've got
Maglev and around.
And so it's a shame
I never got the chance to do that.
I think it would have been quite transformative in New
South Wales, would have been quite transformative in
Wollongong.
I think Martin complains about having to take the train
from Wollongong to Sydney, don't you?
Isn't that one of your pet peeves?
In the past, yes.
Yes.
You wouldn't worry about this one, mate.
You'd be there in about 15, 20 minutes.
If it had been realised, my hands would be aching from endless applause.
And Seattle is a lovely place to be.
They've got quite a big collection at their Museum of Aboriginal Artifacts.
Really?
Museum, art gallery, whatever it is, it's brilliant.
And I love Seattle.
I like Washington.
When I was defense minister, I really wanted to restructure the Australian Army like the
American 9th Infantry Division, which was at Fort in near Seattle.
And I remember meeting Storming Norman Schwartz, who was famous for battles in Kuwait, and
And he was the head of ICOR, which is headquartered in Seattle.
And he just, just most extraordinarily beautiful place.
Well, Kim, you have not lost your political skills because we asked you to choose one
and you just successfully chose all three.
Wollongong got some good airtime though, so I'm going to take that as a win.
It did.
Quickly, you were talking about the maglev train.
I'm curious, you've obviously spent time around the US,
27 states.
You're in Australia now and have been for a while.
What do you find to be differences and similarities
between public transportation of Australia
versus the United States?
Because we historically have not been, I will say,
great at public transportation.
- No, that's right.
Airspace is pure brilliance and terrifically convenient.
I like the antrac between Washington and New York.
that was good. And it was a nice service.
The US is, you've got a different challenge.
The US just has a mass of people to move.
You've got to remember that the continental United States,
you know, exclude Alaska, Hawaii,
continental United States is the same size as Australia.
And in the continental United States,
you've got 330 million people.
and in Australia, you've got 25 rule.
That completely changes all the things
that you can conceivably think about
when it comes to transport challenges.
I mean, in greater New York,
you've got half the population of Australia
slotted into an area probably about the size of Sydney.
And in Sydney, we struggled with public transport in Sydney.
It's okay, but it's a source of constant complaint.
Imagine being with half the population of Australia
sitting in the same area,
trying to manage the public transport issues
which flow from that.
You know, I'd say such a massive place,
it's a big country, but in population terms,
it is simply massive.
And so anything that you do
is always going to be challenged.
You're going to be always logistically challenged.
You're always going to be challenged in transport terms.
I used to be Aviation Minister at one point of time in Australia when we had such a portfolio.
It's now rolled up in transport.
It wasn't then.
What they used to point out to me in this area, which is the same as the continental
United States, we fly one and a half percent of the world's paid passenger miles.
The US flies 65% of the world's paid passenger miles.
That's all in the same area.
People sit around, they have their complaints about the US on this or that front.
I think it's brilliant that the US actually works.
And it works democratically.
could imagine a totalitarian system that shot its way to obedience, you would probably find
management a lot easier in those circumstances. God, would you want to live? And that's the thing,
the US actually manages to make it self-livable. But it's sort of one of the odd things about the
US when I was there, you become very conscious, you're actually not dealing with one country.
The American colonies and then the subsequently expanded states were each of them particular
unto themselves. The unity enforced by the creation of the nation was a unity which did not
necessarily fit the people who are actually there. So now you're probably in the US,
you've got half a dozen countries, but with a perfectly functioning trading system, free
trade system between them, which allows for great economic efficiency. Europe, which is of a similar
size, slightly bigger in population terms, slightly smaller in geography, well, they can't
quite make it. So, America is probably have been like Europe if it had developed according to its
own separateness, but it never did. And Australia has Queensland.
We have Queensland. The rest of Australia would say they have Western Australia.
Shame on them.
Kim, you said that you're a bit of a technological Luddite. So, what is your
favorite computing device? You have to pick one.
My mobile phone.
Nothing else.
And that is an iPhone, isn't it?
Just...
Good to clarify.
I don't have a laptop.
I basically just use the iPhone because anything you can get off a laptop, you get off an iPhone.
So, I sometimes think my staff must think I'm a lazy bastard because I'm sitting there behind my
this. My iPhone will do it. I'm sending my emails and communicating all over the place.
Can I just jump in here? And this might come across as unnecessary flattery, but I mean this.
You called yourself a dinosaur, but when the iPhone came out and then the iPad, a lot of
listeners here who are Apple fans, particularly, might remember that Steve Jobs and others kind
of said, "Oh, we've entered the post-PC era where the laptop and the desktop is, you know,
they're less necessary. They're things of the past. So really, you leapfrogged, or you leapt ahead of
everyone and took on that post PC philosophy. You're further ahead than most people, I would say.
Yeah, but I think the PC allows you to water your thoughts in a way much more effectively than
an iPhone does. I think there's something about having that effectively typewriter in front of you
that enables you to think a bit more clearly.
It brings back to your point of being focused, right? That's your focus,
whereas your mobile device is your shallow but broad.
That's probably right.
Okay. Now, we're tackling another huge issue here. When you were in the US,
did you discover a favorite food that you can no longer obtain now that you're back in Australia?
Oh god, no. I mean, I hate to tell you this Jason, but basically food in the US is not as good as
food in Australia, in one particular. We do produce a better quality food here and of course
we have to feed far fewer people and so there's a certain advantage that we have here.
but the US kills us in all forms of meat. American steak is much better. Now that doesn't mean it's
much healthier. American steak is basically marbled, basically grain fed. Australian steak
is grass fed and a stringy crap but it's very helpful. But American hamburgers are vastly
superior to Australian hamburgers. Anything you care to name that is related to red meat,
the US does much better. Anything unhealthy, that's what we're known for.
I'm not really bothered turning up at steakhouses here, but in the US I would all the time because
you knew you'd get a great fee. So I do miss, I miss American steaks over here. And so I've
become much less of a steak eater. Just to flip that question, if you don't mind, when you were
in the US, what was it that you missed about Australian cuisine or produce?
Oh, the quality. I didn't miss that quite a lot anywhere where I was eating, basically.
And Australian ethnic food, it just struck me that Indian restaurants are pretty close
in the US, but I still thought ours were better.
Chinese, ours are a lot better.
Since I'm a devotee of ethnic food, I did miss that.
You don't want to spend your whole time feeding, do you?
Feeding the mind is a lot easier in the US than it is in Australia.
You've had a long and distinguished career in public service, and this may be an impossible
question, but of what achievement would you say you are most proud?
Oh, mate.
Sorry, mate.
And go through the restructuring of Australian Defence Forces in discussing that. Or I would go
to when I was opposition leader, being the first person to put targets into an election campaign to
deal with the consequences of global warming. That was the 2001 election. I put that down.
I put down the reform of communications where we introduced sort of private competition
into the telecommunications system. But nowadays, in the environment in which we are now,
constitutional collapse. I think the 1984 electoral act, in which was not my invention,
but I had to be the minister to shepherd it through Parliament. But it was done by our party
bosses who, you know, in the way in which our system works, always a few of the people who are
party secretaries at state level or party directors at state level, find their way into the House or
Senate. And it did so happen in 1983 that there was a really quite potent collection of them from
the Liberal Party and Labor Party sides. And they decided after a couple of beers that they would
mutually disarm. So how about we stop trying to rort the electoral system and we create the
fairest system in the world? And they sat down and worked that out. They did it with a self-denying
ordinance really on the Labor Party, which was that in all the things that they're suggesting,
if one side really objected, now they disagree, but if they really objected and put up a red flag,
the other side wouldn't do it. So there was a restraint really on the Labor Party because
we had the numbers. But we stuck to that and there was one thing the Liberals put up a red flag on,
which the Labor Party then didn't do because of their level of objection. But we introduced
totally independent boundaries. We introduced, and forcibly so, regularly redistributed boundaries.
So they could be actually distributed between each election, redistributed,
if the formulas that were put in place to govern the direction of the distribution
provided a situation where too many seats got out of kilter, and they can in a fast-growing area.
But that can happen, and you have to do, then, a redistricting to deal with that.
So we had that and a totally independent process by which that was done.
And we introduced much easier voting, pre-polls, that sort of thing,
sort of stuff that the Americans were doing last time,
last presidential election, you could say.
And we had, you know, publicly funded election campaigns
that came in, there's just a lot of change. We put party designations on the ballot paper,
that wouldn't seem like much to Americans, but what that does, of course, is if people don't
actually have poll workers adjacent to them, they actually know who's what on the ballot paper,
which is a big help. But there are all this sort of stuff that we put in place. And we introduced,
I think the fairest electoral system in the world, the most, certainly most honest and least politically interfered and
It got through
Everybody has forgotten how that happened. Everybody's forgotten how it started
But it started with some of the biggest oriented in the rorting direction and all sides of Australian politics
just deciding to declare themselves redundant and
And it was a great thing
Every now and then people try to interfere with that.
The latest interference is attempts to introduce
photographic identification of the boat
and that sort of thing.
And every now and sometimes changing
the declaration donations that...
So people tended to forget
the sort of self-denying ordinance type capability
that was there in the '84 Act
when they now 30 years on try to do amendments to it.
So, you know, it helps to be old sometimes, you've got a wrong people who are actually
legislating now.
That's a fascinating answer and not one that I expected.
But you're right.
I think the Australian public sort of take all that for granted these days and expect
the AEC to do their job and the Electoral Commission to do their job and manage the
election fairly.
And it's just an assumed part of the deal now.
And you saw, I think public got a bit into an uproar when there were attempts to change
that and have identification more recently of the vote, that kind of thing.
That did seem like the public pushed back against it.
I think it's become a cultural norm.
That's what we expect from an election, that it's free and fair and left alone from the
politicians as such.
So well done.
Great answer.
All good.
That I think gets us to the end of our questions.
I'll pass over to the other guys if there's anything else they wanted to say.
I'll just throw in a concluding thought that this has been a tremendous pleasure and a
wonderful answer at the end, I would agree.
And I think it also speaks to what you were saying about a lot of people these days not
really reading past the three or four initial paragraphs.
It's good to have that longer memory, be grateful for the system that we're in and what we're
achieving.
And yeah, I think I might take on more of your technological ideas.
I've got to say, it's lovely talking to you, Blake.
And well done in getting this together, putting it together.
Sometimes you think the world's going to hell in a handbasket, but you realise probably
it's not.
I think that every single week.
Thank you so much for joining us.
We really, really appreciate it.
Yes, wonderful.
Thank you so much.
That was, I'm going to say this one more time, His Excellency, the Honourable Kim Beazley,
AC, Governor of Western Australia.
That's fun to say.
Thank you for joining us on Hemispheric Views.
I was distracted by myself.
