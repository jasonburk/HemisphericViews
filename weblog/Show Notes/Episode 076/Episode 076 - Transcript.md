Nope, hold on. I forgot something. Hey, so set podcast focus mode
Try again, we're gonna try that again. Hey set podcasting focus mode
Hold please while I manually click the button
Okay, we're good now I think everything's set
[Music]
There's a bunch of stuff we could talk about. We have a run sheet.
We do.
Do you know the one thing we don't have on the run sheet?
Some already screwed it up. It's all the new Apple equipment that got released.
I think that shows just how much we cared.
I mean to be fair it rarely makes it on the list.
There's just a lot of stuff that we don't need so.
It's funny how ostensibly we started off as a bit of a tech podcast.
And now we've vaguely drifted away.
Then we're tech adjacent and now we're just kind of random stuff.
Can I bring it back to tech?
Can I do that for you?
Can I help you with that?
that here we go. Okay. The highly anticipated follow-up from episode 75,
the very end, we all want to know did Andrew get Tot installed on his Apple
watch? Wow. Now I checked the Vegas odds on this. Okay. And if you were betting on
yes he did I'm afraid you're probably gonna lose a lot of money but we'll see
right now, Andrew, did you get Tot installed on your Apple Watch? Yeah, look,
it was quite a journey. You sort of, people heard a little bit of the
beginnings of that journey towards the end of the recording. So I've tried to
capture my steps as best I can, but to answer your question, yes I did get Tot
installed on my Apple Watch. Oh my gosh. Alright, so coming from behind with
With the three-point installation to tie it into basketball, he actually got it installed.
Have you used it?
Would be my follow-up question.
Well, perhaps before I get to that, I want to talk you through just a little bit of the
installation experience.
Yeah.
Can you tell us the quick and easy version of how quick and fast it is to get things
installed on the Apple Watch?
So my previous experience with Apple Watch apps has been you generally install the app
on your phone and then a little companion app sort of automatically installs on your watch.
And so that was my initial reaction, my initial thought, okay I've got Tot on my Mac and on my
phone therefore it shall be on my watch. I went, well I couldn't find it, so I went to the watch
application on my phone, scrolled through all the different apps looking for, maybe it just
just didn't install for some reason.
Top was not listed.
That's odd.
How do I get it?
I go back to the app store on the phone.
There's no mention of watch.
Then I think, Jason, you said to me,
you need to use the app store on the phone,
which I had entirely, not on the watch,
I'd entirely forgotten that that thing existed.
So I found it.
I tried to sign in.
I got my password wrong trying to sign in because--
typing on your watch or scribbling.
- You didn't type on that itty bitty keyboard?
- Yeah, so well I tried,
I thought it would copy and paste over
and it looked like it provided some method to do that.
But when I actually tried to log in,
the app store on the watch just hung.
It just spinner, never ending spinner
to the point where I had to reboot my watch.
So reboot my watch, go back in,
try and do the copy paste password again
and again and again, fails multiple times.
the watch will not accept the pasted password
in the watch app store.
Okay, fine.
This is clearly not gonna work.
I resort to using the scribble
to write in a long complex password.
Number of times it mistook capitals for lowercase
and trying to convince scribble you wanted one or the other.
That was not an easy task.
Got there in the end.
So once I scribbled in my complex password,
spent my $2.99 Australian, I had it on my watch.
All good, until I think,
well, what do I do with the watch apps?
I use complications.
Well, this is an app.
If anything's gonna have a complication,
it's gonna be this.
This is custom built for the watch platform.
There are no complications for Tot.
So the only way you can load it
is to go into the app selector,
spin around till you find it.
Hopefully it's still in your recents.
And then load it from there.
And that's as far as I've gotten.
How do you enter text?
I don't know.
I don't know how you enter text in it.
I just look at the stuff I've already written
somewhere else and go, hmm, interesting.
So this, Drafts does it better.
That's what I'm gonna say.
If you want a good app for your watch, just get Drafts.
- Well, I've entered text in it a couple of times,
but not in a way that is anywhere near the volume
of my phone or my Mac.
Jason, do you know how to enter text on TOT on your watch?
You worked it out?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
I mean, I don't think it's really meant,
I would use it more as a reference app
than a text entry type solution for sure.
- Like Andrew was suggesting.
- Yeah, so you just have your watch,
you're like, oh shoot, what was the parking spot number
or the whatever, something like that.
That's more the use case that I see it fitting.
So I am impressed and excited that you got it installed
and you don't use it.
That's fantastic.
And he's looking at it right now
and right now he's attempting to enter text on his watch.
(laughing)
- How do you, oh there's here we go.
Tap it.
(laughing)
(upbeat music)
- Well you know what I wanna talk about?
- What?
- It's something that we don't talk about hardly ever.
- What's that?
OnePrimePlus.com.
I know, most people are like, what?
One, who, who is this?
One Prime?
I don't understand.
Well, let me tell you about OnePrimePlus.com.
It's a little community of folks that have decided that,
you know what, this show's great
if there only were another way to get more and give more.
Well, there is.
It's OnePrimePlus.com.
And we did a little transition recently.
This is a little bit of a reminder.
we switched platforms of how oneprimeplus.com works.
Guess what though, oneprimeplus.com,
still the place to go, all good, so no problems there.
And I have to say, pretty high percentage of folks
came over and decided to re-sign up.
So huge thanks to everybody that came over
'cause it was a manual re-sign up,
which I know is not great,
but thank you all for doing that.
We very much appreciate it.
And this month, or this recording rather,
the newest One Prime Plus member, Matthew K.
Thank you so much, Matthew,
for joining the Hemispherians/One Prime Plusians.
Feel free to give us whatever details you want
in terms of being able to send you stickers.
There's the Discord with the special channel in there
that unlocks once you become a One Prime Plus subscriber
and just a fantastic little community of folks
that will be more than willing to chat with you.
So jump in there, everybody, oneprimeplus.com.
We're getting our member benefit stuff sorted out for 2023.
We're gonna switch it up a little bit,
do things a little differently so it's not just,
here's the same stuff over and over and over.
Live events, trying to plan those right now for hopefully,
I don't wanna say dates right now
because then it will be wrong.
So I'll just say planning for future dates
for more live events and just more cool stuff
for us all to do together in general.
So that is my one prime plus plug of the day.
- That was an excellent live read by Jason.
Don't you think?
Don't you think he could do just dynamically inserted ads?
He did that so well.
- I totally agree.
- I also have a question for Jason.
Matthew Kay, newest one prime plus member.
He knows it's in the long game.
Have we geolocated him?
Is he Northern or Southern?
- Ooh, interesting live question.
Live question for me that I am not prepared for.
Ooh, you're going to love this, Andrew.
Northern.
So top heavy.
If only most of the southern hemisphere weren't covered in water, we'd have more
of a chance.
It's true.
We need a special dolphin episode or something.
I was going to say, once you start that dolphin communication program, you're going
to be just swimming in subscribers.
Oh, beautiful pun. Haven't you seen what happens when you involve highly intelligent
Dolphins and human matters like in The Simpsons. It's not pretty.
We could do it differently. I really feel like we have the power.
Okay. Here's our live effort at recruiting dolphins.
Martin. Yeah. I would like you to make a dolphin call right now.
Jesus. How do you even do that?
Or something like that. I don't know what that is. That's good.
I got a struggling aqua mammal.
Oh my God. The emails are flying in.
Look at those subscriber emails just flying in.
Blowhole456@hotmail.com.
Jase, you've got to deal with that email.
Jason, make a call to some dolphins, please.
No, I'm not. I don't want to help the southern effort.
There are northern dolphins.
Maybe your accent will attract them.
I just did it telepathically.
Oh, my goodness. Oh, yeah.
I'm going to back Martin up here.
Oh, it's like a lamb being shot.
And in come the cancellations.
Let's get out of this dangerous place.
All right, moving on.
No, no, no.
I just got a message from Natasha in the other room saying I can't tell if that was supposed
to be a guinea pig squeak or one of those horny sounds that our cockatiel Rocky makes.
Because if you pat her a certain way and it's a certain time of year or something, you get
a sound like what we just did.
It's like, whoop, must stop patting.
Did not know that would occur.
So be careful.
Wow.
I can't wait to see your new subscribers.
I'm gonna have to branch you guys off to a different thing.
I think, cause this is a, I don't know if I want to be involved in that.
What do we have?
Do we want to go, do we want some foot, some foot action?
Yeah.
I'll give you some foot action.
Let's get some foot action in here.
What do you got Martin?
Foot action, a little bit of photography corner, although I don't want to go too
phone took us we know how bored Andrew gets.
He does.
I'm just I'm tuning out now.
Wake me when you're done.
He's already trying to type into his his watch.
I can already tell.
Yeah.
All right.
Well apologies to everyone who's completely uninterested in this.
Right.
So basically I thought I would do two mini reviews because I recently got two new cameras.
Two new cameras.
Yeah obviously.
And when I say new they're not really new but they're new to me and you might know about
them already but I thought, "Eh, why not? Let's go into this a bit." As you know, a
while ago, I signed up for Glass. Two of you followed, I think. Then you both left. I was
by myself. Yes. Felt dejected and, you know, alone in the world. Yes, you should. Then
you both rejoined and I went, "What the hell?" And you were like, "What do you mean? This
never happened." Never left. And then that's it. Yeah, basically. So then I rejoined. And
you know, I've been leaning into the whole photo thing, really enjoying it. It's like
Instagram reborn without all of the crap and I thought let's add to the
collection a bit so the first one is a camera that I bought myself because it
looked fun and the second one was a surprise early birthday gift from
Natasha first one if anyone who follows me on glass and I think Jason you
already saw this I did it's this 2011 little retro Olympus pen mini the EPM
one either of you familiar with this camera yes no what do you know about it
Jason. I remember first seeing it in a camera store in Japan, actually, and I thought it was
the most adorable and fun little camera I had ever seen because it came in so many different
little colors. It was awesome. It is a lot of fun. Yeah. And the thing that prompted me to get this
was that I've been following this. He's one of two kind of longstanding Olympus ambassadors or
visionaries. I don't think he's a visionary anymore. He left that role.
It's he I think well he could be a visionary in his photography but he doesn't have that
official label anymore. We'll put it that way. I'm not crapping on him. His name is Robin Wong
and he is this super enthusiastic Malaysian pro photographer and if you haven't watched him before
even if you're not into Olympus I'd recommend giving him a go just because he to me seems to be
like what YouTubers should be like. You know how there's that kind of stereotype of people
with thumbnails where it looks like they're yelling and they've got all these negative
views about technology. This guy's just super positive. He is not in the business of trying
to upgrade you constantly or get you to spend a lot of money. He actually did a video about
this camera saying, "Hey, this camera was released something like 12 years ago and you want to take
decent photos. It's micro four thirds. Just get in any number of compatible lenses, stick it on
this tiny thing and you've got an awesome camera for almost no money." And I was like, "Well, you
And you know what, I've got this newer Olympus AM10.
This is different, it's more of a point to shoot style
and you can stick things in the hot shoe if you want.
And it's just been an absolute joy.
I got it for a little bit more than 100 Australian dollars.
I'm sticking my other lenses on it
and it's just this great little purple thing.
And if I wanted to, I could stick that gigantic
100 to 400 on it.
- Which you absolutely should.
- Yeah, it's just hilarious.
At the moment I'm using the kit lens from the AM10,
the 14 to 42 millimeter and I'll include a link or photo in the show notes so people
can see.
Even if you're not into Olympus, even if you're not into it, you know, photography massively
in general, I thought it was worth bringing up because his positivity in his videos encouraged
me to try this cheap little thing and it's charming and just gives different photo results
than what you'd be used to from your iPhone.
So hopefully someone feels inspired to go and do some eBay purchases after that.
I will just say that I love that it's very, uh, unassuming.
So if you're out with that, it's just like, it's just a little dumb purple toy
camera.
Like it's not threatening to anybody, which I think is great.
It's a, it's a lot of fun until you put on the giant, like 4,000 millimeter
lens, and then it becomes a different story.
But with the kit lens on there, it just looks like whatever.
It's just some person to take in snapshots.
It's not a big deal.
I've got visions of Martin in his, with his purple camera, the giant lens wearing
the budgie smugglers, taking photos of birds over the fence.
Yeah, that would go down well.
And birds, we mean creatures, not women, right?
Avians.
Avian creatures.
Yes.
Perfect.
So anyone out there, if you're thinking about getting into photography, even if you're like a total amateur like I am, check out what's out there.
Maybe you have preexisting lenses that can connect to something.
It fits the brand that you already have.
I like that message that you can get into technology and improve things like photography
or video without having to spend a truckload of money.
So give it a go.
I do have one question, actually.
Yes.
Do you almost feel odd using, going out in the world with an actual camera?
Do people sort of give you funny looks?
Like why are you not using a phone?
That's a really good question.
I have actually had one or two comments.
Like recently when I went to the Botanic Gardens, I was just, you know, as I said, chasing birds
in the trees and stuff.
And one or two people walked past saying, "Oh, that looks sophisticated."
And it intrigued me that it was, you know, it stood out in that way.
But I'm not carrying any super pro equipment, like the camera itself, although it's, you
know, an expensive dedicated piece of equipment, it's not in the thousands of dollars, even
the lens isn't marked as pro.
So I haven't felt personally odd or strange, but I have had comments where people notice
that you're using something that isn't an iPhone.
Yeah.
I always just find that.
So like if I have the Sony, I find that people just assume that whatever I'm taking a photo
of is something very important.
Like it's gotta just be, there's some reason that he's looking at this thing, even if it's
like he's been hired by the local council or there's an event or something.
Yeah, I mean, it's probably likely like just some piece of trash in the gutter that I thought looked cool at an angle, but it's because the camera is not a phone.
You get that like, oh, what what is that?
What are they? What is he doing?
And it must be something really interesting.
And then they come over and like, what are you what are you looking at?
I like the gum wrapper in the gutter.
OK.
You hit on a good point because when you carry a camera like this,
whether it's a smaller point and shoot or a larger DSLR or mirrorless,
you're using it with more intention.
I'm not saying that people are snapping photos with their Android phones or iPhones
willy nilly, but you've taken this thing out with the purpose of family
photography or street photography or landscapes, wildlife.
You're thinking about a category like that.
So, yeah, I like the kind of state of mind that I enter
when I'm taking photos like that,
whereas it's less of a,
I'll just pull it out of the pocket and do that.
Although, Andrew, you asked if people thought it was odd.
I have taken the kind of care,
whenever I'm around like a playground,
when we take Mac out,
if I'm standing with him or I'm clearly with the family,
it's kind of understanding that context
that even though we're surrounded by surveillance cameras
in our daily life, everyone's using iPhones,
everyone's probably got hard drives full of strangers
in their photos.
the moment you carry something like that,
people are more wary.
So one time at one of Mac's swimming lessons,
I made a point of going to the instructors and saying,
"I have this thing, it's got a zoom lens.
"I'm photographing my son."
They go, "Oh, okay."
'Cause they think that you're a susso,
even though you're using a zoom lens
to focus on your one kid,
rather than an iPhone that captures every child in the room.
It's a bit weird how people's brains work,
but I try to think of that.
- Yeah.
I think it's harder for people,
because almost, you know, the vast majority of folks
have a cell phone camera of some kind.
- Yes.
- So it's just status quo, like that's just table stakes.
But most, especially because they have the phone camera,
they likely don't have or got rid of
the quote unquote real camera,
which then just makes it seem so much more like this
specialized tool that is only for very select things,
even though that used to be just all we had.
So that shift has very much happened
and we're so far past that tipping point now
from people having normal cameras to,
see there we go, normal.
Just having big standalone cameras compared to phones
that the farther and farther we get along,
the more it's just like,
why do you have that weird old specialized tool?
Like you're carrying around a microscope or something.
No, it's just a camera, but okay.
- Well, if you carry a macro lens, you almost kind of do,
but I don't do all of that. - Kind of, it's true.
- So the second one I wanna get to,
so I don't take over the entire episode.
This is something a bit more out of my comfort zone,
which I didn't expect, but it's an experimental item.
As I said, it was a gift from Natasha.
- Photographic views.
- A Lomography Lomo Instant Reykjavik camera.
- Those are cool.
- They still make Lomo cams, do they?
Wow.
- They do.
Now I had heard this name before,
but I wasn't really familiar with the brand
or what it's all about.
And before you jump in with potentially
judgmental questions,
I have not turned into some sort of
exclusive Cortado sipping hipster who will only use this.
- No, yeah.
- Jason's giving me funny looks.
- The countdown begins.
- Yeah, Natasha thought this would be a cool gift
and she was absolutely right.
I have never really dabbled in any kind of
instant photography.
And it's something that's supposed to be easy,
but this does actually give you some cool,
creative, multiple exposure, manual settings.
And I have to say,
I feel like a bit of a dumb person using this
because I realize how much my brain
has been geared towards digital photography.
And now suddenly it's like,
oh, I've only got this many bits of instant film in the pack.
Oh, I can't actually see what the results
are gonna be like until it spits out.
Oh, I have to turn manual dials.
So it's actually been a really early period
of very funny failure.
and I've been enjoying that.
- So those photos you posted recently were from this then.
I thought that was just like some hipster filter thing
you were using.
So did you scan those or did you just like take a,
how did you put those into your Glass feed?
- So I actually used a scanning app on the iPhone.
So the result that you see was used by the iPhone camera,
but it provided you hold it stable
and have consistent light at the same time of day or night,
you can get everything appearing as it actually does physically.
And if there was any reflection, I just slightly retouched it out.
But another testament to Glass thoroughly enjoyed this.
I noticed that you can have the categories of camera in Glass.
So I got in touch with support.
They got back to me.
Tom, I think it was one of the people who runs Glass, and they will actually
add cameras for you if you take a few shots
and it's not part of the the existing filter or discovery infrastructure.
So now you can go on there and you can see this camera tied to the ones that I put up with those instant shots
That's fantastic. I did not know that cool. So they're very obliging very lovely
This is not an ad for class by the way, it does feel like like they actually care about photography, which is nice
It's refreshing very much and he said yeah, you go and get an XF editor pop in the the data and it'll line up
Love it. Nice. Yeah that reminds me back when you were just a mere a mere little boy Martin probably like with that
Remember the photos we did of you of a little boy with the attitude.
Oh yeah yeah yeah with the 90s hair.
Yeah you're probably that age and I was in my photography mode as a grown adult you know because I'm so old.
Lomo photography was all the rage and I remember spending ages in.
Photoshop you know taking digital photos and then applying Lomo filters and trying to make trying to Lomoize.
My early digital photos and a lot of those hit I would publish on my first blog
And that was like I was really big because I used to do a daily photo on a blog
And I was that was like just you just a total blast on the past
I remember how impactful that whole Lomo effect was for a period of time. So thank you for that little that's cool
Do you still have these shots somewhere to him on your NAS?
I think some of them are on my NAS like buried way back in ancient archives
So yes, but the actual infrastructure of the blog. I think the best I ever got out of it was some WordPress
XML import export or something and I don't know I think I still have that but I don't think it means anything
But yes, I think some of those photos must still be around but how I would find them
I don't know short of just looking at every single one
See, we like to leave traps for people in OnePrime Plus, and one of those traps is in
the form of saying, "Send us a desk photo.
We'd love to see what your desk setup looks like."
Little do they know what is to come from sending us a desk photo.
We don't go lightly on this.
We are gonna tear in to some desks.
We've done it before.
We're gonna do it today and we'll probably do it again.
So watch out, okay?
But today we have such a desk.
Andrew, whose desk do we have today to just tear apart savagely?
Sure, we have a friend of the show and one time guest on the show.
So we've been spoken to him, so we know we can go hard on this guy.
It is HeyScottyJ from HeyScottyJ.com.
There you go.
So I didn't know that Hey was actually his first name.
Yeah, I just run with it.
First name Hey, middle name Scotty.
Yep.
Last name Jay.
Scotty Jay.
I know that Scotty Jay has gone back through.
He started listening mid run and he went back and listened from episode zero onwards.
Dedication.
I think he has heard some of the other desk reviews.
So he should know what he's signing up for here.
- Yeah, he still fell into our intricate trap.
- So have we all got the desk photo loaded, Martin?
- I do.
I do, it is open.
It is ready to go.
It's been a little while since we've done one of these.
I don't recall the number episode
the last time we did this,
but it was quite some time ago.
Did we have a format for this or do we just,
Is this just cage match and thumbtacks on the ground, ladders, trash cans?
What do we, what do we do?
Pretty much. And just for people of the Southern hemisphere, Jason was referring to drawing pins and rubbish bins.
Oh, right. And bins. Sorry.
And stick shoots or I don't know.
What do you call ladders?
I seem to recall we went one by one around and then if there was anything that wasn't touched upon at the end, it was a free for all.
Okay.
So I think, I think Martin as the polite one should really go first.
Okay. I'm the polite one. I love it.
Somehow I've done a total switcheroo from oppressive felled foot dictator who will
disembowel you and throw your guts all over the show notes.
Will you do that to us?
That's actually, that's actually what you are, but he's doing this just to hopefully live another day.
Well, I just want to make a broad comment about the photo first.
Okay. And that is, you know, when you can tell in a YouTube video or when someone sends you a desk shot in
general, maybe you asked for it, maybe not, that they've done some tidying or prepared for the
photo. I don't think this has been done here. I think having heard Hey Scotty J on Nested Folders,
his podcast, he was on this show reading the blog, knowing how much about productivity he really is,
I see great organisation in this photo. You've got beautifully compartmentalised shelves,
There are objects neatly arranged.
There's thoughtful placement everywhere.
And it doesn't look like it's a dedicated study area.
It looks like it's part of a lounge room or living area.
So we're talking someone who's thought very carefully
about the organisation of this room
and even the very minimalistic arrangement
and desktop wallpaper set up that he has on this monitor.
So I just wanna say, Scotty,
You've clearly got a very good system
and self-organization kind of routine going here.
More specifically though,
the height difference between the keyboard and the trackpad.
I think this could be evidence
of just how Zen Scotty can be,
because I know as a nerd and a very picky nerd,
this is probably more of a problem with myself
than maybe other people.
I think I would maybe struggle with that height difference
and I'd seek to optimize all of these various things.
He is obviously so zen with his setup
that he can tolerate different tools of different brands
and not be thrown off.
- I immediately, the first thing I did was
I just did zoom and enhance right into the middle,
right into the screen.
Like, let's see what's going on here.
And first of all, this wallpaper,
I don't know about this wallpaper.
It's a little too blue screen of death for me.
And maybe that's sort of calling back
to some repressed memories or something,
but it's just, it's a little bit off-putting to me.
this stark blue wallpaper.
So that, I might change that up a little bit.
Then of course, where do we go next?
We go to the dock.
So-- - The dock.
- Where is the dock?
Oh, well, it's in the correct place.
So bonus points for that, thank you.
Next, we start saying, okay, what is in the dock?
Like, let's get into his mind a little bit.
What's going on in this dock?
Well, we've got Safari and Chrome.
Okay, I'm assuming that's like a,
I'm gonna step back, I'm gonna assume
this is like a work/personal setup.
I think this whole setup is work and personal.
Much like myself, I don't think there's dedicated areas here
so I think that's why there's like a Chrome and a Safari.
That's my assumption.
There's a Things 3, we know he loves his productivity,
getting those things done.
No badges on anything.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and just say
turns them all off as part of that tidying.
Maybe or he just doesn't like badges.
I don't know.
Two copies of Bear because one is clearly not enough.
Mail, calendar, boring.
I think that's a Google thing, potentially.
I don't know.
Slack, again, work, maybe personal, not sure.
Messages, some kind of paper airplane thing.
Is that Telegram?
Telegram?
Don't know.
Maybe.
Okay, more messages.
Some kind of weird green cloud with an arrow.
No idea what the hell that is.
I couldn't tell you.
Does anybody have a guess on that?
I've never seen that before.
It's ridiculous.
Never.
And he's not running it.
Now he's going to tell us that that's like a handcrafted app that he made himself and
drew the icon.
It's a shortcut.
And we can feel bad about that.
Yeah.
There you go.
The app store in the doc.
That's interesting.
And then shortcuts because it's Skype.
Yeah, people, why are you being so nice?
It's not interesting, it's stupid.
(laughing)
Don't put the app store in the dock.
- Okay, well. - You might as well just have
mission control in there while you're at it.
- I think, this is very interesting,
I think just a couple of minutes into this,
we have gained more insights about our own characters
as co-hosts than I ever expected.
Who would have thought that I would be so
open and positive at the beginning?
Jason would be a little bit more, you know,
moderate, some pessimism,
and Andrew would just come out of the gate
Just full on.
- Shredding Scotty J.
- I haven't even started yet.
- Just brass knuckles on.
- I have not even started.
Buckle up.
- Well, I'm gonna step away from the computer for a minute.
I'm gonna zoom back out.
I'm gonna unzoom and enhance here a little bit.
And just the desk itself.
So I appreciate that he has liberated his desk
from an office environment.
I like that.
That's clear.
- It is kind of corporate, isn't it?
- It is, it's very corporate.
And maybe that's like a comfort thing, maybe that's his safe space, is the corporate, you
know, he loves that.
He's actually cocooned by the gentle corner of the desk.
Exactly, yep.
We got the little wrist thingy, and various things on the desk.
I'm not too broken up about any one thing on the desk.
I do feel like there's a lot of cables, just sort of all shooting back into that one hole,
but you know, given the desk, I guess that's where we're at.
There's the happy face on the left and the sad face or slash mad face on the right.
The logo, sorry, not the logo.
You mean the Lego heads?
The little Lego heads.
Yeah.
And I'm, I assume they're coasters, but it feels very deliberate that you would have
one of each to where, is this like some kind of sign that when someone walks in the room,
if the happy face is up, like we're good to go.
If it's the mad face, like maybe come back later.
Is this like a tell?
I don't know.
I'm not sure what's going on there.
Actually talking about the corporate desk set up.
If you look far to the right, you can see someone behind that other monitor.
So that is actually his manager in the other room.
Oh, with the door open because he obviously can't be trusted.
Yeah.
You see, I've taken a different view of that.
I thought he actually had like some sort of person captive in his house.
Hmm.
Could be with the door open.
Yeah.
Like, like Stockholm syndrome.
It's like, this is the best performance review I've ever had.
Scotty.
I don't think so because he's got this little thing with plants that he strategically placed there to try to like hide
What he's really doing. I think that's what's going on there
We got a home pod home pod mini there on the desk. That's good. What color is that several?
What's that? What color is it?
That is the yellow one. Okay, it's no orange. Not not the orange one. No
No, I have the orange one
Good. Yeah, that's yellow. Mm-hmm. Thanks
Oh, wait a second. I'm now realizing where is his camera?
Oh, you mean like for doing computer like a webcam?
Yeah.
Oh, what the hell?
There isn't one in the monitor. What's going on? Unless he...
Hmm.
Is he using some sort of continuity display thing because the computer itself isn't visible.
That's true. Where is the computer? That was strategically left out.
Sorry, continuity camera, my mistake.
Where do you think the computer is?
Well, is that is that the computer over there by the microphone on that little it's not a computer. Is it?
Way of them. No, I was I was gonna bring that no you're talking about past the sofa on the black table. There's like
some kind of I
Don't know what that is. It looks like a Thunderbolt dock or something
Why is it just sitting by itself way over on a table on a coffee table? Yeah, it's odd. Wait
wait
It's connected to the TV which means the computer is somewhere over there and he's somehow watching something on his on that TV over there.
Second monitor so he's pretending to work on the little monitor meanwhile watching TV over on the on the left.
His TV is that an actual fireplace or another TV showing fake fire.
I hope to hell that it is another TV show from Florida ceiling.
Is that a couch is a couch between the TV and the.
Think so.
No offense Scotty but if you're sitting on that couch you're awfully close to both the TV and the fire.
And that is very warm could be a little uncomfy.
What's the thing between the home pod mini and the lounge cushions is that one of those Phillips Hue kind of light things or.
It is a mirror it's a makeup mirror.
No okay for getting for getting ready for his calls on his camera that he doesn't have exactly.
Okay and then we have the very Lux iPad to the right I have big questions about this Jason but yeah.
I have no idea what the hell vera lux is is that some sort of weird Canadian thing.
But it looks like I think you can assume everything in the photo is a weird Canadian thing probably right what day what the hell is this thing it looks like it's trying to be an iPad.
But also trying to be a remarkable tablet but with one of their like air conditioning buttons on the bottom of something.
What?
It's the newest it's the newest Kindle air that has an air conditioner built into it
I found out what it is. I've looked it up. Okay. What is it? Oh, that's cool. So it's a light therapy lamp
Featuring adjustable color temperature and a countdown timer that allows you to personalize your experience. So it actually is like one of those daytime
thingies like you're outside
Okay, cuz he's not allowed to leave what for so I'm picking up a real thing here now, so he's got wellness lights
He's gone
plants
And off in the back corner
He's got the yoga mats not just yoga mat like a yoga studio. There's like a wall of mats over there
I think he's running classes out of this place. I'm wondering if Scotty Jay is not
Freelancing a bit of thank you. Well, that's on the side
Think so we've just we've just unlocked the secret how can you be well if you don't have a mouse this is my question he's got that trackpad.
No man's never trackpad I feel fine yeah I don't use a mouse.
Wow okay and I'm off the Scotty Jays strategy here trackpad only.
And you guys have all seriously you both I'm really disappointed in both of you out of practice on this desk review business because you haven't really aggressive today and you're roasted nearly enough.
Okay so can I just change change the pace a little bit here yes I'm just gonna have a little angry I'm just gonna laundry list of complaints okay.
Okay complain away.
Okay he's got one home pod mini in yellow why is he not got another home pod mini and blue for the hemispheric views appreciation.
He has now that microphone is that is that a fair he would to be fair would be the orange home pod many in the but go ahead.
Is that a condenser microphone.
It's not a dynamic microphone is it it's not direction blue yeti yeah they can they can dance around that 360 pick up.
But he has a different patterns switch on the back house can say what's the point of a pop filter when it's picking up.
Sound from everywhere so it's got it's got little selectable patterns that you can do with okay okay you previously mentioned the fact that he's literally stolen an entire desk from a corporate office which is pretty liberated but yes put in your lounge room.
And then that TV now Scotty as a fellow person who is suffering the same fate I understand you have now got a built-in cupboard situation you want a bigger TV and you can't get it because you've got the cupboard that is restricting.
You know at one time I lost 42 inches seem like nothing would be ever be bigger than that you would think not and now it's stuck with undersized TVs you've got that little lightning cable just curled up.
On the edge there.
Put it in drawer mate, come on don't just leave that there, that's disgusting.
It's very neat though, maybe he needs to use it fairly often, what's the problem? It's in indecent exposure, I don't want to see that. Wow.
I do like his little Nintendo watch, is it a watch charger?
Or is it just a squeezy?
Oh, the little Gameboy, I think that's a watch charger. Yeah, okay.
It looks cool but it's gonna be pretty awkward putting your watch in there.
The keyboard I have this just assuming difficulty it's like oh, that's cool, but I'm sure there's a problem with it. I
Have this keyboard as well
So I know what he's dealing with but to keep this keyboard
You can't be your daily runner because the the backspace delete keys are all badly designed
You never hit them when you want to you always hit that little
The the light button in the corner accidentally. So this is the the key key chronique run. Hey
- I think it is. Yeah, he's sensibly running it in wired mode, not Bluetooth. So that's good. And Scotty chat. I'm sorry
This whole bank monitor thing like just take a good hard long look at yourself, mate
Okay, I was talking last week about maybe getting the
Samsung ripoff of the of the studio display, but this is taken to a whole new level
What is it like 24 inches at best? It's probably 4k if that
Not even convinced it might be 1080
You've got like
Promotion for HDMI and LED that you're just looking at all day
Really? How do you live with that? Just looking at those. Give me a break and
Going back to your doc. I just want to say oh god
Okay, you've got two two versions of bear
Why are you using bear in the first place? Come on? We all gave up on bear three years ago
So lift your game on that one
(laughing)
- Oh my God.
- I reckon Canadians are known for being
very polite people.
And I don't think Scotty has probably ever experienced
the kind of general anger in his life,
at least within Canada,
that he just experienced the most in QA Andrew.
- And only related to his desk area.
Like this is just about his desk and that's--
Who knows what would happen if you went to his wardrobe or something Andrew?
Is there like full on, you know?
I can't even imagine.
Does this spark joy?
What's in your drawers?
Come on.
Yeah.
He just start cutting stuff with a knife and burning things probably.
It's like, why do you have family photos?
What year is it?
You idiot.
What, you love your family or something?
What a loser.
Who even has photos anymore?
And why are they in that order?
I wouldn't have done that.
No, definitely not.
Clearly that is the wrong
Okay, two things here there's two Xbox controllers just sitting right out of reach that's concerning because now you're just constantly looking at that and
feeling like I
Wish I was doing that instead of whatever the hell I'm doing. Mm-hmm. So somewhere in this room that we can't see
There is a whiteboard. Do you know why I say that?
Because he kept stealing stuff from the corporate office. Is that an assumption that is part of it
But if you look at the depths underneath the desk to the left, there's a little spray bottle
of that little whiteboard cleaner.
Wow.
Good spotting.
Wow.
So, I think there's a whiteboard in here, which really, really makes me mad that we
did not get a picture of the whiteboard.
Because everyone knows we love a picture of a whiteboard.
I mean a whiteboard is just like, oh, it's so good.
So I'm a little upset that we didn't get that.
- Yeah, but to be fair, it's probably covered
in highly confidential corporate strategy
that we're not privy to.
- Or illustrations of downward dog.
- Oh, that's true.
Maybe it was next week's class.
It could be.
Maybe he streams the yoga classes
and that's where the camera is.
- Twitch.tv/heyscottiyoga.
- Hey Scottiyoga, but with a soft J.
Just runs all together.
Correct.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a new business venture for you, Scotty.
Hey, Scotty, yoga.
And if that doesn't work out, you just keep the same spelling and say it's an
alternative way of saying jogger.
And you take people for a jog.
There you go.
Yep.
And you've got extra money in your pocket cause you've surely canceled your
subscription to 1.5 plus after this.
Um, okay.
So if you, for some unknown reason, wish this could be your desk/workspace,
get ahold of us at the One Prime Plus secret address.
And you'll know what that secret address is if you are a One Prime Plus member.
Have you been to all of the states and territories in Australia?
And follow up to that how many of the states have you been to in the United States?
Obviously for me, I've not been to Australia yet.
So I have zero for you all, but I was curious how many of your own and how many here?
Okay.
I'll start with Andrew.
All right.
I have been to in Australia.
I've been to Western Australia to the Northern Territory to Queensland to New South Wales to Victoria.
I was born in Tasmania and I have driven through South Australia although South Australia be the one most underrepresented.
So.
I have driven through.
So I don't think that really counts but all the others so I'm on my bingo card I'm missing one now as I.
So I lost track of your life story there did you say you went to the Australian capital territory or not oh yes been there number of times.
I couldn't sorry continue with your life's journey.
No that's all I'm going to pause for a moment as I bring up the map of.
The United States and you can run through your Australian locations man so it will Andrew you said there was one that you hadn't been to South Australia.
Oh you drove through it, you didn't actually go there.
Okay.
Okay I've just been checking in case I was completely crazy but I can say that I've been to every state and territory other than the Northern Territory.
Okay I assumed it was going to be a pretty high percentage given that it's just it's a lower number total so.
Yeah, but to be fair like I'm not driving, you know across the Nullarbor Plain or
through
Kakadu or something like there's a lot of space to cover. So there are particular points in the states and territories
Yeah, you you would have to have a reason to go there. You're not just accidentally passing through. It's like oh wow
How did the Dane tree get there?
Okay, so US states you've both been to the United States at some point
Andrew how many US states have you visited?
This is a little bit tricky.
I'm going to need probably some assistance here.
So I've been to Washington DC, but that's not really a state, right?
So how does that work out?
No, that's fine.
I would count that's adequate.
Okay.
It's more the controversial election kind of status there, isn't it?
They have a different way of being or not being represented.
I remember bumper stickers with like people represent something without representation or taxation taxation without representation probably yeah yeah yeah so yes Washington DC went through what's Philadelphia is that like
Set Pennsylvania there you go okay and then New York been in New York see this cities but what's is it New York New York I know what is it New Jersey I don't know been there that New York.
I'm being to Florida New Jersey been to Florida.
Floor okay now we're all the way South been to Tennessee random okay being to.
What's the other one I'm looking on the mat.
Virginia so drove through drove through like think it was Virginia don't think it was West Virginia.
Maybe stay with that you clarify that because it sounded like you said virginia for a second.
I think it was working on getting Virginia next thing is Virginia stayed overnight there.
Okay, then going over the other coast it is
California, okay, so you have been I was wondering if Tennessee was the furthest west but now you've been not been to California
I think that is it. My family has done a lot more than that. I thought you had been to Texas
No, no, my dad was born in Texas
Yeah, I lived there for a long time. I never went okay
I had a sister who was born in Florida brother born in New Jersey, but I've never really been to those places
So I can't hmm in in relation to them
My family lived in Utah, but I didn't I wasn't born so all these places. I can't claim. Okay, so you got a handful
That's about it. All right, Martin. What do you got? I know of a couple of yours, but oh well
I've only ever been to the United States once and the only places that I actually
Visited properly as a tourist rather than like I know driving or catching a train through would be New York State
DC as its own thing kind of separately and California
So I haven't been to any other states across the US. Okay, there you go. I
Had no idea. I knew I mean, I well, I guess I knew Martin had been to California obviously because I physically saw him there
But other than that I was I was curious how that was gonna go, okay, cool
What do you know? I mean, I guess that what you expected. Yeah. Yeah about that
Yeah
I wouldn't have expected it to be super high because a there's a crap ton of states and to get to
multiples of them just takes a lot of time so I
Very much figured you were either gonna fly to a state and then leave that state verse like traveling through a bunch of them
So that's about what I expected. What about you? Well for me as I've already said I've been to zero in Australia
I've not been there yet
I almost went there once and then it got pulled out from under me at the last minute
So that is unfortunate and then as far as the US goes, I believe I've been to every state
Except three Wow think seriously Wow
7 yeah, I believe and I could be off by one
But I went through the list and I think the only ones that I've not been to our Alaska
Delaware and Maine Wow now we know Maine is not on the list because of the Portland issue so they've just well
Yeah, that's just we I just chose to not acknowledge the entire state
Yeah, well, I think that's just a matter of distance because Maine is way the hell up there
So you have to really want to get up there and then Alaska same thing is way the hell over there
So just hasn't happened. I feel like the e on the end of Maine is trying to be a bossy
But it's redundant like a and I are already doing the work. So why is that there?
I mean when when you when you have the second best Portland, what do you want?
Got to try hard, you know, we've crapped on that said enough for no apparent reason
There's so many places in the US that I want to go to though
I feel like you know, you hear so much about them and you feel like you know them already
I feel like you're a Salt Lake City guy. I
Just want to see if that would elicit a reaction. Salt Lake City. I think I think it probably
cops a hard time because of its
Culture. Ooh fun game. I just thought of a fun game. Can we do a fun game quickly? Sure. Yeah, we've got time
Maybe go it's quick
It's gonna be I'm gonna pick which US state each of you most belong to oh great
And you're gonna say which part of Australia I most
Oh, okay. All right. What do you think about that?
Think about this. Are you gonna face Jason? Okay. Okay, you might have to cut a little bit of silence out
Well, I quickly scan a map and decide
Where you all are going to be. Oh, this is tough. Ooh so many options. Okay, Andrew
Mmm, you are
Going to be in I'm gonna go somewhere like
Midwest actually like kind of
Oklahoma, Kansas
Alaska maybe
Wow, that's brutal. Yeah, I think what's wrong with that. Maybe there's a good reason. Maybe there's a positive reason
Don't jump to conclusions. I just I get like a
lot of land
farm kind of vibe
This is what I'm getting right now.
I think it might that might be playing into it a little bit possibly.
Yeah, maybe.
Well, you aren't there anymore.
Either that or I might go Arizona for you.
Possibly.
Okay, that's I think I like that idea more.
Why Arizona?
I kind of just get like a Phoenix, Arizona vibe from Andrew a little bit.
Okay, I can do that.
I'm willing to do that.
That's wrong. I'm okay with that. Okay
Martin who boy this is a tall order. What are we gonna do with you? We are gonna stick you
I'm I'm leaning a bit California to be perfectly honest. Oh, oh, let's cut right what you ask, but wait
There's two distinct California's. I know I'm aware of that. There's Northern California and Southern, California
So which of those is Martin?
And I'm actually gonna probably go
Central to Northern California, I think
For Martin, so what's yeah, what city is that? What am I like? What you think although?
He could be
Mmm, he could be like a Colorado - I think
Potentially, right. So maybe one of those I'm gonna go with that. I gave Andrew a couple options
I think I'm gonna go with that. I don't think any of you are East Coast
Really?
Okay. No, I think you're you're what's what's the Northern California?
Colorado vibe. Why do you say that? I just get I get this sort of
fast but slow from you
Hmm, that's I'm thinking that's that's where you need to be slow as in relaxing or slow mentally
uh, I was going with relaxing but
I like that I feel that's pretty accurate which one you choosing Martin you're in Colorado you're going to know Cal.
I do like the idea of like Colorado weather there's there's snow there right that's a thing so I like that but at the same time I've grown up near the water.
Like to not have a coastline would disturb me a little bit in the long run so I would choose California basically because of the location nothing in Colorado.
I'd like to visit Colorado from California easy enough something like Eureka is that we were looking set north.
Set no cow it's it's not nor Cal North sorry okay where am I moving who would you like to class you first Jason.
Well given the desk review I think I'll start with Andrew.
Okay now you're a bit of a conundrum.
He's just gonna have me out in the middle of the ocean.
He thought you were a conundrum.
Yeah we're sending you, there's a little place called Christmas Island we're sending you to.
Oh come on.
It's always festive there.
Jason I think you, you're a difficult one.
Thank you.
But I think ultimately to find your happy place I'm gonna have to send you to Victoria.
I was gonna say exactly the same thing.
Wow.
And I think not regional Victoria.
I think you need to be in Melbourne, probably St Kilda or something like that.
100% what I was going to say.
He is a Melburnian.
Wait, wait.
Wow.
This is shocking.
You both just same, right?
No question.
Right down to the location.
Is that right, Martin?
You said Melbourne.
Melbourne.
And then I said even maybe something like St Kilda.
Yeah, he'd be a kind of Ackland Street bakery guy and then dip into the CBD for some Laneway coffee.
Yeah, I could see the Laneway coffee life.
Yeah, definitely.
Duck down to the Luna Park, maybe take some snaps around the Palais Theatre, stick them up on glass.
Yeah. Yeah.
Wow.
Maybe get another tattoo.
Yeah.
Hop on the tram, talk about how it's so much better than Sydney's since they tore theirs down and had to put them back.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. That sounds great.
Yeah.
But then in line with the rather painful extended lockdowns that Victoria had and maybe kind of became used to against its will, it would suit Jason's preference to often stay home.
I do like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
And I'm close to Tasmania, so I got that going for me.
Exactly.
Not worth a lot.
- I'll just say, you know,
I think the best way to kind of characterize Australia
is a lot of land surrounded by a lot of water
covered with a relatively small population
of very diverse people,
but most people, particularly Western Australia,
feel forgotten because Sydney and Melbourne
basically argue about which one's better on the news.
And you would be in the artsy equivalent.
You're not counting, of course, obviously,
the Opera House and various cool things we have up here
that Victoria unfortunately doesn't have,
but they've got other cool things.
They're better at managing sport events for a start,
like classy tennis and Grand Prix.
- Sydney would be too buttoned up.
- I'm gonna have to get really good
at getting rid of my R,
'cause that's gonna be very problematic if I live there.
- Your R?
- Why, could you say Melbourne?
- There's an R in there that you choose to ignore,
and I'm gonna have-- - Just say Melbourne.
- Melbourne. - No, but you're not even,
you're not even ignoring the R,
you're actually just changing the entire sound
of how the syllable looks. (laughing)
You're just going boom.
- It's not even about ignoring it,
It's just completely ignoring the entire word
and making up that--
- It's like you took the B-O-U-R-N-E
and just made it B-N.
- Yeah, Melbourne.
- And if you come from there,
you actually mispronounce the E as an A,
so you actually say Melbourne.
That's a sore spot for them.
They can't say the E, some of them, unfortunately.
- Melbourne.
- Yeah, no, it doesn't have to be too strong.
Just a bit of a, just an E that's enough of an A
that you weren't sure if it was an A or not.
Melbourne.
- Yeah.
I love how basically speaking there is like anything that would normally be a letter or sound like get it down to about 3% of its total value and that's basically what you have to do.
I feel sorry for the people who live in the suburb of Melbourne in Melbourne.
Oh I would definitely not buy a house there because that would just be far too confusing.
You know we feel almost forgot to say what I was forgot to say you would also be living in the city that was almost called Batman or Batman or Batmania really.
Batman City would be awesome.
Mr Batman or Batman if you want to put it that way it would have been Batmania so it would have been like an alternative Gotham or Goat Ham I think I actually heard was the correct pronunciation for the British Isles.
Which was then made Gotham which now would be Batmania which is Melbourne but it's actually Melbourne.
Yes, that is where I live just write me a letter at that address. You're more than you bargained for Jason
I'm gonna start I'm going on realestate.com.au and gonna try and find Jason a house
Beep bop beep boo
